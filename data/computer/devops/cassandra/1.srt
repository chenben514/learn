### Introduction: 
---
Cassandra is a "NoSQL Distributed DataBase"
* 1 installation = 1 node
* capacity = 2~4 TB
* thousands of operations a second per core
* leaderless peer-to-peer system through **gossip**
* all node belong to the same data center


2
00:01:42,991 --> 00:03:00,587
### Characteristic:
---
1. Perabyte Database
2. High Availability
3. Geographic Distribution
4. Performance
5. Vendor Independant


3
00:03:14,686 --> 00:04:28,131
### Partition
---
* 相同 Partition 的資料實體放在一起


4
00:04:28,131 --> 00:07:49,175
### Replication
---
* Each node has Partition Tokens
* Replication Factor (RF) 表示存幾份相同 Partition 的資料, 3 is the standard
* Coordinator Node 處理 request 


5
00:07:49,175 --> 00:09:49,530
### Consistency
---
* Consistency Level (CL) of Quorum, 以 RF=3 為例, 寫成功要3個都成功，讀成功則至少要2個


6
00:09:56,730 --> 00:12:02,338
### Use Case
---
1. Scalability
2. Availability
3. Distributed
4. Cloud-native
