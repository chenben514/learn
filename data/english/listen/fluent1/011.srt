1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Four.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,400
What do you think of your city?

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,080
It is a very special place.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,240
There is nowhere else in the world like my city.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,800
It's so romantic.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,200
What's the city centre like?

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,600
The buildings are beautiful and we have San Marco,

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
one of the most famous churches in the world.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
San Marco Square is wonderful and during Carnival in February,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
Venice is the best place in the world to be.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,160
Do you like living here?

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
No, I really hate living here.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,280
It's horrible.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,200
There are too many tourists everywhere.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,800
Oh dear.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,320
What are the shops like?

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,720
Well, because of the tourists, the shops are too expensive

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,000
and the canals are dirty and polluted.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,880
My city is not big enough for all these people.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,000
Why don't they leave us in peace?
