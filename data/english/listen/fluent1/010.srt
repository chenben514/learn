1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Three.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Where do you live?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, I live in a small village with my parents.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My grandparents live here too, and my aunts and uncles.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In fact, I think I'm related to about 50% of the people in my village.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's your village like?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's very pretty.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The countryside is beautiful and the air is lovely and clean.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But it's too quiet.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I find it so dull and boring here.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There aren't any discos or cinemas.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What are the people like?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, they're lovely.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But there aren't many young people.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to go and live in the city.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Soon.
