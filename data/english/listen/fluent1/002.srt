1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
1. Me.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,840
Tape script 1.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,680
My first name's Susan,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,720
but the only person who calls me Susan is my dad.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,820
Oh, and my sister when she's angry with me, but [fortunately] that doesn't happen very often now.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,560
Most of my friends call me Sue and so do the people I work with.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,800
My old friends call me Magsy because my [surname] is Mags,

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,080
and I was always called Magsy at school.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
I hated it.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,440
Of course,

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,520
there's only one person who calls me mum, and that's my son.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,240
But when he's with his friends, he calls me Sue.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,960
My mum calls me sweetheart, and my best friend calls me Suzanne because she's French.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,880
My Japanese [sister-in-law] calls me Suki.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,680
[Apparently], Suki means loved one in Japanese, so that's really nice.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,960
My husband calls me Bunny, but that's another story.
