1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Tape script 9. Everything's wrong here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They do everything wrong here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They eat far too much meat and they eat it at 11pm.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yesterday we went out to dinner at 11.30 and we had trouble getting a table.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
At 1am we were still eating and the restaurant was still half full.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They smoke too many cigarettes.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They drink lots of strong coffee and a lot of wine.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They spend too many hours in the sun and they certainly don't get enough sleep.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
One Saturday night we went to a disco at 2am and were surprised to see that there were only a few people on the dance floor.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then the DJ arrived at 3am and the party began.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There are far too many cars in the cities and there's too much noise everywhere.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They do everything wrong here but the quality of life is great and people really know how to enjoy themselves.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't want to go home.
