00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Dave Carter's my best friend.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,480
We met when we were five years old because our parents were friends and we went to the same school.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,260
He works in a different city now, so I only see him at weekends and during the holidays.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,700
He's important to me because he knows me so well.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,120
We have a really good laugh together and we enjoy the same things.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,420
Football, clubbing, girls, the usual stuff.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,740
When I'm feeling down or when I need to talk to somebody I can always call him.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,760
Recently I had girlfriend problems, and he was great. He's a really good listener.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,380
He just lets you speak and he listens.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
But he isn't perfect.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,000
He's always late for everything and he never says sorry, never.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,080
The last time I saw him was last weekend.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,200
We arranged to meet at four o'clock to play football and he arrived at half past six. It was nearly dark.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:19,160
Oh well, nobody's perfect are they? He's still a really good mate.
