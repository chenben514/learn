1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
2. Place.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Tape script 7. 1.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Do you like your city?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh yes. I feel lucky to be living in a city that's so big and exciting.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I love looking out of my apartment window, over the high-rise buildings.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's the city centre like?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Some people say it's too noisy and crowded, but I love that.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There's always something to see and do.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We also have the most famous beach in the world, Copacabana Beach.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then, on the other side of the city, there are beautiful mountains.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The highest one is called Corcovado, and it has the famous statue of Christ.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you look down at the city from there, the view is spectacular.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's the weather like?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's great most of the time.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The only time I don't like Rio much is in the summer. It's too hot and humid.
