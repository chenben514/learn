00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,912
Have you ever thought you were going to die

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,776
Yeah it was when I was eight or nine and I was at the beach with my parents

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:18,176
I was playing in the city but on the edge because I couldn't swim suddenly I realized I couldn't feel the bump

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,992
Tennessee was pulling me further away from the beach

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,344
Profuse seconds I panicked how do I start

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
Then I felt really calm

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,928
As if I was floating away

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,720

00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,560
Fortunately someone saw me and pulled me out in time
