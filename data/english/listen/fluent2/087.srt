00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
11

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,304
Journey

3
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,352
Typescript 40

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,240
It must be very strange to be back home after such a long time

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,336
I mean it's lovely to see everybody and I really appreciate my bed

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,128
Let's look at these photos then

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,992
Well they're all mixed up at the moment I'm going to show the map this look nice where is it

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,808
What do you think it is

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
It must be somewhere really hot

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
It looks like paradise

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,720
I suppose it could be Thailand or Bali

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,512
Or could he be Thea

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Nah

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
I'll give you a clue

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
It's annoying and in the Pacific Ocean

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Hawaii

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
No

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
I didn't go to Hawaii

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,336
I thought you'd been everywhere AJ then that's right

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
That was lovely

21
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
This man wanted me to marry his daughter she was beautiful and waiting that would have been

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Yeah that's what I thought

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,392
But I don't think my mom would have been very pleased

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
Anyway

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,488
What about this one this is a bit different

26
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,328
Well must be Switzerland or somewhere in the French Alps

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
Nut

28
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,888
Who's the girl by the way

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
Oh yes that's it

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,544
What's your name

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
Not

32
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,408
In this picture she wasn't far from home

33
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
What county auction Tina can it

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
Maybe chili no

35
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
It's the southern part of Argentina

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
Patagonia they call it the Switzerland of the southern hemisphere

37
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Rising

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,048
It really does look like Switzerland

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
So anyway

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,888
Did you meet a girl in every country visited
