I just had a cold for me and Watson at Smith's insurance

They got a problem with the program we installed on my network last week

I told you I'll get somebody out there as soon as possible to sort it out

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,344
Could you phone him first thing tomorrow morning and arrange to go out there and see what you can do
