1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Take script 54

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
Carmel

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,424
Do you mind if I ask you how old you are

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,240
Actually I'd rather not say

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,824
But put it this way on the wrong side of 30

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,616
Is that a good age to be

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,920
Yes pretty good

8
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,016
It's a lot older than 25 which is how old

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
What's life like when you're in your thirties

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,976
. very different from my twenties except that I'm seriously thinking of buying more expensive face creams and

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
Wondering if they really work

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,328
What do you think is the best age to be

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
Between 25 and 30 is a good age because you kind of sort it out what you want

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,080
And you know how to get it and you've got some experience of trying to guess it

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
At that age you don't think about the consequences of

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,760
What you do when I was when you have been told that you do tend to worry about the consequences

17
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
So

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,832
Do you wish you were still 25

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
No

20
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,392
I'm happy at the age I am now

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,512
I mean I had a good time in my twenties but I wouldn't necessarily want to relive them
