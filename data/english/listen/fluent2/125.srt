1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Take script 54

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,072
Yvette

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,936
You've just had an important stay haven't you

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,984
Well not really

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,056
These days 18 is the important one

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
So

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
How does it feel to be 21 exactly the same as 20

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,272
Is there anything you can do now that you couldn't do before you were 21

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,064
No not really

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,440
But I suppose when you're 21 you have more responsibilities

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,816
You're supposed to be more independent and you can't depend on your parents so much

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,912
I like to I have to pay for my holidays myself now

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,728
These are the disadvantages

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,336
And people expect grown-up behavior from you

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
What do you reckon is the best age to be

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,968
Maybe five years old

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,064
You go to play school and you play all day

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,648
Happy Buddha spoilers you and life is just fun

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,232
Have you ever wished you were older or younger

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,608
When I was about 15 my brother was allowed out and I wasn't

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,472
He's three years older than me and I wanted to be the same age as him
