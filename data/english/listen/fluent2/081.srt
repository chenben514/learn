1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
10

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,048
Time

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,864
Typescript 36

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:14,336
Atwood Sonny Vazquez midnight in Vermont

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
No

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,176
Do you make the best of your time

7
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,760
In the studio today we've got Roberta Wilson

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,088
Who's that time Management Consultant good morning Roberta

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
Good morning Paul

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,928
Roberta what exactly the time

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
Consultants to

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,328
Well Paul it's all about helping people to organize their work in an effective way

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
Maximum efficiency

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
Minimum stress

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Sounds like something I need

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
Who are your clients

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Mainly business people but I've also worked with politicians civil servants and University lectures

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,408
Quite a range that

19
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,992
What sort of things help people to organize their time

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
I suppose punctuality is it

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,856
Important yes and no

22
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,696
It's easier to finish a meeting on time if it starts on time but

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,024
In international context you do have to be aware of

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
Cultural

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
For example

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Well

27
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
In Britain big formal meetings usually start on time but less formal meetings often begin a few minutes

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
In Germany on the other hand

29
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,384
People expect all meetings to begin on time

30
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
In some countries for example Latin America

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
There's some more relaxed attitude

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
So you do have to adapt

33
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
To circumstance

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,160
When in Rome to some extent yes

35
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:39,072
It sounds like even if you manage your own time very well you still can't control what other people do

36
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
Well you can set limits

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
If you're meeting a friend who always arrives late you can say

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Well

39
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
I'm going to wait for 15 minutes

40
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
If they aren't there by then

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
I'll leave

42
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
I've got one friend who's always late

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
I don't think I'd ever see her if I did

44
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,576
People who are always late are the ones you need to set limits with

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
If they know that you won't wait

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
Perhaps they'll make an effort

47
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Isn't that

48
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
Rather harsh not really

49
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,352
Someone who constantly turns up late is putting a low value on your time

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
Let them know you got other things to do

51
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
Suggesting you do that with everyone

52
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Just a sister

53
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Latecomers

54
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
Again

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,408
Different cultures do have different viewpoints on what constitutes serious lateness

56
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
What about interrupt

57
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
I often come into the studio with

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
Something important I need to do

59
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
Then the phone rings

60
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Someone comes to see me

61
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Before I know it

62
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
The day's over and I haven't done what I planned

63
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
You need to defend your time

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
If you're working on something important

65
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
And someone drops in to see you

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
Get your diarrhea

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
Politely tell them you're busy

68
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
I make an appointment for another time

69
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,384
Is it is an important anyways I'll just go away if it is

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
Make an appointment when you can deal with it properly

71
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
That sounds practical

72
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
Again you do have to be careful

73
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,160
In some cultures particularly Latin ones this technique can upset people

74
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
Here in the United States almost

75
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,072
So does everything depend on culture

76
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
No

77
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,448
Attitudes to time or one of the big differences between cultures but

78
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
How you organize your own work is up to you

79
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
And there are lots of techniques here

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
For example

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,176
Imagine you got two important things to do

82
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
One of them is Pleasant

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
The other isn't

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,576
Always try to do the unpleasant task first

85
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,416
That way the pleasant tasks is a reward for finishing

86
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:46,560
If you do it the other way around you'll tend to slow down the pleasant tasks because you don't want to do the unpleasant one

87
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
I remember that

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:54,240
Finally what for you is a hardworking person so I'm not very interested in

89
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Hard-working people

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,616
You can spend 12 hours a day at the office without doing very much

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
Interested in productive and happy people

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
And on that note I have to say we've run out of time

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Thank you Roberta

94
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
Andover to Jasmine.
