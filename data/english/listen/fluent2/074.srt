Hi Grandma

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Hello dear

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
How's it going

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
Don't ask

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
Are you still thinking about Katie

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,512
Yes I can't get her off my mind I don't know what to do

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840
I thought you got over her I had

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
Until I saw her again

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,240
When she told me she'd broken up with John all the old feelings came back

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
The Daniels

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:48,640
What about Ernie can the wedding I know I thought I loved any

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,944
When I asked her to marry me I meant it but

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
Now I

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,992
Not sure how I feel

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Look why don't you go away for a few days and think about it

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,160
How about going to stay with Dave and Claire

22
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
They love to see you

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,488
But I thought Dave was in Mexico

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
Oh yeah she is isn't he

25
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,400
Are you could talk it through with her

26
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Yes

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
That's not a bad idea

28
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
I'll go and see her tomorrow
