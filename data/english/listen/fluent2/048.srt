1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Typescript 20

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,584
Second memory

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,632
The Great Mouse plot

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,056
My second and only other memory of slammed at Cathedral School is extremely bizarre

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,616
It happened a little over a year later

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,152
But I was just 9

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,712
By then I'd make some friends

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,296
But I walk to school in the mornings I would start out to loan

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,880
Ford pickup for other boys in my own age along the way

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
Office

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:34,048
Same for boys and I would set out together across the Village Green and through the village itself

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
Heading for home

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:40,960
On the way school and on the way back we always passed the Sweet Shop

14
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
No

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
We didn't we never posted

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
We always stopped

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
The sweet shop in 1923 was the very center of our lives

18
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
To us it was Walt

19
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,344
Is to a drunk

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
Or churches to a bishop

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
Without it they would have been little to live for

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
But he had one terrible drawback the Sweet Shop

23
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,352
The woman who owned it was a hora

24
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
We hated her

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,448
We had good reason for doing so
