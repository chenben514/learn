1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Tates Creek 35

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:09,728
Pacific Heights seeing 3

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,504
I think I know where Charlie is

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Where

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,320
He's going to see Claire

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,368
I'm sure there's something going on

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
Between Charlie and Claire

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,000
Claire is married to Uncle Dave

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,072
So let's a married people have affairs

10
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Well

11
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
I don't think it's right

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
Anyway how do you know

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
I heard him talking to her on the phone yesterday

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
The actor of David left for America and then he said he couldn't wait to be in your arms again

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
What a creep

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
Poor Becky

17
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,528
Don't worry she'll get over it

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
Listen

19
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,576
I've got an idea

20
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,648
If it's about Charlie coming traveling with us forget it

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
He's already said he doesn't want to but if we catch him with Claire we can blackmail him to come traveling with us

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
I see what you mean don't you think we should tell Becky about him and clay

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Cuerno stupid

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,848
If we tell her we won't be able to Blackmail a let's make a plan
