1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Typescript 21

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,352
A name

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,888
Was mrs. Pratchett

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,496
He was a small skinny old hag with a mustache on upper lip

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,312
And I'm not force our is a green gooseberry

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,104
She never smiled

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,200
April is grey and greasy

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,528
Eyebrows had bits of breakfast all over it

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,880
Toast crumpets and tea stains and splotches of dried egg yolk

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
It was her hands however the disturbance most

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
They were disgusting

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,816
They were black with dirt and grime

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
Do not forget that it was these hands and fingers that she would plunge into the sweet Jaws when we are strapped

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,848
Pennywise of treacle toffee wine gums or nut clusters or whatever

15
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,944
They were precious few health lower than those days I nobody

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Least of all mrs. Pratchett

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:56,832
Ever thought of using a little shovel the getting sweets out as they do today

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,184
The other thing we hated mrs. Pratchett for

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464
What time meanness

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,048
Unless you spend a whole Sixpence all-in-one go

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
She wouldn't get you a bag

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,192
Instead you got your sweets twisted up in a small piece of newspaper

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,032
Wichita waffle potable daily mirror's lying on the counter

24
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,408
So you can well understand that we had it in for mrs. Pratchett in a big way

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
But we didn't quite know what to do about it

26
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,832
Many schemes were put forward but none of them has any good

27
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
None of them that is

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,696
Until suddenly one memorable afternoon

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
We found the Deadmau5

30
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,888
My friends and I have come across a loose floorboard at the back of the classroom

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
And when we prize to help with the blade of a pocket knife

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
We discovered a big hollow space underneath

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
This we decided would be all secret hiding place for sweets another small Treasures such as conquerors and monkey

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Knudsen Birds eggs

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Every afternoon

36
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
When the last lesson was over

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
The five of us would wait until the classroom it emptied

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,720
Then we would lift up the floorboard and examine our secret hoard

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,536
Adding to it or taking something away

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
One day when we lifted up

41
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,680
We found a dead mouse lying among all Treasures

42
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
Exciting discovery

43
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,336
Plates to get out by its tail and waved it in front of our faces

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
What should we do with it he cried

45
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
It stinks someone sharted

46
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Window

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
Hold on a tick I said

48
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Don't throw it away

49
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Thwaites hasn't dated

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
They all looked at me

51
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
When writing about oneself

52
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
One must strive to be truthful

53
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Truth is more important than Mother's Day

54
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
I must tell you that

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,568
But it was I and I alone who had the idea for the Great and the daring Mouse plot

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,152
We all have our moments of Brilliance and Glory

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
And this was mine

58
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Why don't we I said

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
Slip it into one of Mrs pratchett's jars of sweets

60
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
Then when she puts a dirty hand in to grab a handful she grab a stinky dead mouse instead

61
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
The other four standard mean one.

62
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,912
Then as the sheer Genius of a plot began to sink in

63
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
They all started grinning

64
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
They slapped me on the back they cheered me and danced around the classroom will do it today they cried

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
We do it on the way home

66
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,712
You have the idea they said to me

67
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,552
So you can be the one to put the mouse in the jar

68
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
Thwaites handed me the mouse

69
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
I put it into my travel pocket

70
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
The five of us left the school

71
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
Cross the Village Green

72
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
And headed for the sweet shop

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Webull tremendously jazzed-up

74
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:53,984
We felt like a gang of desperadoes setting out to rob a train or blow up the Sheriff's Office

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
We will go pick those now

76
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
Mrs. Pratchett victim

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
She stood behind the counter

78
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:08,576
I have small malignant Pig eyes watched as suspiciously as we came forward

79
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
1 Chabot soccer please

80
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
Flight said to her holding out his penny

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
I kept to the rear of the group

82
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,887
And when I saw mrs. Pratchett Turner had to wait for a couple of seconds to fish of its sucker out of the box

83
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
I lifted the heavy glass lid of a Gobstopper jar

84
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Drop them off scene

85
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
Ben I replaced the lid asylumtale possible

86
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
My heart was thumping like mad

87
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
And my hands are cold sweaty

88
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
As soon as we were outside we broke into a rotten did you do it they shouted at me of course I did I say

89
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,487
Well done you they cried what a Super Show

90
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
I felt like a hero

91
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
I wasn't gyro

92
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
It was marvelous to be so popular

93
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
The flash of triumph over the Deadmau5 with carry forward to the next morning as we met again to walk to school

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,943
Let's go in and see if it's still in the job somebody said as we approached the Sweet Shop

95
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Tote

96
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Whiteside family

97
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
It's too dangerous

98
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
Who passed as though nothing has happened

99
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Has became level with a shop

100
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
We swore cardboard notice hanging on the door

101
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Closed

102
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
We stopped instead

103
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,167
Never known the Sweet Shop to be closed at this time in the morning

104
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Even on Sundays

105
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,031
What's happened we lost each other what's going on

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
We pressed all faces against the window

107
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
And look inside

108
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,943
Mrs. Pratchett was nowhere to be seen

109
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
Look I cried

110
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
Gobstopper jarkon it's not on the Shelf

111
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Is a gap what it used to be

112
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
It's on the floor someone said

113
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,535
It smashed to bits and cops everywhere

114
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Bears

115
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Someone else Shahid

116
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
We could see it all

117
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
The huge glass jar smash to Smithereens with a dead mouse lying in the wreckage and hundreds of men

118
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
Gobstoppers littering the floor

119
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,479
She got such a shock when she grabbed hold of a mouse but you dropped everything

120
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
Somebody was saying

121
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,855
Why didn't she sweep it all up and open the shop I asked

122
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Nobody answered me

123
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Oscar Wilde

124
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Quates brokensilenze

125
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,327
She must have got one heck of a shock he said

126
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Opposed

127
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
We all looked at him

128
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,751
Wondering what wisdom the great medical Authority was going to come out with next

129
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Well now

130
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Fights went on

131
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,199
When an old person like mrs. Pantry suddenly gets a very big shock

132
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
I suppose you know what happens next

133
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
What we said what happens

134
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
You off my father plate said

135
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
He'll tell you

136
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
You tell us we said

137
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
It gives her heart attack

138
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Waiting on

139
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
A heart stopped beating and she's dead in 5 seconds

140
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,239
Pramono to my old heart stop beating

141
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
White spongy the finger at me and said.

142
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
I'm afraid you've killed her

143
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Me I cried

144
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Why just me

145
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
It was your idea he said

146
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
And what's more you put a myosin

147
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
I want to something

148
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
I was a murderer

149
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Exactly that point we had the school bell ringing in the distance and we have to gallop the rest of the way so it's not.

150
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Late for prayers

151
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,055
The Headmaster is the only teacher at Randolph Cathedral School that I can remember

152
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
And for a reason you will soon discover

153
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
I can remember him very clearly indeed

154
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
His name

155
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
With mr. Coons

156
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,903
Mrcool not proceeded to mumble through the same old prayers we had everyday

157
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
But this morning when the lost our men have been spoken he did not turn to lead his group rapidly alcoholism

158
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
He remains standing before us

159
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
And it was clear

160
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
He had an announcement to make

161
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,591
The whole school is developing line up around the playground immediately he said

162
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,407
Little book behind and no talking

163
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
Mrcool a looking grim

164
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
Is Jaime pink face have taken on that dangerous skull which only appeared when he was extremely cross and

165
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Somebody was the high jump

166
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
I sent the small and frightened among the rows and rows of other boys

167
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,143
The Headmaster with his black gown draped over his shoulders

168
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
Would like a judge at a murder trial

169
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
Michaela

170
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
Thwaites whisper to me

171
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
I began to shiver

172
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
As we made our way out into the playground

173
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,807
My whole stomach began to feel as though it was slowly filling up with swirling water

174
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,135
I am only 8 years old I told myself

175
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
No little boy at 8 is that a mud at anyone

176
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
It's not possible

177
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,679
I have expected to see two policemen come bounding out of the school to grab me by the arms and put handcuffs on my wrist

178
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
A single door let out from the school Under the playground

179
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
Suddenly it swung open and threw it by the angel of death Strode mr. Coombs hugin Falcon his

180
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Tweed suit and black down

181
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,319

185
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
The relief was tremendous

186
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887

187
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
