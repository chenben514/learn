00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
Dating

00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,352
Typescript 9

4
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,144
Tom and Kathy

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:14,592
Kathy we last heard from you when you are about to meet Tom for the first time that's right it was

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Easier for me to take time off work so I booked a flight to Denver that's a long way to go for a date

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,136
I'd rather expensive to we share the cost of the flight Tom's a very generous man

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,232
Anybody he arranged to meet me at the airport and when was that

9
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,280
It was almost a year ago

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,352
I felt really nervous but I couldn't wait to meet Tom

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,400
Oh yes

12
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
I spotted him immediately

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,032
He look just like his photograph was it love at first sight

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm afraid not.

15
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,688
I couldn't have predicted what happened but something put me off in straightaway

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,248
I didn't even leave the airport

17
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,808
I just turned round and came straight back to Ireland

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,392
We haven't been in touch since that day

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,184
What was it that put you off

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,768
It's going to sound really stupid

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
But I hated it shoes
