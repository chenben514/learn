00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
Working hard

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
Mom I was wondering

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,488
Do you think you could lend me some money till the end of the month

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,424
Have you got yourself into debt again because if you have

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,984
Money

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
I mean you've got a good job Mom it's expensive living in Bristol

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
What you expect if you go out every night and buy expensive computers I haven't gotten

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,064
Computer

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,392
It's a PlayStation

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,488
I mean your sister never phone's up asking for money

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,120
You spent a fortune wedding

19
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,472
Well I'm not going to get married so you might as well give me the money no

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
What would Maggie say

21
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
Silly

22
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
Honesty Richard

25
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,296
You really must learn to budget look Mom if you can

26
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Just help me out this time I promise I'll try to be more careful in the future

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,304
Listen to it this time but this really is the last time

28
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,912
If you get yourself into trouble again you'll just have to sort it out yourself

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,240
Thanks Mom I'm doing this on one condition

00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
