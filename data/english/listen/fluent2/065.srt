00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Sissy

00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,840
What do you think

4
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
A good party

5
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,680
Places really important

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,704
It should be big enough

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
But not too big

8
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,496
Yes

9
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,568
He needs to be quite crowded to make an atmosphere

10
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,896
Oh I don't like it when you can't see who you're talkin

11
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
I mean soft lighting

12
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
I like it when there are some decorations to you know a few balloons and things just to make it special like a children's

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,952
Cool candles and things on the wall

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,304
What time does make a nice atmosphere but you have to be careful the house doesn't catch fire

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
What will you come get those candle holders

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,888
The most important

17
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
Thing is the food in

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Oh yes

19
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,496
Lots of drink and dinner food

00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,080
There's enough food source of food you think is good for

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
You can eat with your fingers I mean you don't want a place of washing up at the end of the policy

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
The most

23
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
Loud but not too loud

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Anderson music you can dance to

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
The best thing is to prepare party type

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
With all the best dance tracks

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
Then you don't have to worry about it

28
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
But what about people that's quite important

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680

00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:17,312
I need some party animal to get upset with don't think you need a mix of men and women

31
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,664

32
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
