Fried grasshoppers at Tasty to most people

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
Provided they don't know what they're eating

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,072
Feed crickets in parts of North America

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
And they taste just the same

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,496
I'm not sure I'd like to eat insects well you better not go to Indonesia then

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,312
Last time I was there I had a feast of insect

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,152
The main course was roasted cockroaches

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
What did that taste like

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,784
They're all the mortuary and crisp on the outside and then

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,624
Rich liquid on the inside which tastes quite sweet and fruity

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672
What other insects have you eaten

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
Well

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,608
Cinema said roasted dance instead of popcorn play what are they like

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
Sweet and crisp

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
Delicious actually

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Ingleside

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
Barbecued lizard in South America

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
But that was a bit disappointing was a bit Bland

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
Not particularly tasty

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
On the other hand iguana

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
Made a much more interesting dish

32
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,344
After 10 minutes boiling in very salty water they made a very tasty evening snack

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
A bit too salty for my taste but very good

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,744
I've heard that they grubs in Australia

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Kant believed that

36
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Is it true

37
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Yes

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,656
I've never eaten them roll but I have eaten them fried

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Little K

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Chewy

41
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,032
Crunchy on the outside but on the inside

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,592
I'm sorry I don't even want to think about it

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Can we change the subject

44
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,712
How about shark fin soup have you ever tried that

45
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Only once

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
In China

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
It's very expensive and takes ages to

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Prepare

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
But it's delicious

50
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
The Taste depends on how the chef prepare.

51
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,024
It was quite spicy I'm not particularly fishy

52
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Anyway

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
What about you

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,704
Have you ever eaten anything strange adventurous as you

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
And I've never been out of Europe

56
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
Probably the strangest I must say the most revolting thing I've ever eaten was in Scotland recently

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
You mean this is delicious

58
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,040
No it was deep fried Mars Bar

59
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
What

60
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
Like fish and chips

61
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
Mothballing tips that's right

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
Greasy and horribly sweet

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Disgusting
