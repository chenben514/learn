00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
1. Friends

3
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,840
Tapescript one

4
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,912
Interview with Jade Jagger

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,984
Could you tell us a little bit about yourself

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
Sure

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
First of all, Where were you born?

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,200
I was born in London, but I've got dual nationality because my mother's from Nicaragua.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Do you still live in London?

11
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,000
No,I'm living in Ibiza now. 

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,320
Oh, really? How long have you been there. 

14
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,696
Not long. I moved from London with my two daughters, Assisi and Amba, about 6 months ago.

16
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
Are you happy there?

17
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
Yeah, very happy.

18
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,304
We love the outdoor life.

20
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,680
Also, my mother is a Spanish speaker and I feel more comfortable in a Latin country.

21
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,984
Have you made any new friends

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,568
Yeah, I've made lots of new friends here. A few English,

24
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,500
but my two best friends are Argentinian and Spanish. 

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,432
What do you do for a living?

25
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
I'm a painter,

26
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,552
but I've recently started a jewelry business with a friend,

27
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,112
and that takes up most of my time.

28
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,000
I also do some modeling when I need the cash!

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,208
And what do you do in your free time?

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,816
Well, with a business and two young children I don't have much free time,

30
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
but I love reading and listening to music.

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
What sort of music do you like? 

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
All sorts: pop music and classical.

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,056
Do you ever listen to the Rolling Stones.

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
No, never, but don't tell my father.

35
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
How often do you see your parents?

36
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
Not very often.

37
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,552
My mother's in New York and and my father's often on tour.

38
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,392
But we all love big family get-togethers.

39
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
You're obviously travelled a lot. What's your favorite place in the world?

40
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,792
That's a difficult question because I've been to so many amazing places,

41
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
but I think Brazil is my favorite.

42
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
The children love it there too.

43
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
Finally, Can I ask one last question - 

45
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
who chose your name

46
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
I think my father chose it.

47
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,152
My mother wanted me to have a Spanish name.
