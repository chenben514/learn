1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
16

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,816
Review to

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,120
Typescript 55

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,472
So if we could turn to the origin of language

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,032
Do you know when we're on

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
Language originated

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:19,200
That's a difficult question to answer the answer is no one really knows

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
What we doing

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,296
Eastwind language was first written down

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,880
And that was about five and a half thousand years ago

11
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
About

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
The Sumerians who lived in Mesopotamia

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
The first people to write down their language

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
They use symbols called

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,400
Pictographs to represent everyday objects

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
Egyptian hieroglyphs

17
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,800
And the alphabet was developed around 3,500 years ago

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
By the Phoenicians

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,896
Who lived on the eastern coast of what is now Syria

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
Today there around 65

21
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,088
Interesting the one used in the Solomon Islands

22
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
As only 11 letters

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
Under the longest

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
I believe it's called 74

25
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,096
How many languages are there in the world today

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:13,216
Somewhere in the region of $4,000 will ever find out the exact

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
Which of these are the most spoken

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,616
Well Mandarin Chinese has about a billion speakers

29
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,688
English is next with about half billion speakers

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,016
And Hindi Spanish Russian behind

31
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,368
These five languages account for half of all the conversations in the world

32
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
Scientific truth Mandarin is the biggest line

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
I mean

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
The one with the most words

35
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
It's difficult to say

36
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
The latest thing

37
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888
English is actually the biggest

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
Largely due to the number of Technical and scientific

39
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
At least a million

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,384
Most native speakers only use about 10,000 was

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
1%

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
Only 10,000

43
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
And can you guess which of these

44
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
The most used words in English

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Maybe

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Be

47
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
According to recent research

48
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
Tens of thousands of hours of conversation to be

49
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
The most common word is

50
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Be

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
Will be we think is the most used but

52
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,224
What do you think about common noun in spoken English is

53
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
The most common noun maybe something like

54
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:39,744
Why did you just said it actually apparently it's

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,072
Sing

56
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,864
What about the origins of word

57
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
Where does English come from English which is about 500 years old

58
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Mainly romance and Germanic language

59
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,944
Greek and Arabic Kabuto provided English with many would that digital sugar

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Comes from Arabic

61
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
I'm surprisingly

62
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Alcohol

63
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
Fax medic Mini

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,904
Happy borrowed from other languages

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Example

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Did you know that coffee

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Come from Turkish

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Chest the game

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Where do you think ketchup as in tomato ketchup

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Comes from

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
I've no idea

72
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
America

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
It's from the Malay language

74
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
Traditional Malaysian suicide

75
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
How about shampoo

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
Sounds a bit Oriental to Me Maybe Japanese

77
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
It's actually a Hindi word

78
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
India

79
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
The list is endless

80
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
You mentioned India

81
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
Is another country with hundreds of languages

82
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Well

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
I don't know about hundred

84
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
I think Papua New Guinea is got the most

85
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
With 850 separately

86
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
India has gone.

87
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
The banknotes

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
I suppose they're the main line

89
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
Most people that speak at least two or three

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
And one

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Final question

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,696
Speak two languages fluently is difficult enough

93
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
But have you any idea what the highest number of languages spoken by one person is

94
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
That eat

95
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
What was

96
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
A Frenchman

97
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Complement

98
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
Bespoke

99
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
31 different languages

100
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
Will say thank you very much and

101
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
