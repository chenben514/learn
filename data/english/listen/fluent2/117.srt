00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,448
You look worried what's on your mind

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,336
Actually there is something I've been meaning to tell you if it's about last night

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:20,224
It really doesn't matter I should have said it

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880

My parents used to play The Rolling Stones to know you don't understand

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,488

Well you look very good for your age

00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104
