Interview Assets tell us about your financial success story. Interview Assets, well I've

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,120
run several businesses all of which failed except this one. After decades of blood, sweat

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,600
and tears, it has finally paid off. By leveraging a few shrewd partnerships, we were able to

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,280
buy out our competitors and expand our operations. Interview Assets, oh that's impressive. What

00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:35,280
do you think contributed to your success? So what was part of your success? What helped? Interview

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,000
Assets, I believe it's important to always be open to new ideas and to try out new strategies.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,200
Also, being willing to step down and delegate responsibilities to others has been critical

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,520
in allowing me to focus on the bigger picture. Interview Assets, those are great insights. What

00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,360
advice would you give to someone who is just starting out in the business world? Interview

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,960
Assets, my advice would be to never give up and always stay focused on your goals. Take

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,920
calculated risks and be open to new opportunities.
