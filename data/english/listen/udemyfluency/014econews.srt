00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Good evening and welcome to the economy in 60 seconds.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,540
Our top starry tonight, despite sawing inflation, the stock market seems to have leveled off

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,500
after weeks of volatility.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,840
Experts are cautiously optimistic that stocks will trend upwards.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,560
As investors way up their options, consumers are still facing rising prices and may have

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,300
to fork out more money for essential goods for the rest of the year.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,860
In addition, supply chain issues persist as cargo ships continue to poil up in long

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,100
queues at their ports.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,100
As long as ships continue to be towed up in ports, the economy will continue to suffer

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,060
disruptions and shortages of certain goods.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,060
Such supply constraints are exacerbating the situation, making it difficult for businesses

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,140
to meet consumer demand.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,300
Our authorities are working to oyer out these problems, but it will take some time to

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,860
get everything back on track.
