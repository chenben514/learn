1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hey, Jude, do you have a moment to talk about setting up a meeting?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,560
Jude says, sure, what's up?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,520
Dominic says, we need to brainstorm the way forward regarding our latest client.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,000
Could sometime this week work for you?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Jude says, let me pull up my calendar quickly.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,320
Damn, I'm all blocked up this week, but I can set aside sometime next week.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,800
How long do you reckon we'd need?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,040
Dominic says, given the lack of resources assigned to the project, at least two hours.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,480
And then Jude says, cool, I'm sure I can squeeze in a two hour gap next week Wednesday.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,440
Do you think this a chance will run over?

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,200
And Dominic says, great, let me pencil in the Wednesday slot.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,760
I think we should be able to get through everything.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,480
If anything changes last minute, I'll give you a heads up ASAP.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,000
See you next week.
