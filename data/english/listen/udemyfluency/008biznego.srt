1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
So it's Nikolai talking to Klaus.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,920
So Nikolai says, I'm glad we could meet today

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,960
to discuss the potential cooperation.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,280
Let's run through the contract details.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,400
Let's run through the contract details.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Klaus says likewise, that means he's also happy to meet.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,360
We'll need to go over a few details

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,040
to make sure this is a viable partnership from our end.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,920
We're not willing to risk our finances on a deal

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,600
that isn't well thought out, okay?

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,280
Nikolai says, of course, we've put together a proposal

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,480
that we think is fair and realistic.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,280
We're willing to put up some initial seed capital

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,720
to help get the projects off the ground,

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,760
but we'll need your company to take over

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,080
the implementation side, okay?

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,920
Klaus says, looking at these figures,

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,800
I will have to confirm with the executive,

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,320
but because I'm not authorized to sign off on this.
