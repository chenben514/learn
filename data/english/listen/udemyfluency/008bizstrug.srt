00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Welcome everyone, I wish we were all meeting here under more positive circumstances.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,680
As you all know, our business has been struggling to survive in the current economic downturn.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,240
We're barely scraping by each month and unless we turn things around soon, it will become

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,920
more and more difficult to get by.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,400
We've had to dip into our savings to cover our expenses and there have been times where

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,840
we've had to run up some debt to keep us going.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,440
The path ahead is a difficult one, but I'm proud to lead you all.
