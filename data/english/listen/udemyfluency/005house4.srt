00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Rita and Lee are talking to each other. So Rita says,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
so how's everything been? Did you end up moving forward with the house purchase?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,920
And Lee says, yes, we did. We signed the paperwork last week and the previous owners are moving out

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,880
end of the month. Assuming we can cram everything into the moving truck in one go,

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
we're aiming to have moved in by the end of next month.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,880
Rita says,

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,400
they're so exciting. We would have taken up that opportunity too. The price was almost too good

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,000
to be true. Are you still planning to put up a treehouse in the garden? And Lee says,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,360
oh for sure, we've got all sorts of things planned out already. The garden needs some tidying up,

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,160
but we'll be okay. Rita says, nice. If you could build onto the side of the garage, you could fit

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,240
both cars inside too. And Lee says, yep, that's on the wish list as well. We're also thinking of

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,640
doing up one side of the garage as a playroom for the kids, but we'll see. Anyway, I've got a run.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,760
It was nice bumping into you. Chapsun.
