1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
So, what's the new business idea you've come up with?

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,760
We want to create an online platform where people can compare different local gyms.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,640
That sounds like a great idea.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,840
We should start drawing up a plan and mapping up the details.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,800
Yes, but before we do that, we need to go over the competition and make sure we're not

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,040
duplicating what's already up there.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,040
That's a good point.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,680
We don't want to run into any legal issues down the road.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Right, we need to do our due diligence and see if there are any potential roadblocks

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,080
we need to get around before moving forward.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Absolutely.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,800
And once we have a solid plan, we can act on it and start building our platform.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,040
But we need to be open to feedback and make adjustments as necessary to make sure that

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,280
our business is successful.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Agreed.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
It's important to be flexible and adapt to any changes in the market.
