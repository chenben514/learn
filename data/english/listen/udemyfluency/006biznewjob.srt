Hi, Mary. How's your first month and the new job being? Are you staying on top of things?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, I've been keeping up with everything, but unexpected issues did arise. In my previous job,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I learned that it is important to be able to deal with them quickly, to avoid any negative impacts on the business,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
or falling behind at work.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I couldn't agree more. It's good to know that we can count on each other to manage these situations.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Definitely, and if you ever have any concerns, be sure to bring them up.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We can work together to address any issues as soon as possible.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's a great point. Speaking of concerns, we need to find a way to cut back in expenses. Any ideas?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, I think we should review our budget and identify any unnecessary expenses.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
By cutting back on these expenses, we can keep costs under control and improve the bottom line.
