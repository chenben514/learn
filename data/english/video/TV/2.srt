00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:08.579
So based on the popularity of our first lesson with Harry Potter and so many of you asking us for another one

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.450
We thought we would bring you a new lesson with a famous scene from this delightful movie in this scene

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.000
We see the kids learning one of their first spells as we explained in the other lesson

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.699
We made on Harry Potter a spell is a group of words used as a magical charm or incantation

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.270
In the Wizarding World, they use wands to cast spells that is to cause them to take effect

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.540
All right. Let's watch the first part of the scene where Professor Flitwick explains the spell

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.860
One of the Wizards most rudimentary skills is an imitation

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.610
The ability to make objects fly

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.000
You will have your feathers good

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.989
Now what?

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.699
Don't forget the nice wrist

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.978
Movement, we've been practicing the swish ad flick

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
everyone

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.799
Enunciate Wingardium Leviosa off you go then

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.839
One of the Wizards most rudimentary skills is an imitation or the ability to make objects

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.680
fly

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.739
Levitation is the action of rising and floating in the air without any physical support

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.539
This word is typically associated with supposed magical or super powers

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.019
so when Superman or a Dragonball Z character flies

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.729
We could also say they are levitating the verb to levitate can refer to causing something to levitate or levitating yourself

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.369
Example some people actually believe that if you meditate enough you can achieve the ability to levitate

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.559
one of the Wizards most rudimentary skills is an invitation now the adjective rudimentary it means the same as

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.119
basic, so if something such as a skill as considered rudimentary

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.229
It relates to the beginning or initial phase of learning. That is it is a basic skill not an advanced one

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.890
Example she only had a rudimentary formal education that you will have your feathers

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.139
Professor Flitwick will now try and teach the students how to levitate an object by magic for practice

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.479
They're going to try the spell on feathers

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.920
now well

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.720
Don't forget the nice wrist

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.269
Movement we've been practicing the wrist is the part of the body between the hand and the arm where you'd normally wear a watch

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.470
Don't forget the nice wrist

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.399
Movement, we've been practicing the swish

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.269
Everyone

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.499
In the Wizarding World to cast a spell with your wand also requires you to make a specific

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.369
movement of the wrist while holding the wand he describes this movement as the swish and flick if

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.739
Something swishes or you swish it?

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.439
It moves through the air making a soft sound this refers to the first part of the movement

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.309
Which is about making a long soft swishing movement with the wand

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.129
The second part is about flicking the wand if something flicks or you flick it it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.449
moves and hit something or simply stops with a short sudden movement if

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.840
You flicked someone or something. It could be painful as we see when Monica and Rachel fight here

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.390
Did you just flick me? Okay, well you wouldn't let me finish and I was

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.190

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.040
Movement, we've been practicing by the way. Did you notice how Flitwick pronounces the word wrist here? Don't forget the nice wrist

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.519
Movement, how about the word rudimentary?

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.969
one of the Wizards most rudimentary skills

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.400
You probably noticed this sounds very

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.970
Different from the are sounds heard in the American accent and even different from the more common standard British accent

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.669
Let's hear it again. Don't forget the nice wrist

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.419
Movement, you just heard the distinctive rolling R

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.288
That is common to the Scottish accent interestingly enough

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.320
It sounds very similar to the rolling are found in Spanish Portuguese and Italian languages

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.059
Something you'd like to say there are several things. I would like to say

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.840
We never use

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.470
Transfiguration as a punishment surely Dumbledore told you that

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.750
Might have mentioned it, but you will do well to remember it. I

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.719
Thought if you find it now, I could can't only a parent or a guardian consign since I am neither it would be inappropriate

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.039
What do you think of all the different accents that can be heard in the Harry Potter movies do you find any particular character?

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.639
Who you think is harder to understand join the discussion in the comments below

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.440
the swish ad pick everyone

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.610
Good

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.769
Enunciate Wingardium, Leviosa

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.759
To enunciate it's a say or pronounce words fully and clearly for example

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.970
I really try to enunciate much more when I teach English than when I speak with American friends in

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.269
This case Professor Flitwick is referring to making a clear sound and correctly pronouncing the spell

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.050
Don't yet Wingardium Leviosa?

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.679
Off you go then off you go

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.879
Is a British English idiomatic expression with two slightly different?

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.040
applications in this case

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.540
it was used as to tell somebody that they can now start doing something such as a

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:50.189
Presentation or an activity in class as seen in the scene Flitwick is allowing his students to start practicing

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.979
However, this expression is more commonly used to let somebody know that they can now leave

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.869
Is there something you wish to tell me?

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.620
No, sir

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.199
Very well then off you go

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:16.299
Highly recommend reacquaint yourself with the chapter on antidotes

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:22.659
I'll tell you more about bazaars in our next class right off you go. Please forget your rat tail

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.470
Wingardium Leviosa

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.990
Stop stop stop

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.990
You're going to take someone's eye out

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.230
Besides you're saying it wrong. It's

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.689
Leviosa, not Leviosa, you do it then if you're so clever

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.720
Wingardium Leviosa

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:13.570
Oh well done. See here everyone. Miss Granger has done it. Splendid

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.950
Guardian Leviosa

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.890
Stop stop stop

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.989
You're going to take someone's eye out.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:33.099
Even though Hermione is probably jokingly exaggerating here when she says that Ron is going to take someone's eye out

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.979
she means that he's been too careless or

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.699
irresponsible with this movement because it seems to be so

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.739
Uncontrolled and aggressive that he will end up causing an accident and hurting somebody's eye

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.169
Example, I don't want you kids playing with fireworks. You could lose a finger or take somebody's eye out

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.329
Hey, so every week. We hope learners like you understand fast speaking natives without getting lost without reason the jokes and without subtitles

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.999

So if you want to improve your fluency just like Huma then I highly recommend you hit that subscribe button and the bell down below

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.579
To not miss a single one of our new lessons

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.130
You're going to take someone's on it besides you're saying it wrong

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.390
It's Navy Oh saw not Navy Oh song

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.469
Besides means the same as also or in addition

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:31.150
It is used to add new information like an argument to what has already been said

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.520
Beyond your reach

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:44.560
Sorry, no way you had matter you upside besides you don't even know how to fly

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.759
I'll be forever grateful for this

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.110
To both of you. I want to go with you one day perhaps

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:59.559
Sometime my life will be too unpredictable

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:02.379
and besides

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:06.399
He'll meant to be here in this case Hermione

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:13.839
First said that he was doing the wrong movement by being too aggressive with it. Then she added that he was also saying it wrong

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:18.999
You're going to take someone's Island besides you're saying it wrong

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:20.259
by the way

00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:23.558
be careful not to confuse it with the word beside which is a

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:28.089
Preposition that is used to indicate being by the side of or next to something

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.170
Okay

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.079
Now you marry but never known your family

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.650
You see them

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.490
Standing beside you

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.909
Who sang wrong? It's never OSA not live you saw

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:17.240
You do it then if you're so clever to be clever is to have the ability to quickly understand

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.430
Elaborate or apply ideas more simply put to be clever is to be intelligent

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.099
Ron is saying to Hermione that if she thinks she is so smart telling him that he is doing it all wrong

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.409
She should try doing the spell herself

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.170
The one does it truely answer to me

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:13.000
Hi honey, I'm clever but not clever enough besides. We've got a

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.510
Hoax me we know

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.979
We'll show you a quicker way you do it then if you're so clever

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:30.550
As an informal idiomatic expression go on is used to encourage somebody to say or do something

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.190
Talk about tongues right go on

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.409
Phones, right Harry, you're gonna need your strength today. I'm not hungry

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.549
Come on now, you'll be late

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.830
trees leaving gone

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:52.449
Come on, we're saying wrong. It's never OSA not Liv you saw

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.560
Wingardium Leviosa

00:12:56.779 --> 00:12:59.379
Although Wingardium Leviosa are made-up words

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:06.520
We can still analyze this humorous explanation that Hermione gave Ron from a phonetic point of view and learn a lot from it

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.329
She explained that when saying when Guardian Leviosa, you should not pronounce Leviosa with an open a sound at the end

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.580
But rather with a schwa sound

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.390
So instead of saying Leviosa, you should say

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.930
Musa

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.690
This is really useful to practice because the schwa sound is the most common sound in English

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:32.530
So in order to have clear correct pronunciation, it is important that you master it. So, let's practice it with Hermione

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.530
in Guardium Musa

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.820
Wingardium Leviosa

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.770
Oh

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.390
well

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.080
See here, everyone this great just done it

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.739
splendid splendid means excellent fantastic or very impressive example

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:10.689
We had a splendid holiday together. It can be used by itself. Just as Flitwick did to express great admiration for something or somebody

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.010
In the old days. I used to throw together the occasion or supper party

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.920
next door to

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.350
Our considers an honor sir

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.680
You'd be welcome to Granger

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.740
I'd be the lightest that blended

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.790
All right

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.599
So now it is time for you to test everything that you learned today by watching the full scene

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.679
without subtitles and to further challenge you we will be actually

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:41.169
Pausing at the scene at different moments to ask you some different quiz questions, and hey

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.050
We definitely want to make more lessons like this one with Harry Potter

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.610
So if you enjoyed it

Scene you would like us to do just write it down in the comments below and maybe we'll do it

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.569
Alright, so now it's time to roll the test

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.509
One of the Wizards most rudimentary skills is

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:05.680
limitation

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.489
The ability to make objects fly

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.878
You will have your feathers good

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:13.870
now well

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.610
Don't forget the nice wrist

Movement, we've been practicing the swish add flick

00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:22.379
everyone

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.219

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.830

Stop stop stop. You're going to take someone's eye out besides you're saying it wrong

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.899
It's Leviosa not live you saw you do it then if you're so clever

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:26.689
Don't bore Olivia Wingardium Leviosa

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.770
