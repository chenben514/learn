00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Yo, what's up I'm Ethan your real-life
English fluency coach and as you

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
probably know if you follow our channel
we are all about helping you to find

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.160
ways to make understanding English fun
with TV series.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.080
So that said, all the time

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.760
English learners from around the world
just like you asked me "what is the best

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880
TV series to learn English with?"

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.410
Well as you probably know 
as the hosts of this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.849
channel I absolutely love watching TV
series and this probably makes me a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.860
little bit of an expert.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.780
Now, I know this might 
sound like a simple question but

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
it's actually quite complex because
first of all it depends on a variety of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.719
factors such as what is your current
level, what are your personal preferences

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.180
what are your English learning goals and
so on.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.770
And in addition to this there are

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.910
tons of series out there to choose from
and they're making new ones all the time.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.559
So that said I still really want to help
you to answer this question and so I

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.400
have made a list of the best series to
learn English with in 2020.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.480
Now these are all series that I've actually personally
watched over the last year and I've

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.260
tried to kind of mix them up to give you
a variety so that no matter where you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.210
are or what your English learning goals
are be it learning English for business,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.900
learning English for law, learning
English for science or just learning

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.170
English to be able to have an everyday
conversation you are bound to find

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.799
something that you're going to love in
this list and of course since I've

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.670
watched all of these personally over the last
year I know that they are all going to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.420
be super fun and entertaining for you.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.290

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.440
All right so now let's take a look at the best 
series to learn English with in 2020.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.720
Number 10

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.360
Stranger Things.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.720
Something is coming, something
hungry for blood.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.920
What is it?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.940
The Demogorgon.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.120
We're in deep shit.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.060
Later

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.060
See you tomorrow.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.800
-Good night, ladies.
-Kiss your mum night for me.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.060
Now guys this
one is super entertaining, it's fun and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.280
it is definitely a must watch that you
can catch on Netflix.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.440
Now the reason that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.459
I love this one is because it's super
unique in that it kind of it's a

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.690
nostalgia of the 80s first of all, you
know I was born in the 80s I grew up

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.620
with a lot of the pop culture of that
era so if you're similar that you grew

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.160
up with these things you're definitely
going to love that aspect of it.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.380
But even if you didn't, it's got a fresh
young cast and one of the things that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.870
makes it really great is that you're
kind of waiting for monsters to pop out

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.420
so it's kind of a thriller and then at
the same time it blends in elements of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.290
comedy so I think this kind of
combination kind of keeps you

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.500
entertained throughout the entire first
season.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.959
Now last year the season 3 came

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.329
out and frankly I wasn't even sure if I
was going to watch it because season 2

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.840
was definitely disappointing it didn't
really deliver on everything that we

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.459
loved about season 1 but eventually I
decided to give it a try and watch

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.740
season 3 and it did not disappoint.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.390
It brought back everything that we loved

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.310
about season 1 while also bringing new
villains and a whole new plot so it goes

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.860
without saying that I'm definitely
looking forward to watching season 4 and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.500
I highly recommend that you check out
this series.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.000
Number 9.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.260
Rick and Morty

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.140
Now, are you ready to laugh I mean like
really laugh so hard that your ribs hurt?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.440
Well Rick and Morty is a perfect show
for this.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.209
If you enjoy animated series

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.019
this one is definitely different than
what you might be accustomed to with the

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.300
likes of SpongeBob SquarePants or The
Simpsons.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.750
Now what this series does

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.329
because it takes very complex scientific
theories or philosophy and kind of

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.889
explains it in a very accessible way but
what makes Rick and Morty unique is

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.419
definitely the characters that we have
here the old man Rick who is kind of a

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.600
crazy insane scientist who doesn't
really care what anyone thinks of him

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.520
and Morty who is a timid young boy who
just loves helping out his grandfather.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.030
Now this is fantastic for your English
because you will learn idioms and

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.990
expressions, vocabulary the natives use
in everyday life while at the same time

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.479
having the opportunity to learn a lot of
vocabulary that is specific to science.

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.300
So in conclusion you're both equally
mercurial overly sensitive clingy

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.150
hysterical birdbrain humonculon and I
honestly can't even tell the two of you

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.300
apart half the time because I don't go
by height or age,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.180
I go by amount of pain in my ass,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.500
which makes you both identical.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.480
However, I should warn you 
that this series is not for everyone.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.740
The humor in it can be dark 
and sometimes even

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.610
offensive but if you want to get a taste
of what this series is all about then

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.430
you can check out this fun lesson that
we made with it by clicking up at the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.860
top right of the screen.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.860
Number eight.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.660
Friends

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.440
Now if you've been following us then you
know this is one of our favorite series.

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.550
Now I know that you're probably asking
yourself "what the heck is Friends, such

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.740
an old series from the 90s, doing on a
top ten list for 2020?"

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.260
Well the reason that I include 
this one is that I actually

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.360
rewatched the whole ten seasons last

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.699
year in 2019 and I have to tell you I
laughed a ton and I fell in love all

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.550
over again with all of the characters
and their stories.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.420
It definitely has not lost any of its
relevance.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.980
Check out what Selena Gomez 
recently said about it:

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.380
You know what
makes me so happy is that I would watch

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.197
it on channel 33 at 10:30 every night on
Thursday with my mom.

00:05:58.197 --> 00:05:59.440
-Yes 
-And I cried

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.780
when the whole season was over but what
made me so happy is like now now like

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.130
people my age and everyone else is just
obsessed and it just makes me so happy

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.780
for you and for the show because
it's iconic.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.640
Oh god I love you.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.940
And other fans that you might 
know about include Taylor Swift.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.840
I watch endless Friends marathons for comfort.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.920
Harry Styles,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.280
First question is:
"Sing your favorite TV show theme tune".

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.780
What should we do?

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.920
"So noone told you life was gonna be this way"

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.720
"Your job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's D.O.A"

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.760
And the lead singer of the popular k-pop
band, BTS.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.620
How did you teach yourself English?

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.740
Um actually my English teacher
was a sitcom, Friends,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.100
Oh you watched Friends!

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.720
Yes.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.760
So was it mainly just phrases then?

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.260
Or you just learned everything?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.340
Um, I think you know back in the days like
when I was like 15, like 14 it was quite

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.220
like a syndrome for all the Korean
parents to make their kids watch the Friends.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.340
-Really?
-So, yeah.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.860
For...I thought I was kind 
of like a victim at that time

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.600
but well right now I'm the lucky one 
so like thanks my mother she

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.160
she bought that all the other seasons
for DVDs, it got 10 DVDs, right?

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.390
Right.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.190
So about me, and so firstly I watched
with the Korean subtitle and the next

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.120
time I watched with the English subtitle
and then i just removed it.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.340
That's very impressive and Friends would be very
happy that you learned

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.880
Thank you!

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.300
And there's probably no series out there that is
better for learning English.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.380
In fact, various academic studies have actually
shown that this is probably the best

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.160
series that has ever been made for
learning English.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.480
Now this has to do with

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.500
kind of the storyline, you know friends
spending a lot of time sitting around in

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.240
a cafe speaking about life's everyday
problems but it also just has to do with

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.860
this having such a huge influence on the
english as it's spoken today.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.480
So if you would love to learn English with Friends
and have a ton of fun doing it well

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.060
there's no better way than with our

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.640
Number seven: Succession.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.360
Everything I've done in my life

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.640
I've done for my children I know I've
made mistakes but I've always tried to

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.340
do the best final because I love them.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.810
Maybe you thought about the possibility

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.800
that your children are actually scared
of you?

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.110
Oh fuck off!

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.339
Succession tells the story of a not so
typical family called the Roy's let's

00:09:04.339 --> 00:09:06.300
see exactly why.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.760
This is my vision, I take
over, you two under me.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.400
Under you.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.300
Let me think about it?

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.460
-Of course.
-I thought about it, fuck you.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.940
This family's broken and that has consequences.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.200
Kick out the old
man, him with the new guard.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.172
Where've you been?

00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:23.840
I was meeting about a prospective job.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.220
With your father's enemy?

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.460
Disagreeing with dad is not treason.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.240
You want this enough to
go to war with your family.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.040
Now, the reason that this series is on the list is
not only because it's super entertaining

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.850
but I recommend it for you because it is
great for learning business English

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.329
let's take a look at an example of some
of the typical sort of vocabulary that

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:45.380
you'll learn for business, be careful
because the series does include a lot of

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.519
vulgar language which is a part of
real-life English but if you prefer not

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.840
to see that then you might want to skip
over this example.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.140
Yeah I'll take it

00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:00.459
so all they need is adults in the room
accounting team, analytics team and

00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:06.170
investment we burned 50 million for a
few years we, we make it the best thing

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.080
in the world.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.380
Oh is that all?

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.940
But you always say "got a burn to turn".

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.500
Well, that's what's your read.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.760
And you know
it's interesting dad because I hear

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.290
everything he's saying and it actually
it almost sounds like a good pitch but I

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.760
call bullshit I spent some time down
there and I'm just not seeing it I don't

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.829
know exactly what they're doing but
they're fakes

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:33.470
fucking beehives almond milk and take
another week on that report, Matilda it

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.440
smells wrong and they're hiding shit.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.300
Oh.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.730
Now this series is a drama with a little

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:46.480
bit of comedy and it has won a bunch of
awards such as the Golden Globe for Best Drama.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.820
You can check out succession on
HBO.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.720
Number six: The Crown.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.820
We're ready for you, your Majesty.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.600
Three, two, one.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.840
This is Jubilee day, this
is a day of grueling as the Queen's

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.740
coronation 25 years ago.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.070
Now with
this one let's head over to England

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.140
because this series is perfect for
learners of British English now it's all

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.580
about the history of Queen Elizabeth the
second, the current Queen of England and

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.940
the Royal Family as she came to power.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.530
Now the reason we include it in this list

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.670
is because it uses a classic sort of
British English called received

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.600
pronunciation, which is likely what you
need to learn if you're learning British English.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.060
If that man wins, he'll want us out.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.720
This is no longer peacetime

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.639
This country was still great when I came
to the throne, all that's happened on my

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.900
watch is the place is falling apart.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.550
You cannot flinch any falling apart if

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:03.800
we say it is, that's the thing about the
monarchy we paper over the cracks.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.660
Now if you enjoyed this series and the language
that you can learn in it then you might

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.780
also want to check out Downton Abbey.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.615
Number five: Suits.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.400
Why don't we go out and celebrate?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.620
We're all on the same boat
now.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.600
I'm taking full control as Managing partner.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.480
Are you serious?

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.080
From now on it's are you serious 
ma'am, have you got that, pretty boy?

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.980
What you said about us
working together.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.800
I appreciate it.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.620
-Thanks, Robin. 
-Oh you welcome, Batman.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.440
Now coming from The Crown 
in England you

00:12:31.449 --> 00:12:36.430
might have heard of Megan Markle, who
married recently into the royal family

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.720
now she's one of the main actresses in
this next series.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.860
Mike Ross?

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.760
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane, I'll be giving your
orientation.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.440
Wow, you're pretty.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.000
Now Suits just had its final season

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.019
which is great because it 
means that you can binge on

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:57.790
the entire series at once. it is
absolutely fantastic for anyone that

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.020
needs to learn legal vocabulary let's
take a look at some examples.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.520
Celebratory drinks with the associates?

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.580
Yep.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.060
You know what? You can 
save the disappointment

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:07.160
Harvey I know what I did.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.120
Do you? because what I saw 
is that you backed off.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.640
It was a fake trial, all right? I weighed the
pros and the cons and I decided it

00:13:14.649 --> 00:13:16.760
wasn't worth hurting someone for the
result.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.819
The result is you just told every

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.440
partner in this firm including myself
that you have a weak stomach.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.800
You don't have what it takes.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.620
Now even if you're
not a lawyer and don't need to learn

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.569
legal vocabulary this show is absolutely
fantastic because it mixes comedy and

00:13:31.569 --> 00:13:35.980
drama and each episode tends to cover a
different case that will keep you on the

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.620
edge of your seat.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.240
Now if you've already
seen suits or after you finish it you

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.750
want some more legal vocabulary another
one that I really enjoyed that you could

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.320
check out is How to Get Away with Murder.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.399
I will not be teaching you how to study

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:52.850
the law or theorize about it,
but rather how to practice it in a

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.660
courtroom like a real lawyer.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.220
Now this one is a little bit corny but

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.260
is also super entertaining and
suspenseful, about a famous lawyer and

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.833
her legal students at the university
that she teaches out.

00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:07.880
You can check out

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.120
both Suits and How to Get Away with
Murder on Netflix

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.940
Number four: Killing Eve.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.940
Why are you and Vilanelle so
 interested in each other?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.080
She wants me to know when
she's killed someone.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.340
She's behind that door!

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.040
Oh my God, I absolutely love this one, guys.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.560
It's definitely one of my favorite ones that

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.160
I have discovered over the last couple
of years.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.160
Now this is another one with a

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.780
really strange but super fascinating
theme.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.600
Gosh, Killing Eve is...

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.740
It's a psychological drama, thriller and it
really focuses on this relationship

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.640
between these two women
I played Eve Polastri at this at

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:55.160
this early points works, for MI-5 and is
obsessed with a serial killer it's an

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.200
assassin's and then becomes obsessed
with this one assassin killer named

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.750
Villanelle play by Jodi Comer and we
just enter into this kind of... at

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.960
first I would say cat-and-mouse kind of
relationship

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.900
but by the end I think it's like cat and cat.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.140
Now one of the really
interesting things about this series is

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.310
that both of the main characters are
women in two roles that we typically see

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.220
played by men.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.840
Now for language learners
such as myself in English Learner like

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.190
you you're absolutely going to love this
series because of the mix of accents

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.940
first of all we see one of the main
characters has an American accent but a

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.480
lot of the series takes place in England
so we see a lot of British accents and

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.850
then the other main character is Russian
and she tends to speak English with a

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:50.380
Russian accent but she is also a master
of different accents and different languages.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.840
Jody, um, as Villanelle speaks many

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:58.160
languages I mean the girl has a
remarkable ear she's so talented and so

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.280
she's speaking many languages and and
many accents but her own accent well...

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.240
-Alright 
-I leave you all to...

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.300
-I'll be surprised. 
-Yes you will.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.400
As each episode came

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:12.200
through I was like "oh! Russian, German"
like they all yeah they kept going.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.480
-Wow!
-What's your favorite one to do on the show?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.760
Um, I really enjoyed doing the Italian purely

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.200
because that was the one I found easiest
to do, French is really hard.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.960
So it's really impressive to see her doing all
these different accents and it is

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.740
definitely someone that you can try to
emulate.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.380
Suncream heiress from Sydney

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.220
-I'm Billy. 
-Hi Billy.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.400
and I'm an addict.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.420
My name is Natalie this 
is Fanny we work with Frank.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:50.160
Excuse me, sir. I'm so sorry to
bother you but are you gonna graduate soon?

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.800
-Hablas español?
-Sí.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.080
-Deutsche?
-Ja.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.160
-Mandarin?

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.160
Number three: His Dark Materials.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.960
I set out for the North some twelve months ago,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.640
and this is the first of the discoveries
I made.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.140
A myriad of worlds,

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.400
Of which the Magisterium controls only one.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.920
For centuries they have been trying
 to keep us where they want us.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.080
on our knees.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.620
You promised the Magisterium you'd control Asriel.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.320
Then we'll need to take the 
matter into our own hands.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.420
Lyra, there's a great 
change coming that will threaten us all.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.460
I'm going to give you something.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.420
What does it do?

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.160
It has a part to play in all this.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.720
-And a major one.
-Wait!

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.680
Tell me where the alethiometer is.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.580
Or I will destroy all of this.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.240
I actually just recently watched season
one of this one I absolutely loved the

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.070
book trilogy by Philip Pullman, His Dark
Materials and I was thrilled when I

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.940
heard HBO was making a series with this.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.030
I'll tell you what guys this one

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:02.169
exceeded my expectations it is so much
better than I thought that it would be

00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:07.780
in His Dark Materials we see things like
talking bears, airships, portals to other

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:13.080
worlds and war and it's all from the
perspective of a little girl named Lyra.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.080
Now His Dark Materials is absolutely
exciting, you're always going to be

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.720
asking yourself what is coming next and
wanting more at the end of every episode

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.840
so even if you have not read the books I
highly recommend that you check this one

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.720
out on HBO.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.520
Number 2: Handmaid's Tale.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.880
I was asleep before that's how we let it happen.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.100
When they slaughtered Congress we
didn't wake up, when they blame

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.320
terrorists and suspended the
Constitution we didn't wake up then either.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.200
Now I'm awake.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.200
Now guys this one is really impactful the

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.260
reason that it is so good is because
what of a strange premise it is.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.559
However it also seems like it's kind of
realistic for something that could

00:18:55.559 --> 00:19:00.780
happen in the future, it takes place in
the United States in at least what was

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.160
the United States and it's kind of the
world that we know has gone to hell that

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.120
means that everything has gone really
bad.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.960
In Margaret Atwood's near-future

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.059
novel The Handmaid's Tale a Christian
fundamentalist regime called the

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:19.800
Republic of Gilead has staged a military
coup and established a theocratic

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.460
government in the United States.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.080
The regime theoretically restricts everyone

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:30.300
but in practice a few men have
structured Gilead so they have all the

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.120
power, especially over women.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.160
Now if you're like me this one will probably have

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.700
you really emotional sometimes feeling

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.460
really angry even at what's happening in
the series which I think if a series can

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.360
do that that means it's absolutely
fantastic.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.480
So I highly recommend you

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.710
check this one out on Hulu and I hope
you enjoy it a lot now let's move on to

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.900
number one.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.600
Can I get a drumroll please?

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.500
Number one is...

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.480
The Morning Show.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.680
8 seconds to you.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.020
Queue her.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.960
Good morning, I'm bringing you
some sad and upsetting news and while I

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.520
don't know the details of the
allegations...

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.481
She's throwing me under the bus.

00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:14.870
Mitch Kessler my co-host and partner of

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.300
15 years was fired today.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:26.900
So this series from the new streaming
platform Apple TV + features

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.420
Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve
Carell so already with this tremendous

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.440
cast we can expect a really fantastic
series.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.420
Now one of the reasons that this

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:42.420
series is so fantastic is that it is
taking a look at a very relevant issue today.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.420
I play a character named Mitch
Kessler he's a morning personality who

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.800
is accused of sexual misconduct.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.310
The show is about that that's sort of the

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.570
catalyst for what happens it's not
really about my character it's about how

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.060
it impacts this show and the people
within it.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.990
Yep, and and cover-ups and and

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.880
how supposedly that people higher up
know when things are happening.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.380
Yeah.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.620
And don't really do anything about it.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.470
Yeah web of lies there's a lot I mean

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.220
it's it's ten episodes I thought it was
very well written.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.200
Boy it's really really good.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.640
Now if you work in the world of
news or journalism you're going to find

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.010
the vocabulary that you learn in this
series really useful but even if you

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.670
don't you definitely should check it out
because this is a drama that is full of

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:33.100
twists and turns that's going to leave
you wanting to see what happens next.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.940
So a great place to start if you want to
check this one out is to watch a recent

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.660
popular lesson that we made featuring
this series by clicking up at the top or

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.180
down description below.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.250
So those are the
10 best series of 2020 for learning

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.090
English now I've given you all these
great series to learn with today but you

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.840
might be asking yourself how can I kind
of actively learn English with these on

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.440
my own and not just be like sitting on
the couch and using them purely for

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.840
entertainment?
Now we make this really easy on this

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.200
channel so you should definitely
subscribe so any of these that we

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.670
haven't made lessons with you can see
them in the future but just in case you

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.210
want to get started on your own I wanted
to quickly kind of tell you our

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.690
methodology for learning that you can
already apply it to learning on your own

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.170
now it'll take you a little bit more
time and then these lessons that we kind

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.610
of curate already for you but it will
also be useful for you kind of getting

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.540
some extra benefit out of these series.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.470
So all right, so this is what you do the

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.860
first thing is you're going to pick one
of the series here the second thing is

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.430
you're going to go to google and you're
going to type in there transcripts for

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.510
in the name of the series and once you
get this transcript it's really great if

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.650
you can download it or you can copy and
paste it into a Word document

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.640
or you can even print it out and then
what you're going to do is you're going

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.510
to kind of pick a scene maybe I would
want to take like the very first scene

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.390
start from the very beginning of the
series and the first thing that you're

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:07.190
going to do is watch this scene with
subtitles so you'll kind of just be

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:11.720
trying to get the context of the scene
now depending on your level if you're

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.500
intermediate or lower intermediate maybe
you'll want to actually start out by

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.800
watching it with subtitles in your
native language but if you are

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.120
intermediate to advanced then you might
want to watch it with English subtitles

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.500
right away.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.900
So after you've done this you
probably have the context if you watch

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.320
it first with subtitles in your native
language then be sure then after to

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.320
watch it again with sometimes in English
otherwise you'll move on to the next

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.860
step the next step would be to take this
transcript that you've printed out or

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.310
that you've saved and you're going to
look through it and kind of take note of

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:43.460
everything that's kind of complicated so
maybe there were some words that you

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.940
already saw that you didn't know maybe
there was something that you were like I

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.180
would not have understood that without
the subtitles, so maybe you're kind of

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.810
like highlight that and then basically
what you're going to do is go through

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.440
all the new vocabulary or expressions
that you've pointed out and you'll do a

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.950
little bit of research you look up what
do these different words mean what do

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.010
these expressions mean and then once
it's kind of like all full of notes of

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.550
like all the different definitions of
all the words and the expressions that

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.790
you didn't know the next step would be
the pronunciation so you've probably

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.700
already noticed some things that without
the subtitles you would not have understood.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.980
So these things basically
what you're going to do is pick up the

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:23.210
scene again and watch those parts
specifically so kind of listen while

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.360
you're looking at the transcript and
really try to figure out why exactly was

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.980
it that I couldn't understand this.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.929
Maybe it was due to something

00:24:29.929 --> 00:24:33.590
being pronounced in a way that you
weren't expecting so for example maybe

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.750
you saw the word "butter" but actually an
American one pronounces this butter

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:43.640
we would say [bu-der] with a sound that
sounds more like a D or maybe it was

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.000
because some words kind of connected
together some words reduced completely

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.440
so you actually want to see how is the
way that natives really pronounce this

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.669
and not just depending on your eyes and
like reading the transcript and doing

00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:58.309
this kind of over time you'll start to
kind of get used to some of these

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:00.740
tendencies of how natives really speak.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.389
Alright so once you've done all this you

00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:07.130
have watched at first got the context
broken down the transcript now it's kind

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.760
of time for the most fun part so what
you're going to do now is watch the

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.260
series without any subtitles to kind of
test everything that you've learned.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.480
If you notice that there's some part of it
that you're still struggling with then

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.500
that's no problem at all don't beat
yourself up, that means don't give

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.039
yourself a hard time or don't criticize
yourself really heavily, all you have to

00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:28.250
do is pause it and go back and try to
figure out why didn't I understand that

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.240
part and maybe watch it a few times and
so you feel really confident about

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.020
understanding the whole scene without
subtitles.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.260
Alright guys so I hope that

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.100
you'll have a lot of fun learning in
this way I hope that you'll enjoy all

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:44.299
these series and now I really want to
hear from you so the first thing that

00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:48.409
I'd like you to tell me is which of
these 10 series are you going to use to

00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:49.680
learn English with?

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.340
Second, I want you to
tell me was there some series not in

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.680
this list that you really enjoyed over
the last year?

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.549
Maybe it will even make a

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:59.269
lesson with it and also be sure to see
what other learners said because maybe

00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:02.420
you'll just find another suggestion that
you like even more.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.420
Alright guys thanks so much for joining me today,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.380
