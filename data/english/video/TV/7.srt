00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.700
In today's lesson, we will learn with a
scene from the British TV series, Peaky Blinders.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.880
Now, this series is set in the
early 1920s in England,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.520
and tells the story of the Shelby family,
and their urban street gang, the Peaky Blinders.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.020
Now, if you are a fan of mafia and family crime
stories, you should definitely stick around

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.860
because you are going to love
learning all of the expressions

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.480
and advanced vocabulary in this scene.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.860
But, I wanted to let you know first that it does contain
some explicit language and offensive words,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.700
so, if you're looking for something lighter, then
you might want to check out this playlist instead,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.720
which you can find by clicking up here.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.800
Finally, these characters come from Birmingham
in the center of England,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.540
and it can be even difficult for me
as a native speaker from the United States

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.360
to understand them sometimes.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.520
So, if the first watch you feel like
you didn't understand anything,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.620
don't worry, relax, because we are going
to help you to understand all of it,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.520
and you will understand much better the second go.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.040
So, are you ready? Let's get into it!

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.540
All right. So, now, we are going to learn all of the most
difficult vocabulary, pronunciation, and cultural context

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.840
from that clip.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.300
But, first, I wanted to let you know that
if you're new here, every single week

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.180
we make fun lessons just like this one,
so that you can understand fast-speaking natives

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.220
without getting lost,
without missing the jokes,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.940
and without subtitles.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.060
Like Pachu, who says that our lessons are helping him

So, I know you're watching this lesson 
because you get frustrated

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.760
when you can't understand natives,
whether it's in music, TV series, movies,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.180
or even in real-life conversations.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.920
And this hurts your confidence.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.420
You're scared of actually using your
English in real-life.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.480
You want to be able to confidently 
understand natives in any situation,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.580
just like your mother tongue, right?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.420
Well, this is exactly why we created
our Fluent with Friends course.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.200
Our goal for you with this course is to be able to
learn the principles of real native speech,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.720
so that you can understand natives
no matter how fast we speak,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.940
and have a lot of fun doing it.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.780
Now, in this 40-week course, you will learn alongside
the first two seasons of the TV series Friends,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.780
with innovative tools like Power Lessons, 
vocabulary memorization software, and more.
