00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.760
In this video you're going to learn English with one of the best and most popular rappers of all time, Eminem.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.800
We're covering portions of three of 
his hit songs in this lesson.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.860
Lose Yourself

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.820
The Real Slim Shady

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.880
and The Monster featuring Rihanna.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.040
Just a word of caution, these rap songs contain some profane language so listen at your own risk.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.900
If you're looking for a family-friendly lesson, be sure to check out our playlist.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.560
This is how it will work.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.120
First, you will watch each video clip
 with subtitles in English,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.580
then we will explain the meaning

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.000
of the most important words, expressions,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
cultural context and pronunciation in the lyrics.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.160
Finally, you will test everything you've learned

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.940
by watching the clip without subtitles

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.980
and answering some quiz questions.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.100
Are you ready?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.160
Let's get our groove on with Eminem.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.220
So every single week we make fun lessons with some of your favorite movies, TV series, music and more.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.260
So that you can understand fast speaking natives without getting lost,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.020
without missing the jokes,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.980
and without subtitles.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.060

as easy as the ABCs,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.680
