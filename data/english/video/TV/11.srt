Awww yeah ladies and gentlemen today we
have an English lesson with a classic

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.269
animated film Shrek so even though it's
been 18 years since the first Shrek was

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.800
screened for the first time we can
honestly say and that this amazing movie

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.769
and all of its beloved characters never
get old The Adventures of Shrek and his

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.980
friend donkey are very humorous because
it's actually parody of many other fairy

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.460
tale stories that have been adapted to
film

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.760
- Wake up
-What?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.340
so, that said, you'll get to
learn a lot of vocabulary that is

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.970
related to these classical stories and
fairy tales that take place in medieval

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.890
times. Plus, definitely pay attention
closely to all the pronunciation because

informal English but you'll also get
