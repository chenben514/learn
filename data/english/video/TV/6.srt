Aww yeah today we are learning with the one the only King of Pop Michael Jackson

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
So the song that we're learning with today Billie Jean has frequently been mentioned

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.420
by different magazine polls as one of the best songs ever made

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.460
and it's really no wonder why Michael Jackson was a genius songwriter and we can see this

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.840
particularly in the creativity of the lyrics of this song Billie Jean

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.680
Because he uses the same word to mean different things throughout the song

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.220
and we're going to explain all that to you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.200
