But before we do that, I wanted to let you know that if you get frustrated

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.280
when you can't understand fast-speaking natives,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.520
then we have a really fantastic FREE 3-part mini-course for you.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.720
It's going to help you to learn all of the pronunciation, the vocabulary,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.360
and the cultural secrets that you need to understand natives at any speed.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.440
