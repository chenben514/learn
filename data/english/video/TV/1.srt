Get ready to laugh!

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.900
Let's learn English with this hilarious
and famous scene from Friends -

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.880
The Test!

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.600
So this is a really great scene
where they play a game

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.440
to see which of the friends
knows each other best.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.220
So we get to learn a lot of very funny
facts about each of the characters.

 we help learners like you
