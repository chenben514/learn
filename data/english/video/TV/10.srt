00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.700
Aww Yeah! In today's lesson,
we're learning English with Jennifer Aniston's

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.320
hit new series, The Morning Show.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.380
So, over the holidays, I watched the first season
of this Apple TV+ Original,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.260
and I have to say I was seriously
impressed.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.080
It has superb performances, from both 
Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.120
as well as an intriguing story.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.880
And it's no surprise that it was
nominated  for several Golden Globes

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.720
which is a prestigious award in the United States.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.580
So, I thought it would be perfect for you to learn with, and don't worry because the scene we chose today

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.940
has no spoilers. So, whether or not you've
seen the show you, will be able to enjoy it

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.680
and learn with it, as it is completely
full of advanced English vocabulary.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.260
