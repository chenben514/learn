00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.820
Aww Yeah! Are you ready to learn with
one of the most popular cartoons of all time?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.940
In today's lesson, we go under the sea with
SpongeBob SquarePants and his friends,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.300
Patrick Star and Squidward.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.860
We will be learning with three clips
from three different episodes

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.700
which you might remember if
you've ever watched this classic series.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.480
So, let's dive in!

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.700
Hey! Just before we jump into learning with this clip,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.020
I wanted to let you know that if you're new here,
every single week we make fun lessons

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.570
just like this one so that you can learn
to understand fast-speaking natives

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.780
without getting lost,
without missing the jokes,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.300
and without subtitles.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.380
Just like Paula, who says that she's
learning how English is really spoken,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.000
not how she learned at the academies.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.660

So, would you like to master how natives really speak, just like you did here
