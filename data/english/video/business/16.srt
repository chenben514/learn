00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.040
You're learning with nine to five
English - Business English for the workplace.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.200
Hi, Tim here with another 925 English lesson.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.280
In today's lesson we're

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.640
going to learn how to talk about
similarities.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.260
Every day we compare products, companies, jobs - all kinds of things!

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.260
We talk about how they are different and how they are the same or similar.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.640
So how can we say two things are equal or exactly the same.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.760
For example, what if you want to say two people are the same height.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.080
One easy way is to say as tall as.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.760
For example Tom is as tall as John.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.900
You can do this with any adjectives.
You might say as smart, as as difficult

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:27.640
as, or as cheap as. Want to give this a
try? Let's start with an example of the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.530
expression we just learned. Then we'll
try some other expressions for saying

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:43.380
two things are the same. Listen to each
example then repeat it yourself. Ready?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.880
Let's get started.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.920
My old phone is just
as good as your new one.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.460
The Samsung and the LG TVs are about the same in quality.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.660
There is no real difference between
these two products.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.340
In my opinion this and the red one are
equally nice.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.540
How was that? Besides as good as we also heard two things can be about the same

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.960
or there's no real difference between
them. That's pretty easy right? And in the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:52.500
last example we heard two things can be
equally nice. Saying equally nice is just

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.530
like saying as nice as. And in the same
way you can say equally difficult

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:10.260
equally expensive or equally anything
else. Now some things are the same but

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.730
some things are just similar. When I
think of similar things I often think of

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:27.620
me and my brother. Similar appearance,
similar personality, similar beliefs. Not

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:39.030
exactly the same, just similar. That word
similar is useful. I might say my brother

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:50.490
and I are similar or quite similar or
very similar. Or I might say I am like my

00:03:50.490 --> 00:04:01.190
brother or I look like my brother. That
means we are similar or we look similar.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.959
How about some more practice? This time we'll try saying two things are similar

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:19.760
rather than exactly the same. Once again
repeat the examples after you hear them

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.400
The new Kia minivan looks kind of like a
Toyota Sienna.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.720
This website is quite similar to our
competition's site.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.220
Both Dave and Kathy are from the Midwest.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.640
I prefer afternoon meetings and so does
Tom.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.440
Great work! And did you notice that

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.460
expression both Dave and Kathy? That's a
great way to say something is true about

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:17.650
two people. For example both my brother
and I live in New York. There's another

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:26.940
easy way to say something is true about
two people. You just need the words so do

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:35.980
or so does. For example I live in New
York and so does my brother.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.660
All right we've practiced lots of expressions for showing how two things are the same

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:53.590
or similar. Well not just two things we also
practiced comparing people with these

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:02.529
expressions. But how does all this sound
in a conversation? Let's listen to a

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:11.469
short dialogue between Juan and Ellen.
Juan is asking Ellen to compare some new

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.600
laptops to their old ones.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.380
What do you think of these new laptops?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.920
They look quite similar to our old ones.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.140
In design maybe but what about quality?

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.280
Well I think the old ones are just as good as these new ones.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.820
As you heard Ellen starts

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:44.160
by saying the laptops are quite similar
in general. And when asked about quality

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.300
she uses the expression just as good as
to show they're the same quality.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.880
Now it's your turn to practice. We'll repeat
the dialogue but this time we're going

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.270
to beep out the second speakers words. You will have to say those parts yourself.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:18.000
Remember to start by saying the laptops
are quite similar. Then you'll say how

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.660
they're equal in terms of quality. Here
we go.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.100
What do you think of these new laptops?

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.600
In design maybe but what about quality?

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.500
All right that about does it for this lesson.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:59.280
we've learned some great ways to talk
about how things are similar or the same.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:08.550
In our next lesson we'll learn about the
opposite idea talking about how things

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:17.180
are different. Until then so long and
happy learning!
