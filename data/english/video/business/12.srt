00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.799
You're learning with 925 English

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:15.120
Business English for the workplace

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.529
hi Tim here with another 925 English

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.700
lesson. In today's lesson we're going to

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.460
learn how to talk about things you don't like

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.140
I'm a pretty positive person but

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.940
there are lots of things I just don't like:

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.060
getting stuck in traffic,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.450
bad customer service, long meetings.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.240
I really don't like long meetings. And you're

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.370
probably the same way. There are things

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.809
you just don't like and things you hate.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.199
So how do we talk about these things?

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.320
How do we say we don't really like

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.969
something?

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.380
Well you can say exactly that: I don't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.200
like getting stuck in traffic, for

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670
example. To say you dislike something you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.090
can just change a positive sentence into

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.020
a negative one. In the same way you can

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.140
say you're not all that fond of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.770
something because being fond of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.600
something means liking it. There are even

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.430
more ways to talk about dislikes.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.460
You can say that something isn't really your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.090
thing that's a useful expression if

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.330
you're talking about a preference so if

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.430
you're having the conversation about

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.530
where to go for lunch

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.670
you might say Greek food isn't really my

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.570
thing

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.290
you could also say i don't care for

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.870
greek food that's not really about

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.740
taking care of something rather to not

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.080
care for just means to not like

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.960
now how about practicing some of these

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.220
ideas

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.130
we're going to present some examples

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.310
after you hear each example try

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.630
repeating it yourself ready let's give

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.590
it a go

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.460
I don't really like living in a small

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.960
town

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.420
I'm not all that fond of long meetings

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.770
sales isn't really my thing

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.490
I don't care for the new TV ads

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.810
so those expressions are useful for

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.620
talking about basic dislikes and we

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.930
often use them when we're being polite

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.430
or trying not to make someone feel bad i

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.730
mean sometimes we don't want to sound

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.180
too negative right but then again

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.690
sometimes we really don't like something

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.650
and we want people to know it if someone

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.470
suggest something that you just can't

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.710
accept or if you need to really make it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.510
clear how you feel

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.710
you might need a stronger expression in

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.580
this case you might say you really hate

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.260
something

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.350
hate is certainly a strong word

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.200
in fact you should be a bit careful with

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.800
it

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.010
nobody minds if you say you hate getting

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.100
stuck in traffic but if you say you hate

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.180
someone's idea they might get upset

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.660
in that case it's best to use a softer

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.500
expression other expressions you can use

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.420
our can't stand or more simply really

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.100
don't like so you might say I can't

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.420
stand waiting around in airports or I

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.030
really don't like waiting around in

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.290
airports those are both pretty strong

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.350
there's also another word that is

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.340
similar to hate but even stronger and

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.870
that word is to test if you say you

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.230
detest something then you really hated

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.130
and for an even stronger statement you

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.720
can say you absolutely detest something

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.480
for example I absolutely detest exams

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.790
that's about as strong as you can

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.020
express a dislike without cursing now

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.020
it's your turn to try using these

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.180
expressions

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.090
once again you'll hear some examples

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.169
after each example repeat what you hear

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.280
ready let's begin

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.689
I really hate websites that are slow

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:43.729
I can't stand this new software

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:53.249
I absolutely detest powerpoint

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.239
I really don't like public speaking at

00:05:57.239 --> 00:06:03.889
all

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.280
ok so we've done some practice on

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.310
talking about things you don't like

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.039
but there are some things that you don't

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.409
really think positively or negatively

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.610
about for me that's how i feel about

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.919
where to go eat lunch

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.860
I don't really care and that's exactly

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.789
what you can say i don't really care

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.539
you could also say it's all the same to

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.469
me that's useful if a group is trying to

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.469
make a decision and it's not important

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:43.310
to you what they choose one more useful

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.629
expression is I don't mind if you don't

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.349
mind something it means it doesn't

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.370
bother you if you ask me whether I hate

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.360
android i'll say i don't mind it

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.810
and by that i mean i don't like or

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.069
dislike it

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.870
it's just ok let's practice using some

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.330
of these expressions for when you need

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.080
there like or dislike something once

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.289
again repeat the examples after you hear

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:19.039
them

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:28.870
I don't really care one way or the other

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.750
it's all the same to me

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.020
I don't mind taking the bus to work

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:45.970
alright we've been doing some great

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.180
practice but how does this sound in the

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.810
conversation we're going to hear a short

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.410
dialogue between two co-workers they are

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.530
talking about where to go for lunch

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.270
John suggested we meet at the new cafe

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.860
on the corner

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.190
hmm well I don't really care for that

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.510
cafe

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.990
alright so what about the deli across

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.460
the street

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.610
yeah okay I don't mind that place

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.970
how did that sound

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.840
one possibility is a new cafe on the

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.410
corner but the lady doesn't really care

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.480
for that cafe

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.469
however she doesn't mind the deli across

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:39.430
the street now it's your turn to

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.089
practice will repeat the dialogue but

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:46.210
this time we're going to be about the

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.510
woman's words you will have to say those

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.710
parts yourself remember to start by

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.240
saying you don't care for the cafe then

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.320
you'll say that you don't mind the deli

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.480
here we go John suggested we meet at the

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.970
new cafe on the corner

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:20.180
alright so what about the deli across

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:28.710
the street

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.180
alright so we've learned some great ways

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.540
to talk about things you don't like as

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.570
well as things you hate and things you

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.750
don't really care about in our next

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.260
lesson we'll move on to look at how to

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
talk about your ideas and make

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.820
suggestions

00:09:50.820 --> 00:10:00.140
until then so long and happy learning
