00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.109
the Business English podcast for professionals

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.170
on the move

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.500
in this business English Pod episode
will be looking at ways to give

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.520
and ask for opinion. We'll be looking
both more formal

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.050
or careful language as well as more
informal

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.050
or direct language. Giving and asking for
opinions

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
is a very important part of meetings and
discussions of all types.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.600
first let's listen to more formal
situation

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.270
we'll be listening to part of a meeting
at Digi Soft

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.210
a multinational software company. Sheila,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.230
a vice president, is talking to wall

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.940
George and Bruce, 3 software engineers,
about the deadline for the new software

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.790
release.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.040
Release here means "Launch"

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:07.329
that is bring the product onto the
market

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.100
so let's move on to the topic of

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.950
release date.Gentleman when do you think we'll be able to launch this product?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.399
Walt? Well, I tend to feel that

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.619
we should probably be able to start
testing the product

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.509
EN April that means that if all goes
well

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.789
we can happen this release the me all

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.899
June I say thank you walt

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.520
what's your reaction to that group May
or June

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.220
well from my point of view that sounds
about right excuse me

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.099
may I come in here I wonder if I could
say something go ahead george

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.630
what would you like to add well it seems
to me that may is much much too early

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.709
actually we are still having some pretty
major problems with bugs in the update

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:52.189
engine

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.890
and I just don't see how we will be able
to fix those books

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.700
okay now let's listen to george

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.710
Bruce on wall walk into the break room
right after the meeting

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.790
Sheila their boss is not here this

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.810
is a more informal situation hey guys

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.590
did you see the Chelsea Liverpool game
last night what did you think

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.160
all quite I gave her Chelsea look pretty
good

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.410
cue always have to rub it in turns you
bruise

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.180
you know unlivable fan have that you
jewish

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.890
actually that was one of the greatest
games ever see

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.780
but the way you guys keep telling the
boss we can finish the product by May

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.840
numbers are going to have time to watch
in world football games

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.750
we're all going to be working overtime
every night burning the midnight oil

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.130
so now you've heard both formal and
informal conversations

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.730
first let's look at the form
conversation

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.530
how to Sheila ass for her employees
opinions

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.420
Sheila is in charge she is the boss

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.870
and the chairperson of the meeting one
way for her to ask for an employee's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.580
opinion

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.440
is simply to say his name with the
rising intonation

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.640
work home gentleman when do you think we
will be able to launch this product

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.260
what she'll also use some other ways

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.950
to ask firm place opinions all these
ways are relatively formal

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.030
the signal that this is a formal meeting

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.400
she says I say thank you walt

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.550
what's your reaction to that Bruce and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.640
go ahead george what would you like to
add

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.220
together with the speakers try some
other form of races

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.630
for asking for an opinion how do you
feel about that

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.040
Cecilia

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.150
could you please share your thoughts on
that fair

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.550
what's your view on this Richard

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.820
Tony what's your feelings on the 8th

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.720
now let's look at the language wall
Bruce and George use

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.160
to express their opinions informal
situation lot says

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.549
well I tend to feel that we should be
able to start testing the product

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.910
EN April this language

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.210
I tend to feel that shows careful

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.670
formal tone what uses the stone

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.260
because he is talking to his boss and
perhaps because he's not sure

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.100
whether or not the others will agree
with them let's keep listening

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.110
I say thank you walt

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.750
what's your reaction to that group May
or June

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.830
well from my point of view that sounds
about right

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.350
Bruce likewise uses more formal careful
language

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.610
well from my point of view this makes
him some more polite

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.530
since he's talking to his boss in
addition

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.880
begins in time to think giving yourself
time to think

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.160
is another reason to use these phrases
haha George

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.520
how did he offer his opinion excuse me

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.400
may I come in here I wonder if I could
say something go ahead george

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.930
what would you like to add well it seems
to me that may is much much too early

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.730
think about the ways to George users to
express his opinion

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.160
I wonder if I could say something and

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.060
well it seems to me that these

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.700
ways expression are quite careful George
has a good reason to be careful doesn t

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.919
he disagrees with his colleagues now
let's practice some

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.860
further formal were careful phrases for
expressing your opinion

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.980
I have the impression that

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.740
he didn't really want to come

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:02.330
don't you think that that's a little
early

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.380
I tend to feel it's a bit too early to
start

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.990
next let's turn

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.240
a more informal discussion between will
Bruce and George

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.250
remember there in the breakroom

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.660
right after the meeting Bruce ass
georgian Walt

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.510
hey guys did you see the Chelsea luv
all-gay

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.140
last night what the debate will quiet
gave her

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:34.160
Chelsea look for a ticket this is an
informal relaxed discussion among

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.010
colleagues

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.390
you can tell it's informal because Bruce
uses the informal word

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.000
guys to address george wall also

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.770
he says what do you think this is an
informal way to ask for an opinion

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.860
what says cue always have to read the
tendency to bruise

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.460
you know am a Liverpool fan to rub
something in

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.680
is an Indian it means to remind someone
on purpose

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.570
something that is uncomfortable or
painful here

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.780
it's done as a joke it sounds like Walt
is a Liverpool fan

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.910
and he's unhappy because Chelsea won the
game

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.750
let's keep listening how bad you jewish
actually

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.990
that was one of the greatest games ever
see how about you

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.300
is another direct way to ask for an
opinion next

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.700
notice how George start a sentence with
actually

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.860
actually is a direct or informal way to
state an opinion

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.900
it shows us the George has something new

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.240
were surprising decide with George

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.490
practice more direct ways to state an
opinion the point

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:50.189
ease we doing very well in this market

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:55.479
the way I see it we're heading for
trouble

00:07:55.479 --> 00:08:02.320
obviously his only one choice

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.770
basically I think we have two options

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.130
finally let's listen to the and the
dialogue again

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.420
have that you jewish actually that was
one of the greatest games ever see

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.330
but the way you guys keep telling the
boss we can finish the product by May

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.760
numbers are going to have time to watch
him win football games

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.820
George means that Bruce on wall keep
telling the boss

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.650
that they can meet the may deadline
everyone is going to have to work very

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.800
hard in fact

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.690
they're going to have to work so hard
that they won't have any time to watch

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.490
football games
