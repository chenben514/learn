00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.580
Hi, Tim here with another 925 English lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.360
In today’s lesson, we’re going to&nbsp;
learn how to express doubt in English.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.200
Have you ever been in a meeting when someone&nbsp;
says something and you think “hmm… I’m not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.220
really sure about that.” You might be unsure about&nbsp;
whether it’s true, or whether it’s a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.060
We call that feeling “doubt.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.800
And it’s important that you are able to&nbsp;
express doubt confidently and politely.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.700
Now, if you’re a little bit unsure of something,&nbsp;
you can use the expression I just used, and say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:20.760
something like “I’m not really sure” or “I’m not&nbsp;
100% sure.” Or you could say very directly “well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:30.780
I have a few doubts.” Another way to express doubt&nbsp;
is with a question, like “Are you certain that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.080
would work?” Just by asking the question,&nbsp;
you are telling people you have doubts.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.280
Let’s try a bit of practice with some&nbsp;
of these ways of expressing mild doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.320
Listen to each example, then repeat&nbsp;
it yourself. Ready? Let’s get started.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.760
 I’m not 100% sure about that.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.760
Hmm… well, I have a few doubts.&nbsp;

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.200
That seems a bit unlikely to me.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.240
Are you certain that would work?

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:36.960
You might notice that these expressions sound more&nbsp;
polite than just saying “I doubt that.” The reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:51.060
for this is softening words like “a few” or “a&nbsp;
bit” and hesitation words like “hmm” and “well.”

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:01.020
But sometimes you may be less concerned about&nbsp;
being polite. Instead, you might want to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:10.080
strong doubt. And to do that, we can be&nbsp;
more direct. For example, you could say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.480
“there’s no way that would work.” That&nbsp;
certainly sounds clear and direct, doesn’t it?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.580
You could also say “that’s simply not&nbsp;
feasible,” which means it won’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.960
Or “I really don’t think that’s a possibility.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.980
These are all ways to show you have strong&nbsp;
doubts about what’s being talked about.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.540
Let’s try some examples of showing&nbsp;
strong doubts. Remember to repeat the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.846
examples after you hear them. 

00:03:48.846 --> 00:03:52.880
There’s no way that would&nbsp;&nbsp;work.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.800
I’m sorry but that’s simply not feasible.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.240
I seriously doubt it.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.580
I really don’t think that’s a possibility at all.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.940
These are strong and direct expressions.&nbsp;
But you did hear one common way to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:36.540
them a bit more polite: the expression “I’m&nbsp;
sorry but.” You can use this to introduce a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.680
strong or honest opinion, such as “I’m&nbsp;
sorry but that’s really not possible.”

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:53.460
Now, what if you don’t have strong doubts, and&nbsp;
you’re simply unsure which of two competing ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.980
or positions you support? Well, in this case,&nbsp;
you might want to take a “neutral” position.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:10.620
If you’re neutral, it means you haven’t decided&nbsp;
yet or you don’t want to commit to one side.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:20.940
In this case, you might say “I could go either&nbsp;
way” or “I can see both sides of this issue.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.380
Another way to express this idea is with&nbsp;
the idiom “I’m on the fence about it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.280
That simply means you’re not on one side&nbsp;
or the other, but right in the middle.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.140
How about some practice with these&nbsp;
expressions? Once again, repeat the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.747
examples after you hear them. 

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:52.997
I could go either way on&nbsp;&nbsp;this.

00:05:47.997 --> 00:06:36.540
ready to make a decision yet because you need&nbsp;
more information or the future is uncertain.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.537
I’m kind of on the fence about it.

00:06:03.454 --> 00:06:07.911
I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.

00:06:11.161 --> 00:06:15.910
Yeah, well, I can see two sides to this issue.

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:29.280
Did you&nbsp;&nbsp;hear that expression “we’ll just have to wait and&nbsp;
see?” That’s simply a way of saying you’re not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.300
All right, we’ve practiced&nbsp;
different ways of expressing doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:51.480
But how does this sound in a conversation? Let’s&nbsp;
listen to a short dialog between Nick and Kendra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.160
Nick is suggesting ways of reducing&nbsp;
costs, and Kendra is expressing doubt.

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:05.154
Nick: One way to reduce&nbsp;costs is to get a smaller office.

00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:08.220
Kendra: I’m not 100% sure about that.&nbsp;

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:12.028
Nick: Well, we could cut staff instead.

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:18.120
Kendra: I’m sorry but that’s simply not feasible.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.740
Now it’s your turn to practice. We’ll repeat the&nbsp;
dialog, but this time we’re going to beep out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:33.900
the second speaker’s words. You will have to say&nbsp;
those parts yourself. Remember to start by saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:44.100
you’re not 100% sure about the idea. Then say you&nbsp;
think Nick’s second idea simply isn’t feasible.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.280
Ready? Here we go!

00:07:49.898 --> 00:07:53.400
One way to reduce costs&nbsp;
is to get a smaller office.&nbsp;

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:09.120
Well, we could cut staff instead.

00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:19.200
Okay, that’s all for this lesson! We’ve learned&nbsp;
how to express mild and strong doubt, as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:28.260
as how to take a neutral position. We’ll be back&nbsp;
soon with some more useful English expressions.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.240
Until then, so long and happy learning!
