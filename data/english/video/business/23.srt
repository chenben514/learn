Business Skills 360, the podcast that looks
at the other side of English.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:20.449
Hello and welcome back to the Skills 360 podcast.
I'm your host, Tim Simmons, and today I want

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:28.089
to continue our look at tips for succeeding
in a job interview in English.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:36.320
In our last lesson, we talked about preparation
for introducing yourself and questions about

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.830
strengths and weaknesses. That's all about
you as a person, or your character. In this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:53.670
lesson, I'd like to home in on what you've
done, or your actions and behavior.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.851
The first big question you'll get about what
you have done pertains to achievements. As

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:10.070
in: "what achievements are you most proud
of?" Or "tell us about a recent achievement?"

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.429
Now, when you think back on your accomplishments,
what should you choose to discuss? Well, rather

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:26.450
than boasting about purely individual accomplishments,
think of something that connects to the bigger

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.889
picture. Or state why your accomplishment
helped the company.

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:41.649
So, don't just say "I oversaw an expansion
of our department from four to nine people."

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:50.350
Link that to overall company goals, or say
why that is an achievement. So you could add

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.759
something like: "That helped support the
company in its overall growth goals.ï¿½

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.049
Another important point when talking about
accomplishments: give credit where credit

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.317
is due, and demonstrate gratitude for others'

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:14.000
efforts. Yes, it's a question about you.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.650
But most positions require teamwork, and so
most companies are looking for team players.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.450
That's why it's a good idea to throw in
something like "of course, none of it would

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.800
have been possible without a stellar team
of salespeople."

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.720
Besides questions about your achievements,
you're likely to face questions about past

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.010
behavior. Especially common is the question
"tell us about a time when you demonstrated

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:58.790
a particular quality?" For example, leadership,
or problem-solving, or creativity. In this

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.470
case, the interviewers want some evidence,
or proof, of your abilities.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:15.200
It's a good idea to have some situations in
mind before your interview. And you don't

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.230
have to think up different situations for
every imaginable quality or characteristic.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:31.820
Instead, think of a few situations that you
could use for different qualities. I mean,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.940
maybe there's a particular time when your
leadership, problem-solving, and creativity

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:48.010
all came into play. You can bring that situation
up in response to a variety of questions.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.460
And when you discuss what you did, keep it
to three simple parts: the situation, what

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:05.220
you did, and the result. Here's an example
of this approach to a question about problem-solving:

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:13.740
"Well, just last month we had a big project
with a demanding client, and three developers

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.720
got sick. There was no way we could finish
on time without help. So I managed to flex

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.100
some other projects and transfer some staff.
In the end, we had good outcomes and happy

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.850
clients."

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:38.430
That was a response to a question about problem-solving.
But notice that I could easily modify the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:46.570
answer to fit a question about leadership,
or handling clients, or project management.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.940
That's what I mean about keeping a few versatile
situations in mind, especially if you're

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.170
not so confident in your interview English
skills.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:09.500
Okay, so there's one more issue I want to
address: questions about conflict. As in "tell

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.380
us about a time you had to deal with conflict
with a co-worker?" Or "tell me about a

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.520
time you had a major disagreement with your
boss?"

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.311
With questions about conflict, interviewers
want to see that you can communicate, that

00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:36.610
you care about relationships, and - ultimately
- that you're not a jerk. For that last

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:44.220
reason, the worst thing you can do is to throw
someone under the bus or even just to sound

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:54.720
bitter. So follow the same formula of: situation,
what you did, and the result. And spin the

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.350
conflict as a constructive experience.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.540
For example, you might say something like:
"well, a co-worker was talking about me

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.090
behind my back. After a few tough weeks, I
took her for coffee, and I asked her point

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:19.680
blank what was going on. Turns out she felt
threatened by my success. I managed to allay

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:28.960
her fears, and now we get along great."
Does that make sense? Situation, action, and

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.320
result, with a positive and constructive focus.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.560
All right, so today we've focused on English
interview tips for answering questions about

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.750
your experience and behavior. That includes
accomplishments, which should be connected

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:57.810
to the big picture and shown to include others.
We've also talked about how to answer behavioral

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:07.020
questions using a situation, action, result
response. And remember to think about some

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.700
positive and negative situations beforehand,
so you're ready.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.310
That's all for today.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.310
So long. And see you again soon.
