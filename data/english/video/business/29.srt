00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.129
Hello and welcome back to the Skills 360 podcast. 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.070
I’m your host, Tim Simmons, and today I
want to look at some of the business English

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.010
skills everyone needs in order to be successful.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.790
As any guru worth his weight in salt will
tell you, business is all about relationships.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.930
That means connecting with new people, and
maintaining good relations with people in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.410
your existing network.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.410
And one of the ways we do this is through
small talk.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.070
We call it small talk because it’s not about
big important business topics.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.780
It’s about things like the weekend, the
weather, sports, or family.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.920
You hear it every time someone walks into
the office and says “Oh hey Dave, how’s

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.259
it going?”

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.170
Or at a conference when someone says “So,
where are you from?”

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.170
Making small talk in English allows us to
connect with people, find out more about them,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530
and set a mood.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.580
This kind of conversation involves a back
and forth of simple comments, questions, and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.750
answers.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.229
You need to show interest in the other person,
but also reveal a bit about yourself.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.510
And it’s important to stick to topics that
are common to both people.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.640
Once you’ve broken the ice with small talk,
then you can move on to bigger topics.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.980
And that’s where you bring in the skill
of expressing opinions in English.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.509
Exactly how you do that depends on the situation.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.860
If you’re in a meeting and want to add your
perspective, you might just introduce it with

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.640
an expression like “the way I see things”
or “as far as I’m concerned.”

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.760
But if you’re making a suggestion or pitching
an idea, there are a couple of ways to go

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.260
about it.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:36.120
You might do it carefully with words like
“perhaps” or “maybe” or “we could.”

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.520
Or, if you want to state something more confidently,
you can use stronger words like “have to”

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.300
or “should.”

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:55.000
The important thing here is that you assess
the situation and adapt your language accordingly.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.660
If you’re new to a team or the most junior
person in the room and you come out with guns

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.000
blazing, telling everyone what must happen,
you’ll be shooting yourself in the foot.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.280
After all, conversation isn’t just about
speaking; it’s also about listening, and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.069
that leads me to asking questions.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.410
I don’t just mean “yes or no” questions.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.290
I mean substantive questions that show that
you’re listening and engaged.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.200
This could include follow-up questions during
small talk, which helps you connect with people.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.900
Beyond small talk, this also includes discerning
and sincere questions about people’s ideas.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:57.010
This is a big part of being an active listener,
which means listening to understand, not just

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.739
listening to respond.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.019
Of course, being a good listener doesn’t
mean being a yes-man.

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:14.069
Participating in a meeting or negotiations
in English requires the ability to reject

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.419
ideas.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.620
And that’s not as simple as saying “no”
or “I disagree.”

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.419
Most situations require a more nuanced or
careful approach.

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:37.069
If you don’t like someone’s idea, you
might soften your comment by expressing uncertainty.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:43.169
For example, you might say “I’m not sure
that’s the best way to do this.”

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.439
Or “I wonder if that might be too expensive.”

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:55.510
You can also use the “yes but” approach,
such as “I see what you’re saying, but

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.509
I’m not sure we can do that.”

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.580
But be careful with this kind of softening
language.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.419
If you’re in a position to say no or reject
something, be clear about it.

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.569
You can still be diplomatic without waffling.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:21.599
To do that, you can comment on the positive
aspects of the idea, or the intention behind

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.520
them, before saying “no.”

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.409
For example, you could say “I agree that
would help our branding, but we just can’t

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.409
afford it right now.”

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:42.169
Or “I appreciate your concerns for the timeline,
but we have to postpone this.”

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:49.960
Rejecting ideas effectively is one aspect
of being decisive and getting results.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.589
And that brings me to one last skill I want
to mention today: getting people to take action.

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:04.190
You’ve probably been in an English meeting
where there was a lot of great discussion,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.379
but no real action points.

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.699
So you need to learn how to delegate effectively.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.349
I don’t just mean giving orders.

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.460
“Jenny, take care of the report” sounds
like an order.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.960
But effective delegation at the end of a meeting
sounds more like “Jenny, I’d like you

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.999
to take care of the report.”

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.650
Or maybe “Jenny, I think you’re the best
person to handle the report.”

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:39.060
Alright, so we’ve looked at five essential
business English skills.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:48.409
Let’s do a quick recap: you need to know
how to make small talk, express opinions,

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.240
and ask good questions.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:58.330
At the same time, you need to be able to reject
ideas and get action from people.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.669
That’s all for today.

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:07.770

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520
Happy learning.
