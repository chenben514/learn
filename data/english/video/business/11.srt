00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.309
you're learning with nine to five
English. Business English for the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:23.430
workplace. Hi Tim here with another 9 to
5 English lesson. In today's lesson we're

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.230
going to learn how to talk about likes
and preferences. Talking about things we

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.710
like is something we do all the time. Whether you're in a meeting a casual

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.260
conversation or just having lunch
there's always a chance to talk about

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.670
what you like. And sometimes talking
about what you like means talking about

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.199
a preference. By preference
I mean liking one thing more than

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.640
something else. For example maybe you
want to say you think Sony is better

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.798
than LG. How can you do that

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:17.520
? Well one way is to just say you prefer Sony to LG. You

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:27.900
could also say you're more into Sony or
that you'd take a Sony  over an LG. But what

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.320
if you're talking about doing things? Say
you prefer talking to customers instead

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.270
of sending them emails. In this case you
can say you would rather talk with

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.979
customers then send them emails. Let's
practice using these expressions for

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.740
talking about preferences. Listen to each
example then repeat it yourself. Ready?

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.580
Let's get started!
I'd much rather live in Seattle than Boston

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.820
I'm more into French food than Italian.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.430
I prefer magazines to books.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.060
I take an iPhone over
Android phone any day.

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:46.519
So we've practiced different ways of
talking about a preference but what if

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.730
you're not comparing I mean what if
you're having a conversation about cars

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:01.489
for example and you just want to say
that you like Toyotas well the easy way

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:10.280
is just to say I like Toyota's but
rather than just using the verb like you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:22.099
can use adjectives such as keen on or
partial to or fond of and don't forget

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.720
which preposition goes with which
adjectives you can say you're keen on

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.129
Toyota's but not that you're fond on
Toyota's let's have a little practice

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:44.000
using these expressions to talk about
things you like once again repeat the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.930
examples after you hear them I'm quite
keen on the new Samsung monitors

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.650
I'm partial to European wine

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.730
I'm fond of travel and exploring new
places

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.200
The Times is one of my favorite
newspapers

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.690
as you heard we can also use one of my
favorites to talk about likes and that's

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.860
another example of a group of words that
you use to express an idea just like

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.770
keen on or partial to one of the tricks
to learning natural English is

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.310
remembering word combinations like this
alright so we practiced talking about

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.750
what you like but what about things you
really like in other words what about

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:12.030
things you love for starters you can use
that word love or even say that there's

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:20.040
nothing you love more you might also say
you can't get enough of something or

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.840
that you're a huge fan of something once
again you might notice these are

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.580
combinations of words and you need to
remember and practice the entire

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:42.120
expression so let's give this a try
remember to repeat each example I really

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.430
love what the marketing department has
done

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.529
I can't get enough of Thai food

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.090
I'm a huge fan of the new Nike ads

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.110
there's nothing I love more than a
weekend by the sea

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:28.110
as you can hear we can use love for all
sorts of things not just people and in a

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:35.179
later lesson we'll have a look at the
opposite feeling as well things you hate

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:42.839
so how does all this sound in real life
let's listen to a short dialogue between

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:49.919
two colleagues one of them wants to know
about where the other person is planning

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:58.559
to rent an office so are you thinking of
renting a new office in London no I'd

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:06.449
much rather be somewhere quieter oh yeah
any place in particular well I'm a huge

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.599
fan of Cambridge did you hear how that
worked

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:19.110
the second person said that he would
much rather be somewhere more quiet than

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.579
London and when asked about what city
might be preferable he said he's a huge

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:35.519
fan of Cambridge not too difficult right
now it's your turn to practice will

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:40.649
repeat the dialogue but this time we're
going to beep out

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:47.129
the second speakers words you will have
to say those parts yourself remember to

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:53.489
start by saying where you would rather
work then say the name of the place

00:07:53.489 --> 00:08:01.889
where you'd really like to have your
office here we go so are you thinking of

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:08.139
renting a new office in London

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:18.800
oh yeah any place in particular

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:29.320
all right so we've learned some great
ways to talk about preferences as well

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:36.750
as things you like and love in our next
lesson we'll talk about the opposite

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:47.220
things you dislike or hate until then so
long and happy learning
