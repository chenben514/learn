You're learning with 925 English -
business English for the workplace.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.230
Hi Tim here with their first nine to
five English lesson. Appropriately enough

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.340
we're kicking off with the lesson on how
to say hello to colleagues and customers

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.420
in English. But before we get to the
lesson, let me take a second to tell you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.800
what 925 english is all about and how
you can use it.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.210
925 English lessons give you chunks of
language and English expressions that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.890
you can use in work in business. We get
straight to the point with lots of

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.269
examples we give you phrases you can say
in different situations and advice on

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.739
why and how we use them. Sound good?

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.630
All right let's get going! So it's pretty
easy to greet someone in english isn't it?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.810
We can say good morning or hello or just
high and we might add something like my

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.430
name is Tim Smith or a question like
how's it going. But what's the difference?

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.750
How do we choose which greeting to use?
Well in business, like in life, it depends

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.590
on the situation.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.859
That includes who we're talking to and
where we're having the conversation. So

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.240
let's go through three situations and
practice some appropriate ways of saying

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.110
hello. The first situation I want to
practice is greeting someone you have

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.170
never met before. Maybe you're at a
conference or on a flight or walking

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.970
into a meeting with the new customer. We
need to be friendly but professional

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:19.450
right? So how do we do that? Well we need
to start with something like "hello" "hi" or

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.519
"good morning" That's the actual hello
part of the greeting but then we need to

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.890
add something more. You can either
introduce yourself including your name

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.410
and maybe your job or company. Or you
could get the conversation started with

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.500
a question. And because it's someone you
just met we avoid informal expressions

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.060
that means saying something like "how are you"

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.299
instead of "how's it going." Alright let's
give this a try and practice some

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.060
examples Listen carefully to each
example then repeat the greeting

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.120
yourself. Ready? Let's get started!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.850
Hello there I'm Paul Fulton

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.430
Good morning my name's Shelly

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:33.590
Hi i'm Dave Hall from Delta Enterprises

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:44.580
Good afternoon Liz Howard. How are you
today?

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:54.080
How do you do Frank Little VP regional
sales.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.080
Great

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.420
Did you hear how we start with the greeting then we give our name or ask a question?

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.320
and sometimes we say who we weren't for or a job title. So that's how we say

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.250
hello to someone. Now how can we respond to someone we've just met when they've

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.400
said hello to us? Well you can begin by
saying hello or something similar or

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.580
instead of hello you might say something
like "nice to meet you." And it's always a

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.760
good idea to use the other person's name
in your response, like "nice to meet you

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.610
Dave." After your initial greeting then
you need to introduce yourself with my

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:57.460
name is or just "I'm" meaning I am. Let's
practice this kind of greeting. We'll play

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.430
an example then you can repeat the
greeting yourself. Ready let's get started.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:14.470
Nice to meet you Tony. I'm Carolyn Samus

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.650
Hi Peg. My name is Kurt lang

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:29.350
Good meeting you Paul. I'm Gene Dupont

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.120
Pleasure to meet you Frank. My name's
Laura Chang.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:43.370
Nice work. But how do these introductions sound in real life?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.310
Well, let's listen to a short dialogue to
find out. You'll hear Amber and Shelly,

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.699
two women at a company party. They've
never met before and they want to start

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.900
a conversation. So they start with the
greeting and a response to that greeting.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.040
Let's have a listen!

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:15.100
Hi there I don't think we've met before
I'm Amber from marketing. Oh hi nice to

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.660
meet you Amber. Shelley Davis. Sales.
Pleasure Shelly. Quite the setup here

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:30.680
isn't it? So did you hear how that worked
the first person started by saying hi

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.340
then she introduced herself and the
second person followed the same pattern.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:45.120
Its friendly and professional and once
they've done this they can start a

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:53.000
conversation. Now it's your turn to
practice will repeat the dialogue but

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.050
this time we're going to beep out the
response and you can play the role of

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:08.100
Shelley. You'll need to say hi nice to
meet you and your name. If you want you

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:15.300
can add what department you work in. Here we go!

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.820
hi there I don't think we've met before

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:29.120
I'm Amber for marketing

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:40.120
Pleasure Shelly quite the setup here
isn't it?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.200
great work! Now what if you already know the person?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.949
For example if you want to greet a work colleague or friend?

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:56.320
Well this time we can be a bit more
informal. That means instead of hello or

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:05.130
good morning, we might use hi or hey and
because we're talking to someone we know

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:12.229
we don't need to say our name. Instead we ask a friendly little question that

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:16.180
means something like "how are you?"

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:23.449
Let's give it a try. We'll provide some
examples. Listen carefully and repeat for

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:26.729
yourself. Ready? Let's begin!

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:36.550
Hey there Bob. How's it going?

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.200
Good to see you June.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.240
Morning Lana. what's up?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:56.790
Oh hi Chuck. What's new?

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:04.840
Ok just a note here on answering
questions. If it's a how question like,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:14.620
how's it going, we can say good or not
too bad. But if someone uses what in a

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:21.770
question, we need to say something like
not much or give them some actual

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.330
information. Alright?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:30.080
How about a little dialogue to
show us how this more informal greeting

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:37.810
sound. We'll hear Kobe and Liz two
co-workers making small talk before a

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.960
meeting. Ready?

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:48.920
Oh hey Liz. How's things?
Hi Kobe! Not too bad. And you? Hangin' in there.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:58.540
So did you hear how that was more
informal? The speakers used hey and hi

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:05.240
and short simple expressions. But what
does hanging in there mean?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:12.820
Well it's the same as not to bad
and that's a good way to answer the

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:20.680
informal question "how's things?" Now it's
your turn to practice. We'll repeat the

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.810
dialogue but this time we're going to be
about the response and you can play the

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:35.680
role of Liz. You'll need to say hi answer
the question how's things and ask Coby

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.950
a similar question. Here we go!

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:51.130
Oh, hey Liz. how's things?

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.200
Hanging in there.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.330
Great! That was attacked little lesson
wasn't it? We've practiced different ways

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.300
to greet new people,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:09.460
introduce yourself and respond to
introductions. We've also practiced

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:16.580
greeting friends and colleagues. We'll be
back soon with another 925 English

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.690
lesson. Until then so long and happy
learning!
