You're learning with 925 English!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.100
Business English for the workplace!

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.740
Hi Tim here with another 925 English
lesson. Last time we had a look at how to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.840
start a conversation. In this lesson
we're going to learn how to keep a

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.730
conversation going. After all there's no
point in striking up a conversation with

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.250
someone if you can't keep it going. But
what does that involve? I mean it's more

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.979
than just asking and answering questions
right? So what kinds of things can we say

00:00:51.979 --> 00:01:00.309
or do to make the conversation flow
naturally? Well one important way that we

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.629
keep a conversation going

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.629
is by showing interest in what someone
says.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.860
If the person makes a comment about
something like the weather or work,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.140
you need to respond with interest.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.040
So what can we say to show we are interested?

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.580
Well there are a few ways we can do this.
First you can give an expression of

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:35.590
interest like 'really' or 'is that right'.
Then you can make a comment or a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.360
question about it. You might also just
pick out one idea that the person

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.929
mentioned and make a little question
about it. Let's practice some examples of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.350
showing interest in this way.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.770
Listen to each example then repeated
yourself. Ready? Let's get started!

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.640
Is that right? Wow, I hear it's beautiful
this time of year.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.020
No kidding! That must be such an exciting job.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.740
Oh really! That must have been amazing

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.840
Is that right? So then what did he say?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.840
 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.840
Okay, so showing interest is important but
how does it sound in real life?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.510
Let's listen to a short dialogue between two travelers. They're talking about where

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.550
they are 'headed' or traveling to.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.400
And where you headed? Home to seoul if we ever get out of here.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.030
South Korea, hey? Never been but I've
heard great things. You like it there?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.670
Yeah for sure. You know it's a big crazy
city with lots happening.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.000
Did you hear the expression of interest
there? One person mentioned he is going

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.640
to Seoul and the other person invited
more information about that topic.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.400
And you might notice that in a casual
conversation like this we don't talk too

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.400
long about one thing before giving the
other person a chance to talk.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.980
And now's a good time to give you a chance to talk.
So let's try a little practice.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.739
We'll repeat the dialogue but this time we're going to beep out the response that

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:54.709
shows interest. You will have to say that
part. Remember that to show interest we

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.309
make a little comment and then ask a
question. Here we go.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.100
And where you headed?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.480
Home to seoul we ever get out of here.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.300
Yeah for sure. You know it's a big crazy
city with lots happening.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:32.640
Nice work! Now a conversation doesn't just continue on
one topic forever right? At some point

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.800
the speakers change the subject but you
can't just suddenly start talking about

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.600
something different that would be
strange because natural conversation

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.220
flows;  it doesn't jump around.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.020
So exactly
how do we change the subject?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.120
Well you need a little transition. Just a
little word or expression that means

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.220
"hey let's talk about something different now"
That might be just a word like now or it

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.520
might be a phrase like by the way.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.860
Let's practice changing the subject with a few examples. Remember to repeat what you hear.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.120
Ready? Let's give it a try.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.120
Speaking of summer, how does our third
quarter look?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.240
Oh before I forget, are you going on the
trip next month?

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.820
By the way, did I tell you that we're
headed to Hawaii at Christmas?

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.620
And you? Has it been a good month?

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.180
As you can see you can change the
subject to several different topics.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:15.440
You might want to move the conversation
toward work or to recent events or to travel plans.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.100
Or, if you think you've
talked a lot about yourself, you might

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.720
want to change the topic to the other
person.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.340
So as we've seen conversation

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:35.219
flows from topic to topic and back and
forth between people but what about

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:41.189
ending a conversation? What do you say
when you want to draw it to a close?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.779
Well all you need is some kind of excuse
or reason for leaving. Maybe you need to

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:56.889
use the restroom or make a phone call.
And when you give your excuse you can

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:02.889
introduce it with something like "I
should" or "I need to."

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.960
Let's practice some examples of ending a conversation.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.960
Once again, repeat the examples after you
hear them. Ready?

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.000
It's been nice chatting but I suppose I
should go find my seat.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.140
It's getting pretty late and I should
really be heading home.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.420
If you'll excuse me, I just need to make a quick call.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.650
Well, I  shouldn't leave my husband sitting there alone for too long.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.840
Okay, now how about listening to how
ending a conversation works in real life?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.320
Let's listen to the end of a
conversation between two people chatting

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.050
at an office party.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:14.160
So you live here in the city then? Yeah
in Delgado 
Is that right? I've got a

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:22.470
cousin in that area. Pretty nice.
And convenient
Indeed lovely place.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.789
Well Shelly it's great to talk but I've got
to go and freshen up and find a table.

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:29.149
Maybe run into you later

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.600
So did you hear how that worked?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.920
Amber said she needed to freshen up
which is a nice way for a woman to say

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:46.350
she needs to use the restroom. And she
started by saying "it's great to talk"

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:52.730
which we often used to indicate that the
conversation is coming to an end before

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.870
we give an excuse to leave.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.760
Now it's your turn to practice.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.840
We'll  repeat the dialogue but will beep out the end of the conversation.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.490
You can fill that in

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:12.079
yourself by saying it was nice to talk
and then giving any excuse to leave.

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:15.079
Ready? Here we go.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.660
Is that right? I've got a cousin in that area. Pretty nice. 
And convenient.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:43.319
All right! Now that we've looked at how
to end a conversation, it's time for us

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.680
to end this lesson.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.280
Besides learning how
to end a conversation we've looked at

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:56.300
some ways of keeping it going by showing
interest or changing the subject

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:05.390
We'll be back soon with another 925
English lesson. Until then so long and

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.090
happy learning!
