00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.400
You're learning with Nine to Five
English - business english for the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.040
workplace.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.800
Hi Tim here with another nine to five
english lesson. Today we're going to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.400
learn some expressions
for answering the phone in english.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.280
using the telephone is an important part
of business

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.800
but the way we communicate is a little
different from

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.239
in-person conversations. We have some
special expressions

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.120
we use to answer the phone ask for
clarification

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.680
and get a call back. At the start of a
phone call

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.840
it's a good idea to make sure the other
person knows

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.359
who you are. You can identify yourself
in a few different ways. Besides saying

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.960
my name is, we often use the expression
this is before our name.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.640
But don't try to use this expression in
person.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.200
i only say this is Tim when i'm
talking on the phone. Let's practice

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.280
identifying ourselves at the start of a
phone call.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.000
Listen to each example then repeat it
for yourself. Ready? Let's get started!

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.079
Hi there this is jason locke calling

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.840
from Milton Enterprises.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:54.320
Oh hello my name's Wendy chambers with BMA Bank.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.479
Good morning Dirk here. How can i help?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.840
Hello Francine speaking.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.760
As you can hear we identify ourselves
not only when we call someone else

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.520
but also when we answer the phone
to do that we just say something simple

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.760
like Tim here or tim speaking
now because we only have a person's

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.519
voice on the phone
there's a higher chance we don't

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.879
understand something
it might be a single word or a whole

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.959
sentence that isn't clear
in this situation you need to ask

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:57.440
for clarification you might ask
could you repeat that or what was that

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.800
or you might simply say that you didn't
catch something which means you didn't

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.040
hear correctly let's try some examples
of

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.200
asking for clarification remember
to repeat the examples after you hear

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.480
them
sorry what was that

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:37.120
could you repeat that last part again
sorry did you say 14 or 40.

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.840
i'm sorry i didn't catch that

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:56.879
one very important word you heard
several times in those examples is

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.560
sorry that word helps make our requests
more polite

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.959
you also heard an example of asking for
clarification

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.120
between two similar words
in this case you just ask

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.160
did you say x or y
another common situation is when you

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.880
need to talk about
calling someone back maybe you called a

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.880
business
to talk to someone who's not there or

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.320
maybe someone called your business to
talk to someone who's not in

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.520
in any case we need to arrange
a callback polite ways to arrange a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.320
callback
often use the expressions could you

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.199
or would you for example
you might say could you ask john to call

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.680
me back
or would you like tom to call you back

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.160
later and sometimes
it's you who has to call someone back

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.720
because you're busy or have a poor
signal in that case you might

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.960
ask would you mind if i called you back
let's try some practice with asking for

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.919
a callback using these expressions
once again repeat the examples after you

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.320
hear them
could you have dave call me back at this

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.639
number

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.600
would you like me to ask mary to return
your call

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.320
please have charlie call me when he's

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.840
available

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.160
would you mind if i called you back in
15 minutes

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.080
one useful expression that we just heard
is to have someone do something

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.440
that is you can say i will have greg
call you back tomorrow that just means

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.840
you are asking greg to call the person
back

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.080
okay so we've practiced some useful
expressions

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.440
but how do these sound in a conversation
let's listen to a short dialogue between

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.160
carly and bob bob is calling carly's
office

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.520
to talk with ginny schwartz but jenny
isn't there let's listen

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.840
hello ace business machines
hi this is bob turner may i speak with

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.319
jenny schwartz
sorry but jenny's not in the office

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.160
right now
okay could you have her call me back

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.479
please

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.599
does that make sense bob identifies
himself

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:15.599
and asks to speak with ginny schwartz
when carly tells him ginny's out of the

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:21.120
office
bob asks her to have jenny call him back

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.599
now it's your turn to practice we'll
repeat the dialogue

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:30.639
but this time we're going to beep out
the second speaker's words

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.720
you will have to say those parts
yourself

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.720
remember to identify yourself as bob
turner and ask to speak with ginny

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.039
schwartz
then you'll politely ask carly to have

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:50.400
ginny call you back
ready here we go

00:07:50.400 --> 00:08:01.919
hello ace business machines
sorry but jenny's not in the office

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:06.820
right now

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.800
all right that's all for this lesson
we've learned some great ways to

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.440
identify yourself
on the phone ask for clarification

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.080
and talk about calling someone back
we'll be back soon with some more useful

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:36.399
english expressions until then
so long and happy learning
