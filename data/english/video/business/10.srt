You're learning with nine to five
English.  Business English for the workplace.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.710
Hi Tim here with another 9 to
5 English lesson. In our last two lessons

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.119
we looked at how to talk about your job
and your work. Today we're going to learn

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.680
how to talk about your company. Anytime
you talk about your work you're probably

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.600
also going to talk about your company so
what exactly do we talk about what are

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.140
the important aspects of your company
that might be interesting to people?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.960
Well to begin with you can talk about what your company actually does. That's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.420
probably the most important piece of
information and when we talk about what

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.080
our company does
we usually say "we" because that shows

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.229
that we're a part of the company
it's also a good idea to use a strong

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:26.340
verb like manufacture or develop or you
can say what kind of company it is such

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.700
as a manufacturer and finally you might
want to mention what industry or field

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.060
your company works in all of that
information will give people a good

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.899
sense of what your company does let's
practice some examples of talking about

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.329
your company in this way listen to each
example then repeat it yourself ready

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:05.119
let's get started we produce electric
motors for the automobile industry

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.650
we're an OEM manufacturer for the
computer industry

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.640
we develop software for the education
market

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.780
we make branded merchandise for small
businesses

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.580
there are lots of other great verbs you
can use depending on what kind of work

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.720
your company does you might use design
or sell or represent or distribute to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.620
describe the company's main activity so
that's how we explain what our company

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.610
does but what else can you mention about
your company well one thing you might

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.390
want to talk about is your company's
reputation that means how the public or

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.170
the industry think about the company you
might mention awards or distinctions

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.370
which show how great the company is or
you might say what your company is known

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.620
for and once again pay attention to the
verbs you choose let's try a little

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.889
practice talking about your company's
reputation once again I want you to

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:48.250
repeat the examples after you hear them
my company is known for its excellent

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.569
customer service

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.530
we have won several awards for our
advertising campaigns

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.060
we're seen as one of the major players
in our industry

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.709
our company is rated number one for
safety and reliability

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.330
one thing you might have noticed in
those examples is what we call the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:42.069
passive voice that's when we say things
like is known for and are seen as and is

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:48.789
rated that's a useful way to talk about
reputation because it shows how the

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:56.080
company is generally seen or thought of
so besides what your company does and

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.259
its reputation another useful bit of
information is about your company's

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:09.750
customers to understand a company it
helps to know who its customers are and

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.529
how can you talk about that well there
are a couple of ways first you can use

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:25.870
an expression like we serve or we sell
to before mentioning the kinds of

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:34.389
customers you help or you can start with
our customers are and name the industry

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:41.050
or type of customer how about giving
this a try listen to the examples and

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.349
repeat what you hear we serve small and
medium sized businesses throughout

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.279
California

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.130
our customers are mainly in the
automobile market

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.990
we sell mostly to large retailers like
department stores

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.950
most of our customers are schools and
universities in Europe

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:31.479
okay so when we talk about our company
we mention what the company does its

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:38.680
reputation and its customers
now how does this information fit into a

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.879
normal conversation let's listen to a
short dialogue a woman is curious about

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:53.710
David's company let's hear what they
have to say so David what exactly does

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:00.849
your company do we make engines for farm
and construction equipment oh really

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:07.990
my brother's in construction I wonder if
he's heard of you yeah he probably has

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:15.789
we're a major player in the industry how
did that sound David started by

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:21.849
explaining what his company does then
when the woman wonders if her brother

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:28.599
knows about his company David mentions
its reputation by calling it a major

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:37.569
player that means it's an important or
large company in its industry now it's

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:43.509
your turn to practice will repeat the
dialogue but this time will beep out

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:49.659
David's words you'll have to say those
parts yourself remember start by

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:58.869
mentioning what the company does then

00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:02.610
