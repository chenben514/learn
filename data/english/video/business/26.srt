00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.660
You're learning with 925
English - Business English for the workplace.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.880
Hi Tim here with another
nine to five english lesson.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.680
Today we're going to learn how to give
instructions in english.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.960
Telling people what to do isn't just
something the boss does.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.480
Anytime you're helping someone with a
problem

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.040
training someone giving technical advice
or telling a colleague how to do

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.520
something
you're giving instructions.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.000
Of course it's very important to be
clear when you're giving instructions.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.079
And for that reason we sometimes explain things

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.559
step by step in a sequence
of instructions. This means

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.760
using words like first
secondly and thirdly.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.320
Or you might use other words like
next and at the end of your sequence

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.360
finally or lastly.
Let's practice some ways of using these

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.439
words
to give a sequence of instruction.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.479
Listen to each example then repeat it
for yourself

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.680
Ready let's get started.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.000
First try closing the program and opening it again.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.240
Secondly i'd like you to complete the
rest of the form.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.200
Next you'll have to choose a password.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.680
Finally don't forget to log out at the end of the session.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.840
So did those instructions sound like
orders i mean do you think

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.840
giving instructions means saying do this
and do that well

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.000
not exactly in fact in
english we don't like to be too direct

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.720
in most
situations that's why we say

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.080
can you try closing the program instead
of

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.239
close the program or
you'll have to choose a password instead

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.760
of just
choose a password one way to avoid being

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.159
too direct in
english is to use special words

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:14.640
called modals modals are words
such as can and need to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.720
and could and should
using modals is easy you just

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.360
put the modal between you and
the main verb for example

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.959
you might say first
you need to open an account

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.799
let's try some examples of giving
instructions

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:49.040
using modals. Remember to repeat the
examples after you hear them.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:00.319
You'll need to enter your username and
password to begin.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.239
Okay you can now open the app and create an account.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.840
Could you try restarting your device?

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:29.759
You need to start by launching the
program from the main menu.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:36.320
Did you notice that one example came
in the form of a question? that's an

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.880
extra polite way of telling someone to
do something.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.440
Not every modal can be used that way
however. Only can and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.840
could will work. For example,
could you check if your password is

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.639
correct
is just a nice way of saying check your

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.320
password is correct
you can also combine sequences

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.039
and modals to find the right balance
between being clear

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:16.240
and polite. But what if you're not
sure whether you've been clear enough?

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.080
What if you don't really know whether
the other person has understood?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.440
fortunately we have lots of different
ways of

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.080
checking understanding. And the best way is just to ask directly like

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.280
do you understand you might also
ask if people are clear or whether

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.120
everything makes sense these
are just different ways of asking if

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.880
something has been understood
let's try some practice with checking

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.919
understanding
using these expressions. Once again

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.639
repeat the examples after you hear them.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.060
So is everyone clear on what they have
to do?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.200
Okay do you understand how this works now?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.200
Does that make sense to you?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:35.840
Any questions about what you need to do?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.319
As you heard one other way to check
understanding is to ask if there are any

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.800
questions.
that way you can find out exactly what

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.900
people
don't understand.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.240
Okay, so we've practiced some useful ways of
giving instructions

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.800
and checking understanding. But what do
these expressions

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.840
sound like in a conversation?
Let's listen to a short dialogue between

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.080
Sean and Kim. Sean
has asked for help using a machine

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:21.360
and Kim is giving him instructions
on how to use it. Let's listen.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.920
Could you help me with this?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.600
Sure, first try turning the machine on.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.280
Okay i did that what's next?

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.120
Next you can turn the dial on the front to 50.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:47.840
Does that make sense? Kim begins by
instructing him to turn the machine on

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.800
then to turn the dial to 50.
She uses the sequence word next

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.280
and the modal can.
Now it's your turn to practice.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.039
We'll repeat the dialogue but this time
we're going to beep out the second

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:11.280
speaker's words.
You will have to say those parts

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.160
yourself.
Remember to say that first Sean

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.800
should turn the machine on then
say next and instruct

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.240
him to turn the dial on the front to 50.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.889
Could you help me with this?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.710
Okay i did that what's next?

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.800
All right that's all for this lesson.
We've learned some great ways to give

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.200
instructions
and to check understanding.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:07.780
We'll be back soon with some more
useful english expressions. Until then

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:15.040
so long and happy learning!
