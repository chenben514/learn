00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:15.140
You're learning with 925 English -
business English for the workplace.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:23.140
hi Tim here with another 925 English
lesson. In today's lesson we're going to

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.779
learn all about how to start a
conversation.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.920
Sometimes we call starting a
conversation breaking the ice. You can

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.640
think of the ice as that initial silence
between people. It could be between

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.590
strangers on a plane or co-workers in a
lunchroom and when we break the ice we

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.019
say something friendly to start a
conversation. So how do you do that?

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:04.519
What do you say and what topics our best? Well in our first lesson we had an example of

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.230
a greeting between work colleagues who
didn't know each other.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.590
Can you remember how they got their
conversation started after the greeting?

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.170
What did they say? Let's have another
listen to that short dialogue and you

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.450
can listen for the conversation starter.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.649
A pleasure Shelly quite the setup here
isn't it?

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.070
Yes, they have really gone to town. I
should get them to come decorate my

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.810
house. Yeah right good idea

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.259
So did you hear what the first person said? She said

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.630
quite the setup here isn't it and that
shows us that asking the question is a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.340
great way to start a conversation
especially if you've just been

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.509
introduced. You can use simple and direct
questions or you can use a comment with

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:11.060
the tag question. Just a quick note on
vocabulary here. The 'setup' of the room is

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.260
the way it is organized and decorated

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.520
And 'quiet the' means impressive so amber thinks the decoration of the room is very

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.980
impressive and Shelly agrees saying
they've really 'gone to town'. If we go to

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.880
town with something it means we make a
big effort.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.959
all right let's try a little practice
with some simple questions for starting

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:48.290
a conversation. Listen carefully to each
example then repeat the example yourself.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:59.530
ready let's get started can you believe
how much snow we're getting so where are

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.140
you off to today

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:12.340
you visiting family for the holiday or
just getting away

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.440
ok so those are examples of direct
questions about things like the weather

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.110
and travel these are pretty safe topics
for starting a conversation which is why

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.160
you might hear people use them so often
and you will also hear yes no questions

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:41.709
like can you believe and WH questions
like where are you going today killed

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:49.510
those are direct questions now how about
those tag questions I talked about first

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.810
what is that a question

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.989
well to make a tag question you make a
comment then had a little question at

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:07.660
the end for example you might say the
airport is quite busy isn't it or you

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.280
could say you work in sales don't you
let's do a little practice with this

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.959
kind of question remember repeat each
example after you hear it

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.460
a beautiful day isn't it

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:40.180
funded program do you think you were in
the afternoon workshop where you

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.420
now there are

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.550
are couple of tricks to tag questions
first

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.640
the question tag needs to match the
comment

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:57.480
so with a beautiful day you need isn't
it because the day is the it that with

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.540
you were in the morning workshop you
don't say isn't it instead we say we

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.890
weren't you the subject has to match and
the verb tits has to match and here's

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.540
the second thing about tag questions a
positive statement is followed by a

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.380
negative tag question like a nice day
isn't it

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.350
while a negative statement is followed
by a positive tag question like there

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.670
isn't much snow is there does that make
sense

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:42.230
ok so remember that little dialogue
between colleagues that we heard at the

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.930
start of the lesser let's use that for a
bit of practice will repeat the dialogue

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.470
but this time will be put out a couple
of lines so you can add your own

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.750
responses you need to start with the tag
question about the set up to get the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.810
conversation started and you'll have to
respond to the other person's comet

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:16.340
let's give it a go

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:30.240
yes they've really gone to town I should
get them to come decorate my house

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.539
showed that covers using questions to
break the ice we've practiced tag

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.380
questions and some simple direct
questions but sometimes the question

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.020
fields to direct doesn't it it might
even seem rude with someone we've never

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.819
met before so there's another way we can
start a conversation and that's with the

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.110
simple comment this is useful for
talking with strangers or someone you

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.560
haven't been introduced to what do I
mean by making a simple comment

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.680
all you do is say something about the
situation or place your in and the other

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.889
person can respond however they like
let's give it a try

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:25.190
will give you some good examples of
icebreaker comments you can listen and

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:33.110
repeat ready looks like they've got
quite the evening planned for us

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:44.780
you sure are a lot of people here
tonight looks like it's going to be a

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:50.270
full flight

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:56.650
sure is quiet in here today

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:03.560
seems simple enough doesn't it and maybe
you noticed the expression looks like

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.810
which is very useful for introducing a
comment and the words sure which is

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:18.000
useful for friendly emphasis it means
certainly like it certainly is a nice

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.480
day

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.770
but how does this kind of conversation
starter work in real life remember a

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.470
comment like this

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:33.560
invites a response from the other person
once they respond you can continue on

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.620
the same topic let's listen to a short
dialogue to see how this can work you'll

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:46.570
hear two travelers in an airport one of
them starts with the simple comet just

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:53.010
like we practiced then the other person
responds and the first person continues

00:08:53.010 --> 00:09:00.190
with some explanation of the situation
looks like it's really starting to fill

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:05.940
up yeah pretty busy I think everything's
kind of backed up something about a snow

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.450
storm in the Midwest angered

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:16.010
so did you hear how that weren't you
just comment on something around you let

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.730
the other person respond and keep
talking then the conversation flows from

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:29.690
there now you can try this yourself will
repeat the same dialogue but will be put

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.690
out the first and last lines it's your
job to break the ice with the comment

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:49.450
then continue talking after the other
person responds ready to give it a go

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:58.420
yeah pretty busy

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:04.910
okay now we've looked at starting the
conversation with strangers but how

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.000
about talking with your co-workers

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.139
well it's not too different from talking
with people you don't know you can use a

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:20.560
question or a comment and it's best to
pick an easy or general topic like

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:28.750
sports or the weather or news let's try
a little practice listen to each example

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.510
and repeat what you hear

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:43.290
ok let's begin can you believe this rain
we've been having did you see that race

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:49.620
last night did you hear about

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:56.150
the latest earthquake in Japan

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:04.310
the Euro sure seems to be in a bit of
trouble

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.270
so what do you think

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:13.490
this new guy who's running finance

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.410
we offer

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:19.430
ask these kinds of questions after we've
already said hello to the other person

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.470
but what if you haven't said hi or hello

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:31.029
well that's when you can use a word like
so or pay before your question just as a

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:38.199
way of introducing it well that pretty
much wraps it up for today we've

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:43.959
practiced starting a conversation with
questions after a greeting breaking the

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:49.339
ice with comments and starting
conversations with coworkers don't

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:54.910
forget to go back and practice these
techniques again and try using your own

00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:02.850
ideas in the examples will be back soon
with another 925 English lesson until

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.110
then so long and happy learning
