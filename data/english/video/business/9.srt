You're learning with 925 English -
business English for the workplace!

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:23.940
Hi Tim here with another 925 english
lesson. In today's lesson we're going to

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.930
learn how to talk about the work you do
in your job. Last time we looked at how

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.870
to talk about your job, which might
include stating your position and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.410
company and what you are responsible for,
But what if someone wants to know more

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.580
about what you actually do? For example
someone might ask what your daily

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.690
routine is like or they might ask about
your current or past projects. How can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.420
you describe these kinds of activities?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.119
Well let's start with talking about your
current work or projects by current. I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.630
mean things that are happening now. When
we talk about things happening right now,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.359
we normally say we are "doing" something.
You might use "we" if you mean your

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:31.799
company or team is working on something
or you might use "I" if you are talking

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.799
about just what you are doing.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.979
Let's practice some examples of talking
about your current work in this way.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.519
Listen to each example then repeated
yourself. Ready? Let's get started.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
We're busy designing a new housing development
in California.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.950
Right now, we're doing a big website
project.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
We're getting ready for a trade show.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.980
At the moment, I'm overseeing the
installation of a new machine.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.580
That's not too hard, right? And you'll
notice that it's always good to use

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:42.650
strong or specific verbs such as "design" 
and "oversee" when you talk about what you're doing.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.360
Now what if someone asks
you about what you've done in the past?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.920
Well to talk about your past work, it's
still a good idea to choose a strong

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.090
verb.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.109
Just remember to put it in the past
tense. But you don't need to say "was

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:09.650
doing." You can just use the simple form
"did" because it's completed.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.519
Let's try a little practice talking
about your past work. Just like last time

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.019
I want you to repeat the examples after
you hear them.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.940
I chaired the fundraising committee last year.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.210
I led the company's annual audit.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.940
My colleagues and I designed the new
elementary school in clifton.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.860
I used to work on site as an engineer
but now I've moved into management.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.880
One really useful expression you might
have noticed is "used to."

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.700
When there's an activity in the past that you did many
times or was ongoing

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.020
you can say you "used to" do it.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.600
Now what if someone wants to know your
current routine.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.410
I mean how you usually spend your time
during your workday.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.270
Well you can certainly use that exact
expression i just used. You can say you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.370
"spend" your time doing something or you
can say your work "involves" some type of

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.610
activity. And when you mentioned the
activity use the "-ing" form like "I spend a

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.640
lot of time writing reports."

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.950
Let's practice talking about your daily
routine with a few examples.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.680
Once again, repeat what you hear.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.880
I spend a lot of time answering the
phone and emails.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:23.640
My work involves talking with customers
and solving technical problems.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:33.309
I put in a lot of time visiting
customers every day.

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:41.609
Most of my day is spent calling clients
and handling orders.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.320
So that's how we talk about our daily
routines but how might this sound in a

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.410
real-life conversation? Let's listen to a
short conversation between two people

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:06.090
who have just met. The first person is
asking the other person, John, about his

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.570
work. Listen to how John answers the questions.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.060
So do you guys have any new projects on

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.440
at the moment?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.130
Actually, we've just started work on a
new factory.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.080
You must be busy what's your day-to-day
routine like?

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.140
Most of my day is spent testing new machines and checking on
deliveries.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.660
Can you hear how this works? John is asked
about new project, so he mentioned

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.160
something his company has just started
and when he is asked about his

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:51.480
day-to-day routine he explains how his
day is spent. And notice those verbs

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:59.880
"testing" and "checking on." Now it's your
turn to practice. We'll repeat the

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:06.300
dialogue but this time we're going to beep
out the second speakers words. You will

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.150
have to say those parts yourself.
Remember to start by mentioning your

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:20.550
current work then you'll talk about your
daily routine.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.550
So do you guys have any new projects on at the moment?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.600
You must be busy! What's your day-to-day routine like?

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.500
So now you've practiced talking about
your work. But another part of talking

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:54.570
about your job, involves talking about
your company. You'll have to tune in to

00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:02.910
our next lesson to learn how to do that.
Until then, so long and happy learning!
