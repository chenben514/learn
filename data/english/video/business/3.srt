You're listening to the Business English
podcast for professionals on the move.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.289
Welcome back to Business English pod
today's show is the second part of a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.230
two-part series on making rejecting an
accepting suggestions. In the first

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.089
lesson you practiced making suggestions.
In this episode will look at appropriate

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:40.239
ways to reject and accept suggestions. As
you remember the listening takes place

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.000
in a sport shoe company called stratus.
We'll be listening to Karen marketing

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.879
manager meet with three members of her
team, Charles, Sven and Miguel. They are

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.729
choosing a celebrity spokesperson for a
new product. Celebrity means the famous

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.330
person.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.410
Here, spokesperson is someone who gets paid to
be in an advertisement for a product.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.680
Okay, as you listen pay attention to how the speakers accept or reject each other

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
suggestions.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.200
okay now let's talk about who we want to
use as a spokesperson for this product

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.840
let's go around the table so we use a
sports star or someone else and what do

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.810
you think well one possibility would be
to use the famous overweight business

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.840
executive for CEO someone who is really
successful sorry can I come in here

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.720
yes go ahead McGill that's a good idea
but I'm not sure it would work for one

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.090
thing our customers want to be fit not
fat

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.120
well then what do you suggest perhaps we
should just use a famous sports star

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.090
what we usually do if it isn't broken
don't fix it you know what I mean we

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.910
could try getting really good suggestion
but I can see one or two problems with

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.160
that to be honest first off target
markets are in the UK and the USA we

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.180
need someone who both Americans and
Britons really like secondly a target

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.620
customer is kind of special I've got a
suggestion

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.850
go ahead child is just like did but how
about choosing someone from the sport

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.920
was normal to be heavy american football
for example heavy but agile overweight

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.120
but strong and fast you know what I mean
right consumer what do others think yes

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.830
it might be worth trying

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.290
ok but what about the UK really good
reviews on this side of the Atlantic let

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.120
me think about this show we try to find
someone in golf that's popular in the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.870
USA and in the UK and that way we can
kill two birds with one stone to that

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.870
idea that I think this would try

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.440
here's another good idea let's tie the
dialogue to learn about accepting and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.640
rejecting suggestions

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.340
first we'll talk about rejecting
suggestions when rejecting suggestions

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.810
it's important to avoid hurting people's
feelings let's think back to Karen and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.870
her team and the dialogue during the
discussion what language do they used to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.510
reject suggestions they don't like first
listen to Miguel reject spends

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.670
suggestion sorry can I come in here

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.750
yes go ahead McGill that's a good idea
but I'm not sure it would work

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.760
Miguel interrupts politely can I come in
here then he says that's a good idea but

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.860
I'm not sure it would work

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.470
this is a good and caraway rejecting a
suggestion later Karen rejects Miguel

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.770
suggestion if it isn't broken don't fix
it you know what I mean we could try

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.850
getting really suggestion but I can see
one or two problems with that to be

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.480
honest karen's way of rejecting the
girls suggestion follows the same form

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.500
first she praises the idea

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.230
good suggestion then she politely
rejects it but I can see one or two

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.840
problems with that to be honest here
adding to be honest to the sentence

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.640
makes it even more polite you can add to
be honest to almost any rejection you

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.140
can also use frankly speaking or to be
frank the same way let's practice those

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.919
together good suggestion but frankly
speaking I can see one or two problems

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.919
with that

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.840
that's a good idea but I'm not sure it
would work to be frank

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.729
to reject suggestions you can also say

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.100
I'm not really sure about that

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.610
and

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.100
do you think so

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.360
so now you learn ways to make
suggestions on ways to reject

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.790
suggestions

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.790
next we'll look at ways to accept
suggestions

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.610
Karen and Miguel like Charles Justin
don't have Charles wants to use a sports

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:45.860
star who is heady but advil Advil means
quick and skilful was listen again it's

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.990
just like did but how about choosing
someone from the sport was normal to be

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.690
happy american football for example
heavy but agile overweight but strong

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:05.350
and fast you know what i mean consumers
you may want to have a think yes it

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.990
might be worth trying right I can see
what you mean and yes it might be worth

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.920
trying

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.270
are two ways to accept suggestions what
else can you say ok let's do that

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.790
not a bad idea

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.190
yes

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.190
that would work really well

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.009
good idea

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.820
great idea

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:42.520
ok so today you've learned many ways to
reject and accept suggestions now before

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.270
we finish today's show let's look at an
Indian Karen uses at the end of the

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:55.040
listing let me think about this show we
try to find someone in golf that's

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.620
popular in the USA and in the UK and
that way we can kill two birds with one

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.390
stone to kill two birds with one stone
is an idiom that means to do or

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:12.230
accomplish two things at one time you
can say that way we kill two birds with

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.950
one stone or that will let us kill two
birds with one stone for example

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:25.050
what if I find one person to do both
child and McGill's jobs that will get us

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.050
killed two birds with one stone

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:38.180
now let's practice what we learn first
let's go over rejecting suggestions

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.350
politely you'll hear a series of
suggestions

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.340
each followed by a beat after each beep
use a polite phrase to reject the

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:53.630
suggestion for example if you hear what
if we cut the sales training budget you

00:07:53.630 --> 00:08:00.020
can say well I can see one or two
problems with that idea for well I don't

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.230
know are you ready let's give it a try

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.990
what if we hold the meeting next week

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.480
I think we should buy new computers

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.390
tried to hold the training in a pub

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:39.919
how'd you do listen to some examples to
check your answers What if we hold the

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.670
meeting next week

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.220
that's a good idea but I'm not sure that
we want it

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.150
I think we should buy new computers

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.020
do you really think so I'm not so sure
about that

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.080
let's try to hold the training in a pub

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.940
and Sir frankly speaking I can see one
or two problems with that idea

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:14.749
now let's practice accepting suggestions
after each beep use a phrase to accept

00:09:14.749 --> 00:09:21.669
the suggestion like okay let's do that
or that's not a bad idea how about we

00:09:21.669 --> 00:09:24.669
all go on an outing together next
weekend

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.070
what if we hold a party to increase
morrow

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.980
we're wasting a lot of time is there any
way we can hold fewer meetings

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.460
how did you do listen to some examples
to check your answers

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:01.889
how about we all go on an outing
together next weekend

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.130
and Sir great idea

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.059
what if we hold a party to increase
morrow

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:14.179
on so yes I think that would work really
well

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:20.060
we're wasting a lot of time is there any
way we can hold fewer meetings

00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:24.209
answer that's not a bad idea

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.310
it's always a good idea to go back and
practice again this time substitute

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.310
different language to build fluency

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.699
in this unit we've learned appropriate
ways to accept and reject suggestions

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.319
we've also reviewed usefully idioms
thank you for listening
