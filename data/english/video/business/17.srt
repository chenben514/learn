00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.429
You're learning with nine to five English,  business English for the workplace

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.760
Hi Tim here with another

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.430
nine-to-five English lesson

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.259
In today's lesson. We're going to learn how to ask for and give directions

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.979
It would be great if the map apps on our phones were perfect but

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.709
even with the help of technology we can get confused in a new city a new neighborhood or a

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.079
new office building and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.609
When we do we need to be able to ask for help

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:00.089
One simple way to ask for directions is to ask if someone knows where something is

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.359
Or you can just say that you're looking for a certain place

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.070
Whether it's a building or a room inside a building

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.610
One other polite way to ask for directions is with the expression

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.450
Could you tell me how to get to a place?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.899
Why don't we try some of these expressions for asking for directions

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.379
Listen to each example then repeat it for yourself ready. Let's get started

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.699
Could you tell me how to get to the library

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.700
Do you know where the Omega Hotel is

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.429
Sorry, I'm looking for the meeting room

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.680
What's the best way to get to the nearest subway station

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.920
As

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.050
You heard sometimes you don't know exactly

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.430
Where you're going?

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.709
That you need a certain kind of place like a subway station in that case

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.550
We often ask for the nearest one

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.890
Now there are actually two kinds of questions

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.750
Here if you ask someone the best way to get somewhere you're looking for directions

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.980
If you ask where is a place you're asking for?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.949
Location you need to be able to answer both kinds of questions

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.149
Giving directions is pretty simple

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.200
You can just tell the person where to go using expressions like go straight

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.660
turn right or

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.410
Turn left

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.700
Then you mentioned the street the person is to go straight on or where they should turn

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.190
let's give these expressions a try remember to repeat the examples after you hear them just

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.860
Head straight down Burnett Avenue for about 200 meters

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.549
Turn right when you come to the Royal Bank

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.819
Take a left on Westside road

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.250
You'll have to go up a floor and then down the hall

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.520
You might have noticed a couple of other verbs that we use to give directions

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.630
First you might tell someone to head in a certain direction in this

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.350
situation head just means go

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.900
the other verb we use

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.420
instead of turn left or right

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.380
is

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.380
Take a left or right

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.380
All right, that's directions. What about location?

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.259
How can you tell someone exactly?

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.140
where something is

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.570
Well in that case you need some location words

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.840
like a cross from to the left of at the corner and

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.640
between

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.469
We use these expressions to describe where something is in relation to something else

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.710
Let's practice these expressions and you'll see what I mean about

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.830
Describing location. Once again, repeat the examples you hear

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.089
It's right across from the Nike store

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.550
It's just to the left of the cafeteria

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.580
It's at the corner of 5th and Kings way

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.440
It's between sprout cafe and the Korean restaurant

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.408
Can you see how that works now

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.759
one thing that can be confusing is when we say right across from

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.039
That doesn't mean right as in turn right or left

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:18.129
it means

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.688
Directly across from something not a little to one side

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.539
but directly across from

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.519
Okay, we've practiced some useful expressions

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.539
now

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:38.289
Let's hear how this sounds in a conversation. Let's listen to a short dialogue

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.789
between Tim and

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.020
Zahra

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.710
Tim is asking for directions to a place

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:47.240
Called the Cascade

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.359
Building let's listen

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.218
Could you tell me how to get to the Cascade building

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.869
Sure, just head straight down Ellis Street for 100 meters

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.000
Thanks, and is it on the left or the right of the street

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.378
It's on the left right across from the subway station

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.730
Pretty simple, right

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.320
Zara uses one expression for giving directions and

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.490
Another for describing the location of the building

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.730
Now it's your turn to practice

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.770
Will repeat the dialogue but this time we're going to beep out the second speakers words

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.099
You will have to say those parts yourself

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:45.529
Remember to tell Tim to head straight down Ellis Street for 100 meters

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.969
Then tell him that the building is right across from the subway station

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.739
Could you tell me how to get to the Cascade building

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.349
Thanks, and is it on the left or the right of the street

00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:20.938
All right that about does it for this lesson

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:26.518
we've learned some great ways to ask for and give

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:29.219
directions until

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:33.328
Next time so long and happy learning
