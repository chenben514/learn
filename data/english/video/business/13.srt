00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:08.518
You're learning with nine to five English - business English for the workplace

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.069
Hi, Tim here with another [9] to [5] English lesson in

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.039
Today's lesson we're going to learn how to disagree with ideas

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.520
people disagree with each other's ideas all the [time] in fact

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.700
Disagreement isn't just natural

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.540
it's

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.710
necessary

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.899
How else can we sort out the good ideas from the bad ones?

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.120
But disagreeing with people isn't always easy

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.360
If you're not [careful], you [can] make people feel hurt or angry

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:03.329
So how can you do that? How can you tell someone you don't like their idea without upsetting them

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:11.519
well one thing you can do is avoid stating your disagreement too strongly for

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.430
Example you can say I'm not sure that's a good [idea]

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.040
What you're really saying is that it is not a good idea

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.900
But it's softer if you sound a bit unsure

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.990
the word might

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.950
Can work this way as well as in that

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.579
might not be the best way to go and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Notice that both these ways of disagreeing

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.229
focus on the idea

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.779
Not the person presenting the idea

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.759
focusing on the idea can help reduce the [risk] of upsetting the person you're disagreeing with

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.600
Another way to carefully disagree with an idea is to use a special

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.349
expression that softens your words a

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.819
Couple of good ones are to be honest

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.380
and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380
I'm afraid

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.760
Starting a sentence with these expressions can [help] your disagreement sound more polite

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.589
How about practicing these different ways to disagree?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.709
You're going to hear some [examples]

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.450
after each example

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.509
try repeating it yourself

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.709
ready

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.709
Let's give it a go

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.099
I'm

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.759
Not sure that's the best option here

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.330
I'm afraid I don't totally agree with you

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.289
To be honest, I [think] that would be difficult

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.800
Well that might not be the best way to go

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.269
So we've [just] practiced some simple ways of disagreeing carefully

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.249
but there's another really effective way to disagree, and that's what I call the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.810
yes, but

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.640
approach

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.080
with the yes, but approach you actually start by agreeing or

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.130
Saying something good about the idea

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.269
then you use the word but

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.820
To introduce your disagreement or the reason why you disagree?

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.969
for example you might say

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.289
good idea, but we don't have enough time or

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.760
you could say

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.089
Yes this option is cheaper, but it doesn't look very nice

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.119
Why is this yes, but approach effective?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.649
Well it shows that you [have] an open mind

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.109
[I] mean if you can say something good about the person's idea

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.070
Then you've clearly thought carefully about it

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.320
You're not just disagreeing to be difficult or to start an argument

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.850
Now it's your turn to practice using the yes, but approach

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.310
Remember to repeat each example after you hear it

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.100
Good idea, but nobody has the time [to] make it happen

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.019
I see what you're saying, but I'm not sure I can agree

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.359
Although it costs less. I really don't think it's as good

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.529
okay, so we've practiced some different ways of

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.350
disagreeing carefully

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.679
But sometimes you don't want to be careful

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.430
sometimes

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.260
You want to make it very clear that you disagree?

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.089
And you're not worried about making someone feel bad in

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.440
This situation you can say what you think?

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.319
very directly and clearly

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.410
for example you might say

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.589
that's out of the question or

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.979
There's no way we could do that

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.380
Both of these expressions mean that something is impossible

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.709
Another way to disagree. Strongly is to ask a question like

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.679
Do you really think that would work?

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.830
What you really mean is

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.510
That won't work

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.260
But by asking a question like this

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:30.519
It makes it sound as if you're surprised that someone might actually believe it's a good idea

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.799
One more way of disagreeing. Strongly is to tell someone they must be kidding or

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:46.299
Joking of course the person isn't really joking but saying this

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.450
Makes it sound like their idea is terrible

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.049
Now let's practice these expressions

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.530
for disagreeing strongly

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.509
Once again repeat [the] examples after you hear them

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.619
Do you really think that would work?

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.419
That's out of the question

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.270
There's no way we could do that

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.020
You've got to be kidding

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.519
so we've learned some different ways of

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.070
disagreeing with ideas

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.339
but how do these expressions sound in the

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.180
conversation

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.790
Let's listen to a short dialogue between two co-workers

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:54.089
They're talking about whether or not they [should] hire a person named Jill

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.029
Okay, it's clear to me that we [should] hire Jill

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.480
I'm afraid I don't totally agree with that

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:12.420
Well, she's got a lot of experience. I know experience is important, but she's not a good fit

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.580
as you

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.239
[heard] the man disagrees carefully with the idea of hiring Jill

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:29.160
then when the woman mentions Jill's experience the man starts by acknowledging that

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:35.729
experience is important before he disagrees by using the word but

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.479
Now it's your turn to practice

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:47.250
Will repeat the dialogue, but this time we're going to beep out the second speaker's words

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.089
You will have to say those parts yourself

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.900
remember to start by disagreeing

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.800
carefully

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.839
Then you can use a yes, but approach to comment on Jill's experience

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.479
Okay, it's clear to me [that] we should hire Jill

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.659
Well, she's got a lot of experience

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.359
all right, we've learned some great ways to

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.570
disagree with people's ideas

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.280
carefully, and

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.840
we've also

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.489
practiced disagreeing strongly with ideas

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:50.529
Be sure to tune in next time when [we'll] start learning how to talk about your personal background

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.629
until then so long and happy learning
