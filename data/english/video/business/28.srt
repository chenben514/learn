You're learning with nine to five
English. Business English for the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.120
workplace.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.760
Hi Tim here with another
nine to five english lesson

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.840
In today's lesson we're going to learn
how to end a phone call in english.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.320
last time we looked at lots of useful
expressions

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.480
for answering the phone and starting a
call

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.200
but what about ending a call?
if you finished your conversation what

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.920
can you say
to end the call politely

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.520
well for starters one thing you want to
avoid is just suddenly saying

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.479
goodbye to end a business call
professionally there are three simple

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.640
steps
to follow first you signal

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.200
that you want to end secondly
you review your action points

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.560
and finally you say goodbye
now signaling that you want to end a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.080
call
often starts with a word like well

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.840
so or okay
these words show that you want to change

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.759
the subject then you can thank the
person

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.240
and say you need to go or
make a general comment let's

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.640
practice some of these ways of showing
that you want to end a call listen

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:02.320
to each example then repeat it
for yourself ready let's get started

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.840
well i should probably get going

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.239
it's been great to chat

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.840
so thanks for all the information

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.160
okay i've got to run here

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.680
as you can hear these types of comments
signal an end to the conversation

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.599
you might have noticed two different
expressions

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.959
that mean you have to leave a situation
first was i should probably get

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.599
going and the second was
i've got to run these are just

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:08.400
friendly ways of saying i need to leave.
now a business call is like a little

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.840
meeting
so the second step in ending a call

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.959
is reviewing the actions you've
discussed often

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.319
this means stating what you will do next
like i'll send you the file tomorrow

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.440
and if you want to confirm what the
other

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.319
person will do or what you'll both do
you can turn your statement into a

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.760
question
using a tag that might sound like

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.400
so you'll review the proposal next week
right let's try some

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.760
other examples of reviewing next
steps remember to repeat the examples

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.959
after you hear them

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.280
so i'll send you that file tomorrow and
you can let me know what you think

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.840
all right so we'll be chatting again
next week right

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.440
i'll have that package sent off right
away

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.840
i'll look out for your email later today

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.759
one expression you might have noticed
there

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:47.600
is isle or i will
have that package sent off for example

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.520
what does it mean to have something done
it means you make sure the thing

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.080
is done it might be you
it might be someone else but you will

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.199
make sure
it's done all right

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.039
so you've signaled that you want to end
the call

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.840
and you've reviewed next steps
now you're ready to sign off

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.880
or say goodbye there are many ways to
say goodbye

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.520
in english you can wish someone
a great day or a

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.720
good weekend or good luck
with something and we often say

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.759
take care or mention when we'll talk
again

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.199
let's practice some more ways to sign
off

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:53.360
at the end of a call once again
repeat the examples after you hear them

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.199
have a great day bye now

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:07.840

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.039
all right then have a good weekend

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.840
good luck with your presentation

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.680
did you hear that expression by now
you might also hear people say bye for

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.160
now
or maybe by then

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.280
these are just common and friendly ways
of saying goodbye so

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:52.800
we've practiced some useful expressions
but how do these sound in a conversation

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.880
let's listen to a short dialogue between
mark

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.840
and leslie both people are signaling
they want to end the conversation

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.800
and using expressions to sign off
let's listen

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.599
well i hope your interview goes well
thanks kevin it's been great to chat for

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.880

glad we could catch up all right then

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.000
have a good weekend

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:30.960
how did that sound leslie thanks
kevin for saying he hopes her interview

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.280
goes well
then she makes a comment about their

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.160
conversation
mark responds with his own comment and

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.960
leslie signs off by wishing him
a good weekend now

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.680
it's your turn to practice we'll repeat
the dialogue

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.440
but this time we're going to beep out
the second speaker's words

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.199
you will have to say those parts
yourself

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:08.400
remember to thank kevin and say
it's been great to chat then

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.039
you'll wish him a good weekend
after using the expression all right

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.280
then

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:27.840
well i hope your interview goes well

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:34.330
