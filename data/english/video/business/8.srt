00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:11.240
You're learning with nine to five
English. Business English for the workplace.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.200
Hi Tim here with another 9 to
5 English lesson.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.280
In today's lesson we're going to learn how to talk about your job.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.380
There are lots of situations where you meet someone

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.160
new and you want to tell them about your job.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.840
Maybe they ask you about it or you just
want to introduce yourself so how do you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.960
do that do you just say I am a Salesman
and that's it

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.460
No you need to say a bit more than that.
You can certainly start by saying what

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:06.420
your job is and you could use the job
name like salesperson or engineer or you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.850
could say you are in a certain field you
might also want to mention your position

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.250
so rather than just salesperson maybe
you're a regional sales rep and besides

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.329
your job or position it's a good idea to
say where you work I don't mean the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.890
location I mean the company or type of
company so you can name the company or

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.840
just say what kind of company it is
let's practice some examples of talking

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.280
about your job in this way listen to
each example then repeat it yourself

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.040
ready let's get started
I'm in sales with a large pharmaceutical

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:09.539
company I'm a senior engineer at fuller
associates

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.599
you

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.270
I work as a sales associate with city
insurance

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.530
I'm a marketing manager with BPT

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.690
I'm currently the accountant for a small
auto parts company

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.640
that was pretty straightforward wasn't
it as you heard we used the present

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.330
simple tense to state simple facts like
this so we just say I am an engineer or

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:05.000
use the short form I'm an engineer and
notice you can say you work with at or

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.819
for a company but is that all I mean if
you just mention your job and company

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:21.170
people won't always understand what you
actually do so you can tell people what

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.870
your main duties or responsibilities are
I don't mean a long list of duties I

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.880
mean what you mainly do and to talk
about our main duties we usually start

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:44.390
with I and a strong verbs such as
organize or handle or lead and whatever

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.260
you organize or handle or lead will be
extra information that helps your

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.519
listener understand your job that might
mean mentioning specific people or

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:05.510
places or activities let's practice
talking about your main duties once

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.950
again repeat the examples after you hear
them

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.940
I handle tax issues for our larger
clients

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.750
I take care of all the scheduling

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:34.210
I follow up with customers to make sure
they're satisfied with our service

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.930
I supervise our branches in the
southeast region

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:59.670
I head up the sales team all right so
that's how we talk about our main duties

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:07.500
but how does all this sound in real life
let's listen to a short dialogue between

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.670
two people meeting for the first time
the first person asks about the other

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:22.740
person's line of work which is like
asking what someone's job is nice to

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.520
meet you John so what line of work are
you in I'm in marketing with BT

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.870
industries oh is that right and what
kind of marketing do you do I handle all

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.790
our online and print advertising did you
hear how that worked the first person

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.090
asked about line of work
the second person started by saying he

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:59.070
is in marketing and names the company
the other person sounds interested so

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:07.110
the second person uses a strong verb to
talk about his main duties now it's your

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.870
turn to practice will repeat the
dialogue but this time we're going to

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:19.970
beep out the second speakers words you
will have to say those parts yourself

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.880
remember to start by mentioning the job
and the company then you'll give your

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.669
main duties here we go nice to meet you
John

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.250
so what line of work are you in

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:49.620
oh is that right
and what kind of marketing do you do

00:06:55.499 --> 00:07:03.099
so that's how we introduce our job to
someone of course sometimes we go into a

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:09.909
little more detail either about the work
we do or about the company we work for

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:17.129
and if you tune in to the next couple of
lessons that's exactly what you'll learn

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:23.459
until then so long and happy learning
