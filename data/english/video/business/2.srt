00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:31.720
and accepting suggestions reject means to say no&nbsp;
and accept means to say yes today we're focusing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.060
on making suggestions in the next episode we'll&nbsp;
look at accepting and rejecting suggestions this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.510
dialogue takes place at a sports shoe company&nbsp;
called Stratos you'll be listening to Karen a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.860
marketing manager meet with three members of her&nbsp;
team Charles spen and the go they're choosing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.830
celebrity spokesperson for a new product celebrity&nbsp;
means a famous person here spokesperson is someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.940
who gets paid to be in an advertisement for a&nbsp;
product in the dialogue target market is the place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.600
where you want to sell your product and target&nbsp;
consumer is the type of customer you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.960
sell your product to in this case the product is&nbsp;
a special kind of new sport shoe made especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.810
for overweight people overweight is a nice way&nbsp;
of saying too heavy or not fit okay let's listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.660
as you listen pay attention to the language the&nbsp;
speakers use to make suggestions to each other

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.380
okay now let's talk about who we want to use as&nbsp;
a spokesperson for this product let's go around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.200
the table shall we use a Sportster or someone else&nbsp;
spend what do you think well one possibility would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.940
be to use a famous overweight business executive&nbsp;
or CEO someone who is really successful sorry can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.680
I come in here yes go ahead Miguel that's a good&nbsp;
idea but I'm not sure it would work why not well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.290
for one thing our customers want to be fit not fat&nbsp;
well then what do you suggest perhaps we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.560
just use a famous sports star like we usually&nbsp;
do if it isn't broken don't fix it you know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.760
I mean we could try getting Rooney or Nadal good&nbsp;
suggestion but I can see one or two problems with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.280
that to be honest Oh first off our target markets&nbsp;
are in the UK and the US we need someone who both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.330
Americans and Britons really like secondly our&nbsp;
target customer is kind of special I've got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.570
suggestion go ahead Charles it's just an idea&nbsp;
but how about choosing someone from a sport&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:05.460
where it's normal to be heavy American football&nbsp;
for example heavy but agile overweight that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.440
strong and fast you know what I mean right I can&nbsp;
see what you mean what do others think yes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.100
might be worth trying okay but what about the&nbsp;
UK who are we going to use on this side of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.230
Atlantic hmm let me think about this shall we try&nbsp;
to find someone in golf that's popular in the US&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.350
and in the UK and that way we can kill two birds&nbsp;
with one stone that's what I do that idea yeah I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:45.300
think that's worth trying Karen's team had a lot&nbsp;
of ideas didn't they what language do they use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.730
to make their suggestions first listen to Sven&nbsp;
well one possibility would be to use a famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:03.990
overweight business or CEO someone who is really&nbsp;
successful how does men make a suggestion he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:13.290
one possibility would be to instead of will he&nbsp;
uses wood the use of wood here means it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:23.310
a suggestion past modal verbs should could might&nbsp;
and wood are often used like this in suggestions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.980
now listen to Miguel making a suggestion perhaps&nbsp;
we should just use a famous sports star like we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:39.930
usually do if it isn't broken don't fix it you&nbsp;
know what I mean perhaps we should is another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.520
polite way of making a suggestion notice the use&nbsp;
of just perhaps we should just use a famous sports&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.100
star this shows that what he's suggesting&nbsp;
is no change from the normal way of doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.890
things that's why he says if it isn't broken&nbsp;
don't fix it this is an idiom it means don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.980
change something if it's already working fine&nbsp;
in informal American oral English you can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:16.020
if it ain't broke don't fix it so far we have&nbsp;
two ways of making suggestions one possibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:26.130
would be to and perhaps we should now let's look&nbsp;
at a couple more ways to make suggestions listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:33.630
to Charles I've got a suggestion go ahead Charles&nbsp;
it's just an idea but how about choosing someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:41.460
from a sport where it's normal to be heavy first&nbsp;
Charles shows that he has a suggestion I've got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.360
suggestion then since he's talking to his boss&nbsp;
and perhaps since he's not sure everyone will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.840
agree with him he uses a careful polite way to&nbsp;
introduce the suggestion it's just an idea but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:03.030
how about how about is a normal way of making a&nbsp;
suggestion it's just an idea but makes it extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:11.650
polite instead of how about you can also say&nbsp;
about how about and what about our followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:21.430
a verb plus in ing how about washing the dishes&nbsp;
it's just an idea but what about eating lunch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:29.020
together these are sometimes followed by&nbsp;
a phrase or a sentence this is more common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:37.900
with how about how about you wash the dishes&nbsp;
and I dry how about we have lunch together

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.930
finally let's look at a couple more&nbsp;
ways of making a suggestion listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.800
to how Karin makes her suggestion shall&nbsp;
we try to find someone in golf you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:01.290
also say what if for example what if&nbsp;
we cut costs by finding a new office

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.410
now with Karen's team practice the ways&nbsp;
of making suggestions that we've learned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.940
so far well one possibility&nbsp;
would be to hire more staff

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.360
apps we should have more vacation

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.140
it's just an idea but how about&nbsp;
leaving a little bit early today

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.400
shall we try to look at this&nbsp;
from another point of view

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.860
well what if we try to open a new store in Germany

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:56.020
now it's your turn to talk in a moment you'll&nbsp;
hear a series of cues followed by a beep after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:03.250
each beat use the information supplied in the&nbsp;
queue to make a suggestion for example if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:11.080
hear get Beckham to sponsor the product you can&nbsp;
say well one possibility would be to get Beckham&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:21.270
to sponsor the product are you ready let's give&nbsp;
it a try launch the new product in q1 next year ah

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.000
open a branch in Slovenia

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:42.350
you give employees larger bonuses you

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.680
hold English training

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:57.780

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.290
scheduled weekly meetings to check on progress

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:04.900
you

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:17.690
how did you do listen to the examples to&nbsp;
check your answers remember there are many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:23.720
possible ways to respond to each question&nbsp;
launch the new product in q1 next year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.480
answer perhaps we should launch&nbsp;
the new product in q1 next year

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:39.980
open a branch in Slovenia answer it's just an&nbsp;
idea but what if we open a branch in Slovenia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.980
give employees larger bonuses

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.910
answer well what if we try to&nbsp;
give employees larger bonuses

00:09:52.330 --> 00:10:01.110
hold English training answer well one&nbsp;
possibility would be to hold English training

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.780
scheduled weekly meetings to check on progress

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.850
answer let's schedule weekly&nbsp;
meetings to check on progress

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.440
now that you've heard some examples go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.000
back and practice again substitute&nbsp;
different phrases to build fluency

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:35.083
that's all for this unit we've covered many&nbsp;
useful expressions for making suggestions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:41.940
in the next unit we'll use the same dialogue to&nbsp;
cover rejecting and accepting suggestions we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.980
also look closely at some idioms that were&nbsp;
used in the dialogue thanks for listening
