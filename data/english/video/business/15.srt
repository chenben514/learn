00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:12.420
You're learning with nine to five
English. Business English for the workplace.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.020
Hi Tim here with another
nine-to-five english lesson. In today's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.020
lesson we're going to learn how to talk
about your education. Your education is

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.840
an important part of your background and
there are lots of situations where you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.780
might talk about where you went to
school and what you studied. A job

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.559
interview is an obvious one but you
might also talk about your education in

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.399
casual conversation. The first thing you
might mention is where you went to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.969
school. More specifically people might be
interested in which university you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.930
attended. And there are several ways we
can tell them about that. Firstly you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:19.640
might just use that verb "attend"
Similarly you could say you "went to" or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.240
"graduated from" a certain University.
Another way to talk about your

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.210
university is to say that you're an alum
of a certain school. Alum is short for

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.479
alumnus which is a word that means a
person who attended a school. So for

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.270
example I might say I'm an alum of
Columbia University. Let's try practicing

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.000
some of this language. We're going to
give you some examples.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.299
After each example try repeating it
yourself. Ready? Let's give it a go!

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.039
I graduated from Yale in 2008.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.590
For my undergrad I went to the London
School of Economics.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.500
I attended a small Technical College in
Colorado.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.400
I'm an alum of Washington University.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.400
Ok we've practiced some different ways
of talking about our University.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.400
But another important aspect of your
education is what you studied. In English

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.560
we call your area of study your major.
This word can be used in a few different

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.459
ways. So for example if you studied
biology you could say that your major

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:25.019
was biology but you can also say that
you were a biology major so the noun

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.250
means both an area of study and a person who studies that area. We can also use

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.819
major as a verb such as I majored in
biology after you tell someone your

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:51.850
major you might also mention an area of
focus for example within business you

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:59.739
might have focused on finance or you
might mention your minor which is like

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:09.310
your secondary area of study and just as
we say we majored in a subject we can

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:18.039
say we minored in a subject there's
another much simpler way to talk about

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:25.590
your major and that's just to say
something like I studied biology of

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.160
course that's not the only course you
took but people understand that was your

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.660
major now there's one more way to tell
people what you studied and that's by

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.430
saying you have a degree in a certain
field your degree might be a master's

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.840
degree or a bachelor's degree and you
can use the short form of these

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:06.100
such as an MA or a BS which means
Bachelors of Science and is used for

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.720
degrees in technical fields such as
engineering or computers let's practice

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.590
some of these expressions for talking
about your major

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:25.750
once again you can repeat the examples
after you hear them I studied

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.510
international business with a focus on
finance

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.530
I majored in French with a minor in
political science

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.469
I started out as a science major but
switched to education

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.539
I have a Bachelor of
mechanical engineering

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.120
so we've learned some different ways of
talking about your University and your

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.780
major but how did these expressions
sound in a real conversation let's

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:27.599
listen to a short dialogue between Tanja
and Jose tanya is asking Jose about his

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:36.509
education so did you go to university
around here yeah I graduated from Iowa

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:43.560
State University in 2010 oh yeah great
school what did you study

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:53.039
I majored in business with a minor in
statistics as you just heard Jose says

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:01.229
he graduated from Iowa State University
and when asked about what he studied he

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:11.070
says he majored in business he also adds
that he had a minor in statistics now

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:18.270
it's your turn to practice will repeat
the dialogue but this time will be bout

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:25.080
the second speakers words you will have
to say those parts yourself remember

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:32.669
to start by saying that you graduated
from Iowa State University then you can

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:43.409
say that you majored in business and
minored in statistics so did you go to

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:49.439
university around here

00:07:53.169 --> 00:08:02.550
oh yeah great school what did you study

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.930
you

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:14.470
all right we've learned some great ways
to talk about your education including

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:21.520
what university you attended and what
you studied be sure to tune in next time

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:30.370
when we learn how to talk about your
career until then so long and happy
