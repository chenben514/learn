00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.060
Hi, Tim here with another 925 English lesson.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.150
Today we’re going to learn how to explain
a problem in English.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.610
Much of your work probably involves solving
problems.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.129
And sometimes we can’t do it alone.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.080
But cooperating with someone to solve a problem
means explaining it clearly.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.719
Before you explain the problem however, you’ll
need to ask for help.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:02.190
Two really useful words in this situation
are “would” and “could.”

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.750
These words help you make polite requests.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.690
For example, you might say “could you help
me?” or “would you help me with this?”

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.960
And we can add to these expressions to get
longer, even more polite expressions.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.590
Let’s practice some ways of asking for help
using “would” and “could.”

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.720
Listen to each example, then repeat it for
yourself.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.740
Ready?

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.930
Let’s get started.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:50.900
Do you think you could give us a hand
with this?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:00.240
Would you mind showing me how to do this?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.479
Could you help me with this?

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.500
I would appreciate a bit of help.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.400
As you heard, we can build a polite sentence
around “would” and “could, using questions

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.569
like “do you think you could” and “would
you mind.”

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.290
This is much more polite than giving people
direct orders, like “help me, please!”

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.530
Now, if someone agrees to help you, what do
you say next?

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.000
Do you start describing the problem in great
detail?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.040
Or do you think it would be better to say
generally what the problem is?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.099
Well, at the start, it’s good to be more
general.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.700
You can give a short overview of the problem
to give the person a general idea of what

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.219
it’s about.

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:14.659
Let’s try some examples of giving a general
statement about a problem.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.860
Remember to repeat the examples after you
hear them.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.600
It looks like there’s a safety issue
at the factory.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:39.530
We’ve got some problems with the website.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:49.230
I can’t seem to get the copier to work.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.609
 The security system isn’t working properly.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:04.409
Did you hear another word that has the same
meaning as “problem?”

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:11.230
The word is “issue,” as in “there’s
a safety issue.”

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:20.510
Or you could have a “technical issue,”
or a “security issue,” or a “staffing

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.280
issue.”

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.410
Also notice that a lot of problems are about
whether something “works.”

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.410
That just means whether it functions properly.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.130
Now, it’s not usually enough just to know
that there’s a problem.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:46.130
If we hope to solve it, we usually need to
know what happened to cause the problem or

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.610
make you think there was a problem.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.170
In this case, you need to tell a little story.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.860
And you should use the past tense to describe
what happened.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.600
For example, you might say “I turned the
computer on, but the screen was blank.”

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.860
Or you might say “X happened, when I did
Y.”

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.510
And at this point, you should be specific
and detailed about what happened.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.010
Let’s try some practice with describing
what happened using this approach.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.480
Once again, repeat the examples after you
hear them.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:43.680
The problem started when we made changes
to the homepage.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:54.610
So I tried to save the document to the
shared folder.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:03.910
The machine made a strange noise when
I turned it on.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:14.500
I opened the program, but I couldn’t
log in.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.940
Of course, explaining a problem clearly might
mean making several sentences like this to

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.870
describe the situation.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.810
And with a clear understanding of the situation,
hopefully the other person will be able to

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.460
help you solve it.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:41.550
Okay, so we’ve practiced lots of useful
examples for talking about problems.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.240
But how do these expressions sound in a conversation?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.130
Let’s listen to a short dialog between Kristi
and John.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.290
John is trying to describe a problem with
his website to Kristi.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.630
Let’s listen.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.090
Kristi: So what seems to be the problem?

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.660
John: It looks like there’s an issue with
the website.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.090
Kristi: Oh no, what’s going on?

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.990
John: Well, it started when I updated the
homepage.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.680
Simple enough, right?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.780
When Kristi asks about the problem, John says
there’s an “issue” with the website.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:36.220
And when Kristi asks for more detail, he explains
that it started when he updated the homepage.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.400
Now it’s your turn to practice.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:48.360
We’ll repeat the dialog, but this time we’re
going to beep out the second speaker’s words.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.370
You will have to say those parts yourself.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:08:00.510
Remember to say it looks like there’s an
issue with the website, then say it started

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.550
when you updated the homepage.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.850
Kristi: So what seems to be the problem?

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:12.970
John: It looks like there’s an issue with
the website.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.600
Kristi: Oh no, what’s going on?

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:24.790
John: Well, it started when I updated the
homepage.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.130
All right, that’s all for this lesson!

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:34.960
We’ve learned some great ways to ask for
help, make general statements about a problem,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.269
and describe what happened.

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:43.099
We’ll be back soon with some more useful
English expressions.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:46.989
Until then, so long and happy learning!
