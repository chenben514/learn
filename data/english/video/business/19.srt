00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:22.000
Hi, Tim here with another 925 English lesson.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.160
In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn
how to talk about possibility.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.890
What do I mean by “possibility?”

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.710
I mean answering questions like: will the
stock market go up?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.280
Will you get that job you applied for?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.329
Will your manager be in a good mood today?

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.930
Maybe?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.530
Probably?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.520
Or probably not?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.410
This is how we talk about possibility.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.370
Let’s start with “probably.”

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.690
That means you are pretty sure something will
happen.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.670
You’re not certain.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.950
It’s not 100%.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.900
But you can say you’re “fairly certain
that something will happen.”

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.740
That’s like saying it’s 80 or 90 percent.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.280
Another way of saying the same thing is “there’s
a really good chance.”

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.030
In that case, “chance” doesn’t mean
opportunity.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.700
It means “probability.”

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.299
How about a bit of practice with these expressions
for saying something will probably happen?

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.190
Listen to each example, then repeat it for
yourself.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.200
Ready?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.160
Let’s get started!

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:13.230
• Hiro will probably take the job at our
European office.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.300
• It seems likely that our marketing budget
will be approved.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.140
• There’s a 
really good chance we’ll beat our targets

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.480
this month.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:44.420
• I’m fairly certain that we’ll pass
the safety inspection.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.239
In one of those examples, we used the word
“likely.”

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:58.170
You can use this word just like “probably,”
so we can say something like “it will likely

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.209
rain.”

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.940
But it also works as an adjective.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.480
In other words, you can say that “rain is
likely.”

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.849
So, it can be used to mean both “probably”
and “probable.”

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.830
But what about when you’re not so sure?

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.510
What if there’s a fifty percent chance of
something happening.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.709
Maybe it will, maybe it won’t.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:41.349
Well, this is when helping verbs like “might,”
“may,” or “could” are useful.

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.580
For example, “I might get the job, but I’m
not sure.”

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:56.349
And if you think a fact might or might not
be true, you can say “it may be that”

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.569
something is true.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.850
For example, “it may be that we can’t
increase sales.”

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:11.220
That’s a way of saying “maybe we can increase
sales, but maybe we can’t.”

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.439
Let’s try these different ways of expressing
the idea of something maybe happening.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.620
Remember to repeat the examples after you
hear them.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:36.259
• Well, we might see a drop in sales next
month.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:46.679
• Judy could come by this afternoon, but
I’m not sure.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.060
• It may be that we need more office space
next year.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:05.760
• There’s a 50-50 chance we can get this
contract.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.379
Great work.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.909
And did you hear another “chance” expression?

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:19.759
This time, we said there’s a fifty-fifty
chance of something happening.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:28.770
In other words, there’s a 50% chance it
will, and a 50% chance it won’t.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.849
It’s “fifty-fifty.”

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:40.499
So we’ve talked about probably and maybe,
but what about probably not?

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:46.729
There are a few ways to say that you think
something probably won’t happen.

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:52.039
For one, you can say that you “doubt”
it will happen.

00:05:52.039 --> 00:06:00.729
To make it even less probable, you can say
you “seriously doubt” it will happen.

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:07.229
You might also say “I don’t think we can
count” on it happening.

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.509
That’s just like saying you doubt it will
happen.

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:21.819
We also have an adjective that is the opposite
of likely, and that’s “unlikely.”

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:29.509
And for extra emphasis, you can say something
is “highly unlikely.”

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:36.360
But here’s one tricky thing: you can say
“it will likely rain” but you can’t

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.770
say “it will unlikely rain.”

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:46.839
That word “unlikely” is only an adjective,
not an adverb.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:53.219
So you can say “rain is highly unlikely.”

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.800
How about some more practice?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.409
Let’s try these ways of saying “probably
not.”

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:08.509
Once again, repeat the examples after you
hear them.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:19.009
• I seriously doubt Dan will want to come
work for us.

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:28.720
• Finishing the project by May is highly
unlikely.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:37.000
• There’s very little chance that the
delivery will be here by noon.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:50.360
• I don’t think we can count on nice weather
for the event.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.129
Did you notice the “chance” expression
in those examples?

00:07:55.129 --> 00:08:02.009
This time, we said “there’s very little
chance” of something.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:08.050
That just means it probably won’t happen.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:16.189
All right, we’ve practiced some useful ways
of talking about possibility, but we should

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:20.479
really hear how this sounds in a conversation.

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:28.129
Let’s listen to a short dialog between Jane
and Robert.

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:35.099
They are talking about the possibility of
their company moving to another city.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.940
Let’s listen.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.080
Jane: I hear we might be moving to Chicago.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.399
Robert: Actually, I seriously doubt we’ll
do that.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.880
Jane: Oh really?

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.980
What have you heard?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.300
Robert: Well, it seems likely that we’ll
move to Cleveland instead.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.160
Can you hear the possibility expressions?

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:04.360
Jane starts by saying they “might” move
to Chicago.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.319
But Robert “seriously doubts” that will
happen.

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:17.260
Instead, he says it “seems likely” that
they’ll move to Cleveland.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.600
Now it’s your turn to practice.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:29.509
We’ll repeat the dialog, but this time we’re
going to beep out the second speaker’s words.

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:32.610
You have to say those parts yourself.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:40.060
Remember to start by saying you seriously
doubt what Jane says.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.540
Then say it seems likely you’ll move to
Cleveland.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.160
Ready?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.960
Here we go:

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.020
Jane: I hear we might be moving to Chicago.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.660
Robert: Actually, I seriously doubt we’ll
do that.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.160
Jane: Oh really?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.900
What have you heard?

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:09.580
Robert: Well, it seems likely that we’ll
move to Cleveland instead.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.020
All right, that’s all for today’s lesson!

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:21.160
We’ve learned some useful ways of talking
about possibility, and saying whether you

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.360
think something will happen or not.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.810
We’ll be back soon with some more useful
English expressions.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.110
Until then, so long and happy learning.
