Business Skills 360, the podcast that looks
at the other side of English.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:21.440
Hello and welcome back to the Skills 360 podcast.
I'm your host, Tim Simmons, and today I want

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.560
to finish up our series on English interview
skills.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.350
In previous lessons, we've gone over some
of the fundamental questions about who you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.399
are and what you've done. Today I want to
take a closer look at talking about your career

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.030
goals and researching prospective employers.
Interviewers don't just want to know whether

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.750
you've got the skills, personality, and qualifications.
They also want to know that you're a good

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.960
fit, and that they are a good fit for you.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.761
One important question you need to be ready
for in an interview in English is "why are

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:16.890
you leaving your current position?" This question
makes a lot of people squirm. But it's actually

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.290
an opportunity to talk about growth and change.
Nobody stays at the same job their entire

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.100
life. And this question isn't necessarily
fishing for problems in your past.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.140
What kinds of things can you talk about as
reasons for change? You might mention several

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.799
desires, such as the desire to learn, to take
on more responsibility, to enhance certain

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:59.490
skills, to relocate, to adjust your work-life
balance. All these are great reasons to change.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.979
Of course, if you were laid off, you need
to be candid about that. I'm not suggesting

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:14.569
you lie. Just that you keep your answer future-focused.
And that means not badmouthing your current

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.849
boss, colleagues, or workplace.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.169
Talking about why you're leaving your current
job will segue naturally to answering questions

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:35.029
about why you want this job. And the key here
is showing knowledge, suitability, and value.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:42.579
By knowledge, I mean you know something about
the company, its products, its reputation,

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:51.029
its culture, and its values. By suitability,
I mean that you jibe with the company and

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:59.430
the job fits with your career goals. And by
value, I mean that your skills and experience

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.730
will help you make a real contribution.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.659
Speaking of career goals, another common but
tough question during a job interview is "where

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:18.839
do you see yourself in five years?" With most
interview questions, I advise people to be

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:26.870
specific. But not this one. It's okay to state
very generally what your aspirations are.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.819
For example, you might say "I'd really like
to be involved with the strategic side of

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:40.579
things" or "I'd like to be taking on more
management responsibilities."

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.969
Whatever your answer, it should be possible
to achieve within the company where you're

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:55.279
applying. They're going to sink time, money,
and resources into you. They want to know

00:03:55.279 --> 00:04:03.359
it will pay off for them, not just you. So,
perhaps the worst thing you can say is "I

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.680
want to run my own business." The interviewer
will immediately think you're going to run

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.489
off with all their ideas!

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:20.120
One thing you'll notice is that most of my
suggestions require you to actually know something

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.259
about the company where you're applying. All
successful interviewees have done their homework

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:35.349
in this regard. You can start with the company
website, of course, but also check Google

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:42.509
for recent news stories and press releases.
Use LinkedIn to find out more about the company's

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:49.430
leaders and employees. And look through other
social media channels to get a more complete

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.699
understanding. The Glassdoor website can also
give you an inside look at company culture

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.949
- but don't get scared off by a few negative
reviews. Disgruntled people are often the

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.580
most vocal.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.841
Researching the company will also help generate
some good questions that you can ask. It's

00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:18.840
fairly standard at or near the end of a job
interview for the interviewer to turn the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.310
tables with a question like "Do you have any
questions for me?" The worst thing you can

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:33.689
do is to say something like "no, all good
thanks." That shows a troubling lack of interest.

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:41.340
So, what should you ask about? Here's a few
good ones. "How will you measure the success

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.719
of the person you hire?" "What are some of
the challenges the person in this position

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:54.080
will face?" "Can you describe a typical day
or week in the job?" "How would you describe

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.930
the culture here?" And probably one of the
best questions, because it gets to the heart

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.539
of what they're looking for, is "In the past,
what has differentiated the people who were

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.639
good at this job and those who were great?"

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:19.319
That final question will impress the interviewer
and give you a good idea if you really want

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:26.570
the position or not. After all, unless you're
really desperate, an interview is a two-way

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:35.069
street. You're both assessing whether you
and the job are a good match.

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:41.250
And as I've explained, you'll have to do that
by talking about why you are leaving your

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:49.520
current position, why you want this job, and
where you see yourself in the future. And

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.539
through it all, a solid understanding of the
company is just as important as an understanding

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.620
of English for job interviews.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.200
That's all for today.
