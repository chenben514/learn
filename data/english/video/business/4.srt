You're listening to business English Pod the business English podcast for professionals on the move.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.120
Welcome back to business English Pod

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.180
My name is Edwin and I'll be your host for this episode

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.389
In which we're going to take another look at one of our most popular and important podcasts

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.580
Today, we're talking about using the telephone. This is something we all do but we don't all do well

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.400
Talking on the telephone has become an extremely important part of business

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.169
You need to be able to answer a call professionally and create a good image of yourself and your company with only your voice

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Having effective telephone skills leaves a good impression on your customers clients and colleagues

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.449
People are busy, so you want to be very clear polite and organized in

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.599
This lesson we'll begin by looking at a bad example of answering a call and taking a message

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.960
We'll discuss. Why it's a bad example, and then we'll go into a good example of answering a call

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.360
[I'm] sure you'll see a clear difference

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.100
before we listen

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.720
Let's talk a bit about the basics of handling a call our tone of voice needs to be pleasant and positive

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.989
We don't want to make people feel like they are bothering us

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.449
Some people try smiling when they speak even though the other person can't see them this trick helps to maintain a good tone

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.009
Second we should always be prepared whether you're receiving or making a call you need to be ready

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.500
We also need to make it clear from the beginning who the person is talking to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.489
This means identifying ourselves and our company

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.099
From there we need to leave the conversation and find out how we can help the caller

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.399
the caller should not have to ask for help [and]

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.949
Finally we need to remember that listening is half of the conversation

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.239
We need to listen and respond to what the other person is saying

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.270
For our bad example. We'll listen as Justin an employee with drove, Esco calls a shipping company called Dane line

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.680
Just is hoping to speak with sylvie peterson, but it is a receptionist named amy who answers the phone?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.160
As you listen try to answer these questions

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.960
One how [would] you describe amy's attitude?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.010
To does Justin seem prepared

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.350
Hello, hi, who's this? Amy is this dane line? Yes? What can I do for you?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.340
Hi, yes

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.170
just a second there ah

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.399
There it is may I speak to Sylvie Peterson

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100
Sylvie

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.959
Sorry, she's not [here]. Can't leave a message sure go ahead um

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.240
Let's see my name is Justin Thomas. I'm with Travis co it's about the construction schedule for 2008 ah

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.889
And my number is wait a second 3 9 0 9 - 9 - 107

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.330
Sorry could you say [that] again? I'm looking for a pen which part all of it, okay

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.250
[what's] your [name]?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.610
This is not the way that a business telephone call should usually go neither amy or Justin did a very good job did they?

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.939
So what exactly is the problem? We know the basics of what makes a good call?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.730
So what is wrong with Amy and Justin?

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.639
Hello, hi, who's this? Amy is this dane line? Yes? What can I do for you?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.600
Let's begin with how amy answers the phone

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.820
She simply says hello that may be what you say when you answer your telephone at home, but it's not okay in a business setting

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.000
Amy doesn't say her name or her company's name. She also doesn't ask how she can help the caller and

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.280
Listen to her voice is it Pleasant does it make the caller feel good of the interaction?

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.930
Think about the impression this makes

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.739
Justin has to ask who is answering the call and make sure that it is actually the right company

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.859
Remember the person who answers the phone should make it clear who the person is calling?

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:59.419
Finally amy asks the caller what she can do

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.799
Hi, yes, just a second there

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.849
There it is may I speak to silby Peterson

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.550
Sylvie

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.698
Sorry, she's not [here]. Can't leave a message

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.929
Justin has to ask who is answering the call and make sure that it is actually the right company

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.889
He's really not prepared for this call and has to take a moment to figure out who he actually wants to speak with of

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.079
Course Amy should put Justin on hold while she looks for Sylvie Peterson

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.968
But she doesn't she just puts the phone down and calls out sylvie

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:41.689
Again, this is something [that] might happen at home, but should definitely not happen at work

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:49.699
notice too [that] it is Justin who asks if he can leave a message that something amy should have asked and

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.879
How does she handle it?

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.939
Sure, go ahead um

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:03.769
Let's see my name is Justin Thomas. I'm with Travis co it's about the construction schedule for 2008 [ah]

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:11.389
And my number is wait a second 3 9 0 9 - 9 - 107

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.278
Sorry could you say that again? I'm looking for a pen

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.080
Neither speaker is really prepared

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:28.520
Justin's not sure of his own number and amy doesn't have a pen handy even though she told Justin to go ahead with his message

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.560
Amy really needs to be better prepared and be a better listener

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.279
Now let's leave the bad example behind

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.239
You've seen quite clearly what we should not do

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:49.549
We'll listen to a good example of answering a call. This time. We'll hear mark rand who has replaced Justin

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:55.369
Mark is calling line and amy has obviously received some telephone training

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.340
As you listen try to answer these questions

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.880
One what information does amy include in her first sentence?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.220
- how does Mark Ran to introduce himself?

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:27.079
Hello, Daneline. This is amy. How may I help you hi. Amy my name is [Mark], [Rand]

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.609
I'm calling for Sylvie Peterson, just a moment, please all right

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.660
Thanks for holding

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.350
This sounds a lot different from the bad example doesn't it?

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:48.348
Mark and Amy accomplish as [much] in two lines as Justin and amy didn't six

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.519
First [amy] answered the phone very professionally

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.160
Hello, Daneline. This is amy. How may I help you

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.120
In this simple sentence [amy] has included the four important parts of answering the phone

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.780
the greeting her company name

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.980
her name and

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.990
an offer of help

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:17.509
The greeting doesn't always have to be hello. There are several other things you can say

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.199
Hello

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:23.389
Hi

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:25.729
Good morning

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.430
Good afternoon

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.220
Good day

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:37.549
Hi is slightly more informal than the others, but it is still acceptable in some contexts

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.450
Second you should say the name of your company

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:47.569
It's not really necessary to say this is before the name just the name is enough

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:55.969
You may also want to identify your department for example you can say sales department or just sales

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.510
Next say your name

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:07.859
Amy says this is amy notice that she doesn't say I am amy which is never used on the telephone and

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:16.109
Remember that we don't say this is in other situations like when we're answering a door or introducing [ourselves] face to face

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.519
How else can we say our name on the telephone?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.790
My name is Sebastian

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.939
This is Ray Turner

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:30.569
pat here

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.189
Finally you should make an offer to help like this

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.970
How can I help you?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
What can I do for you?

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:49.378
These are the four parts of a standard telephone greeting in North America in some situations

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:56.219
We might omit certain parts or leave them out for [example] if we know that this is an internal call

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.620
I mean from inside your own company, then you might just say your name and department

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:06.659
Still many companies expect the four part greeting at all times

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.380
And if you're not sure whether the call is external or internal

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.240
Remember that it's always better to be too formal than too informal

00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.079
Why don't we practice this four part greasing?

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:21.689
You will hear a prompt

00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:25.409
Use the ideas in the prompt to practice the four part greeting

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.649
morning Dave dixon construction help

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:48.659
Example answer good morning. This is Dave at [Dickson] construction. How can I help you?

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.209
Okay, what happens after [amy] answers the phone?

00:10:55.839 --> 00:11:00.328
Hi, Amy, my name is Mark Ran. I'm calling for Sylvie Peterson

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.009
Mark starts with a very nice personal greeting for Amy

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:12.089
Then he gives his own name if you are the caller, and you know the person you [are] calling you can use this is

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:18.869
But if we've never met before it's best to use my name is for your introduction in

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:24.119
This case you could also mention the company you work for but it's not necessary

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.529
Mark then states the purpose of his call he wants to talk to sylvie Peterson, and he uses the expression

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:33.829
I'm calling for

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:37.469
What are some other ways that we can ask for a person on the telephone?

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.430
may I speak to Benedict struck

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.540
His Arnold there

00:11:47.319 --> 00:11:50.219
Yes, I'm calling to speak to [Ravi] Montero

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:59.188
Now amy needs to check where the [sylvie] is available and to do this she puts mark on hold

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.610
Just a moment, please all right

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.800
There are a couple of other ways that amy could have done this

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.430
Could you hold please?

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.490
Would you mind holding please?

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.089
don't forget to actually listen for the caller's answer when you ask if the person can hold

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.709
Mark says all [right] and waits to find out whether Silvia is in and you'll have to wait as well
