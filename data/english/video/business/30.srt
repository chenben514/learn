00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.690
Hello and welcome back to the Skills 360 podcast.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.720
I’m your host, Tim Simmons,
and today I want to finish off our look at

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.840
the top 10 essential business English skills.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:26.260
In our last lesson, I focused on small talk
and English conversation skills such as expressing

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:34.070
opinions, asking questions, rejecting ideas,
and getting action.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.329
Of course, “conversation” is what comes
to mind when someone talks about language skills.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.100
But a lot of our English communication is
not conversation, per se.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.039
Your skill set has to include a lot more than
expressing opinions, agreeing, disagreeing,

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.049
and making small talk.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:05.820
Imagine for a second that you’re delivering
a presentation in English or conducting a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.750
training session.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.140
What kind of skills do you need in those situations?

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.150
Well, one thing you need to master is talking
about how something happens or how something

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.570
is done.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.659
By that I mean describing a process or giving
instructions.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:38.499
The key skill here is what we call sequencing,
or putting your ideas in a logical order and

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:42.490
making that order clear to your audience.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:51.579
To do this, you might use simple words like
“first,” “second,” “third,” “next,”

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.320
and “finally.”

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:03.109
But you might also use expressions like “at
this point,” “meanwhile,” and “subsequently.”

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:09.750
Using this kind of language helps you organize
your ideas, and you’ll be less likely to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.920
lose your audience.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.160
Connecting words aren’t limited to processes
and instructions.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.430
Adept English speakers will use all sorts
of words to connect their ideas and structure

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.280
a good argument.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.000
Think about proposing an idea to your boss.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.799
Will you rattle on and hope he picks up the
thread of what you’re trying to say?

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:44.120
Or will you present a cohesive and persuasive
argument using expressions like “because

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.580
of this,” “therefore,” “nevertheless,”
and “furthermore?”

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.830
Now I am not suggesting that you pepper your
speech with these kinds of words just to sound

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.830
intelligent.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.689
There’s a time and place for these formal
expressions.

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:11.170
But the importance of organizing your ideas
holds true in any situation.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.689
And in more casual circumstances, you can
simply rely more on simpler words like “and,”

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.690
“but,” and “so.”

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.549
Besides presentations or training, another
important situation with a special skill set

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.849
is bargaining, or negotiating in English.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.879
And I’m not just talking about high-level
talks on corporate partnerships or negotiating

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.620
a major business deal.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:54.320
Any situation that involves give and take,
cooperation, or compromise involves a kind

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.430
of bargaining.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.280
Maybe you and a colleague are trying to design
a website together.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.250
Or you and your boss are trying to figure
out a work schedule.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.659
Or you are trying to get two of your employees
to agree on a project budget.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:19.010
These are all situations that demand bargaining
skills.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.280
You need to acknowledge both sides and propose
trade-offs.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:34.520
Often this requires you to make conditional
sentences, using words like “if,” “unless,”

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.280
and “as long as.”

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.530
And if those statements are hypothetical,
you’ll have to make sure you get a handle

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.900
on important helping verbs like “would”
and “could.”

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:57.830
Okay, I’ve talked a lot today about organizing
your ideas, and about situations that require

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.110
clarity of information.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.580
This brings me to another essential skill:
summarizing.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.070
What happens after you’ve presented a clear
and logical argument, or you’ve negotiated

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.410
a compromise in a meeting?

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:23.040
Well, you need to ensure everyone can latch
on to the main ideas.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.880
That’s when you summarize.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.130
You might hear a summary introduced with expressions
like “to sum up,” or “let’s recap

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.050
briefly.”

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:44.910
But the real skill is figuring out what those
main ideas or points are and then stating

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.120
them concisely.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.990
You can’t repeat everything that was said
verbatim.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:59.120
You need to distill only what is essential
and paraphrase ideas appropriately.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.210
Now before I do exactly that with my own ideas
for this lesson, I’ve got one more essential

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.660
but challenging skill for you: speaking clearly.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.180
You probably know some people who seem to
just have a knack for clear speech.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.000
But it’s not just innate talent.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.400
You can learn to sound clear too, if you put
in the time and effort.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.310
So practice correct pronunciation.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.970
Try to enunciate clearly, even when it doesn’t
feel natural for your mouth to make certain

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.660
shapes or sounds.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.870
It gets easier with practice.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:52.320
But if you mumble, or don’t make the effort
to try to produce the right sounds and intonation,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:07:00.130
then it doesn’t matter what you say, because
people won’t be able to understand you.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.750
Now how about that summary?

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.690
I’ve covered five essential skills for every
ace English speaker.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:16.620
First, there’s the ability to present a
sequence or step-by-step instructions.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.610
Next is the skill of connecting your ideas
logically.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.440
Then there’s bargaining and summarizing.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.690
And finally, you need to work on your pronunciation
and intonation.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:52.750
That’s all for today.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.310
So long.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.389
And happy learning!
