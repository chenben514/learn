00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:10.780
business skills 360 the podcast that
looks at the other side of business English

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:18.180
hello and welcome back to the
skills 360 podcast I'm your host Tim

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.720
Simmons and today I want to look at how
to prepare for an interview in English

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.180
when I say prepare I'm not talking about
making an appointment at the hair salon

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.450
or picking out a clean shirt I'm talking
about doing some research anticipating

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:51.719
what you'll be asked and practicing how
to respond yeah I know I'm always going

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.320
on about preparation but this time it's
not just a suggestion it's essential if

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.720
you do it right you'll be able to head
into the interview feeling relaxed and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.330
confident and that will increase your
chances of landing the job now here's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.250
the thing most interviews cover the same
basic territory sure you might get a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.009
couple of curveballs but for the most
part you can predict what questions

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:37.049
you'll be asked and that means you can
plan your answers I don't mean script

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.970
your answers it's pretty tough to appear
authentic and natural while delivering a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.479
memorized response but you can outline
your answers and practice your delivery

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.229
so how do we go about doing that well
let's start by talking about how to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.239
introduce yourself in an interview in
English the old tell me about yourself

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.030
question it's a
amazing how many people are thrown by

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.940
this question or fumble through an
awkward response as they wait for the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.990
real interview questions but first
impressions are important and you need a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:36.440
good answer for tell me about yourself
my advice is to keep it succinct instead

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:46.040
of rambling on keep it professional but
show passion and keep it positive and if

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.980
you need a formula try present past
future how does that work check out this

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.130
example I'm currently a marketing
manager with a medium-sized software

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.900
firm since I was young I've loved
writing and design and all things tech

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.390
so in university marketing felt like the
perfect fit and I went straight from

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.150
college to IBM where I worked for five
years I'm happy with what I've

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.700
accomplished but I'm really looking for
a new challenge now and I love what you

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.690
guys are doing in that example you heard
me mention my current position my

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.640
educational and work background and the
change I want in the future if you

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.940
master your tell me about yourself
pitch you can practice responding to the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.690
next most common English interview
question what are your strengths first a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:03.350
don't don't give them a laundry list of
random skills like well I'm good at

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.130
communication organizing teamwork and I
take the initiative all the time

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:20.030
that's totally forgettable instead
choose two or three important strengths

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.850
that relate directly to the position
you're applying for

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.380
choose ones that will set you apart from
others and give some evidence so if

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.260
you're applying for a marketing manager
position you might say people tell me

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.080
that I'm a creative manager I can
motivate a team and make people feel

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.660
appreciated for example our team
recently tackled a tough project for a

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.800
really demanding client and did you
notice that I said people tell me that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.610
I'm a creative manager it's not just
your opinion you're telling them that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.940
other people think so too
now I wouldn't necessarily take the same

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.640
approach to the next type of question
you're bound to face and which you

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:24.550
probably dread answering the what are
your weaknesses question yes you're sure

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.510
to get this question in a job interview
so you'd better be ready for it three

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:38.440
bits of advice first don't choose
something that's actually a strength I'm

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.580
talking about the old well sometimes I'm
too much of a perfectionist they've

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.390
heard that before it doesn't fly anymore
secondly choose something that isn't

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:59.200
central to the position you're applying
for thirdly talk about how you've worked

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.040
to improve this weakness let's say
you're applying for a marketing manager

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.830
position and you're asked about a
weakness you might try something like

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.520
this in the past I've struggled with
public speaking giving presentations to

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.740
large groups of people at a conference
for example is a real challenge

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.710
that said I've joined Toastmasters and
I've been working hard to develop more

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.160
confidence with this other good
weaknesses to talk about being patient

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.040
when working on a team
delegating responsibilities giving

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:50.020
feedback or analyzing data if one of
those isn't central to the role it could

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:58.410
be a good one to mention all right how
about a quick recap of these tips first

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:06.750
practice a good response - tell me about
yourself that's professional passionate

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:14.470
positive and succinct second talk about
strengths that are related to the job

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:22.270
and set you apart from others and third
talk about a weakness that doesn't blow

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:29.200
up your chances of getting the position
and that you've worked to improve that's

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.230
