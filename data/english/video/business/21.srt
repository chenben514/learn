00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.460
You're learning with nine to five English business English for the workplace

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.749
Hi Tim here with another

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.690
nine-to-five English lesson

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.180
Today we're going to learn how to describe people and their characteristics in English

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.290
Listen in on any office conversation or a meeting and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.400
You'll hear a lot of talk about people who?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.809
we like

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.139
Who we don't like who's right for a team who should get a promotion?

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:54.919
Who is going on vacation? The list of topics goes on and on and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.559
One aspect of people we often discuss is their appearance or how they look

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.379
To do that we use adjectives like tall or short or

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.619
Well-dressed or heavy or thin?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.030
when we describe people, we also talk about the color of their hair and

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.889
Here's a couple of special hair words for you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.239
brunette means someone with brown hair and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.530
blond

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.720
refers to someone with light or yellow hair

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.469
Let's try describing people's appearance using some of this language

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.959
Listen to each example then repeat it for yourself ready. Let's get started

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.920
Gary is a tall red-haired guy who usually wears glasses

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.709
Bob looks a little bit like Dave our former manager

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.499
Jordan is really well-dressed and always smiling

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.019
Tina has long brown hair and green eyes

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.920
Now did you notice that expression

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.620
looks a little bit like

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.919
the basic expression there is

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.399
Looks like as in Nancy looks like Tina

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.809
in other words, they appear similar a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.299
couple more similar expressions for comparing people are

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.450
sounds like and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760
acts like

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.929
When we say someone acts like another person

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.779
we're talking about their behavior or what they do just

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.159
Like appearance. We often describe behavior

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.799
with adjectives

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.409
for example, we might say

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.940
someone is

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.940
eager or

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.840
Enthusiastic

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.000
we might also talk about how they do things like works hard or

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.730
treats people with respect

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.370
Let's try some examples of describing people's behavior

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.290
Remember to repeat the examples after you hear them

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.959
Charlie is always eager and ready to help

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.179
I tend to work harder when I'm under pressure

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.459
Kendra is the most enthusiastic person in the office

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.889
Joe treats everyone with a lot of respect

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.949
As you heard it's not only other people that we describe

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.429
Sometimes we describe ourselves

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.979
Especially in situations like job interviews and

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.429
Not only do we describe behavior

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.280
We also describe

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.570
character

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.999
Character is about what type of person someone is

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.579
It might include behavior, but it also includes

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.369
someone's overall personality

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.820
To talk about character we rely once again on

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.729
Adjectives and the more adjectives, you know, the better you can describe people's character

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.129
some people are serious while others are

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.180
fun-loving

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.180
Some people are hardworking

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.239
While others are lazy

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.419
some people are shy

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.629
While others are outgoing

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.999
Let's practice some of these adjectives for describing character once again

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.989
Repeat the examples after you hear them

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.929
Nancy seems pretty serious, but she's always fair

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.860
The right candidates should be hardworking and flexible

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.079
I would describe myself as a good learner and resourceful

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.269
Daisy can be quite shy but she's very smart

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.459
You probably know most of those adjectives

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.449
but

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.629
Resourceful might be a new word

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:03.509
If someone is resourceful, it means they are good at finding ways to solve problems

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.520
That's a great way to describe yourself in a job interview

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:12.779
Okay, so we've practiced

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.190
Describing people with some examples, but how does this sound in the conversation?

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.559
let's listen to a short dialogue between Kent and

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.550
Paula

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:35.550
They're talking about a person who has applied for a job at their company. Let's listen

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.250
Remind me again, which candidate was Jason

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.849
Jason was the tall guy with blond hair. Oh

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.440
Right, and how was his interview? Well, he seemed smart, but I wonder how flexible he is

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.180
That's not too difficult, right

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:05.550
when Kent asks Paula to describe Jason, she says that he's tall and

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.339
has blond hair and

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:15.059
When Kent asks how Jason's interview went she says he seems smart

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.820
but she wonders if he's

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.139
flexible

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:22.288
Now it's your turn to practice

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:30.598
Will repeat the dialogue but this time we're going to be about the second speakers words

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.200
You will have to say those parts yourself

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.159
Remember to describe Jason as

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:40.029
tall

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:42.059
with blond hair and

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.059
say he's smart, but

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.760
you wonder if he's

00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:50.339
flexible

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.470
Remind me again, which candidate was Jason

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.749
Oh, right, and how is his interview

00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:16.220
Alright

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.220
That's it for this lesson

00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:23.049
We've learned some great ways to describe people's appearance

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:25.959
behavior and character

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:29.319
We'll be back soon with some more

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.730
useful English

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.110
expressions

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.610
until then

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.440
so long and

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.440
Happy learning
