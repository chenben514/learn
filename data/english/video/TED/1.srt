00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:14.707
I know you all have long to-do lists,

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.503
but I hate wasting time so much
that I have a to-don't list.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.547
Don't scroll on social media,

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.257
don't check my phone in bed

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.800
and don't turn on the TV

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.678
unless I already know
what I want to watch.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.057
But last year I found myself
breaking all of those rules.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:33.059
I was staying up way past midnight,

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.351
doomscrolling,

00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:36.979
playing endless games of online Scrabble

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.776
and bingeing entire seasons of TV shows
that weren't even good.

00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:44.653
The next morning I'd wake up in a daze

00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:47.573
and swear, "Tonight in bed by 10:00."

00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:51.118
But it kept happening
night after night for weeks.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.411
What was I thinking?

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:54.830
As an organizational psychologist,

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:57.625
I have spent my whole career
studying motivation,

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:02.463
so it really bothers me
when I can't explain my own behavior.

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:07.593
I wasn't depressed. I still had hope.
Wasn't burned out, had energy.

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:10.429
Wasn't lonely, I was with my family.

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:15.017
I just felt a little bit aimless
and a little bit joyless.

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:18.020
Eventually, I remembered
there's a name for that feeling:

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.396
languishing.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:23.234
Languishing as a sense of emptiness,
stagnation and ennui.

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:25.778
It was coined by a sociologist Corey Keyes

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:28.989
and immortalized
by a philosopher, Mariah Carey.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.033
(Laughter)

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.745
When you're languishing, it just feels
like you're muddling through your days,

00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:37.164
looking at your life
through a foggy windshield.

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:41.168
So I'm curious how many of you have felt
like that over the past few months.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:46.507
OK, those of you who didn't have
the energy to raise your hands --

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.675
(Laughter)

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:50.469
you might be languishing right now.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.722
And you over here who didn't laugh,
you're definitely languishing.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.350
Strangely enough --

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.561
[How are you feeling today? 
Meh. Meh. Meh.]

00:01:58.602 --> 00:01:59.603
(Laughter)

00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:01.021
Some of you passed the quiz.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.319
Strangely enough, what rescued me
from that feeling was playing Mario Kart.

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:09.530
But let's back up for a second.

00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:11.740
In the early days of covid,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.911
a lot of us were struggling
with fear, grief and isolation.

00:02:15.953 --> 00:02:18.873
But as the pandemic dragged on
with no end in sight,

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:22.209
our acute anguish
gave way to chronic languish.

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:24.170
We were all living in “Groundhog Day.”

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.964
It felt like the whole world
was stagnating.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.509
So I wrote an article
to put languishing on the map.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.054
I called it "the neglected
middle child of mental health"

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:37.892
and I suggested it might be
the dominant emotion of our time.

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:39.852
And soon it was everywhere.

00:02:39.852 --> 00:02:41.604
I was seeing it all over the media,

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:44.356
being discussed
by celebrities, by royalty.

00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:46.650
I've never seen people so excited

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.278
to talk about their
utter lack of excitement.

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:52.198
(Laughter)

00:02:52.198 --> 00:02:53.449
And --

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:55.910
I think --

00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:57.870
I think that naming languishing

00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:01.207
helped people make sense
of some puzzling experiences.

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.042
Why even after getting vaccinated

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:06.462
people were having trouble
looking forward to the rest of the year.

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:09.173
Why when "National Treasure" came on TV,

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:12.468
my wife already knew
all the words by heart.

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.471
And why I was staying up way too late,

00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:19.475
falling victim to what's known
as revenge bedtime procrastination.

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:20.768
(Laughter)

00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:34.949
We were looking for bliss in a blah day
and purpose in a perpetual pandemic.

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:38.619
But languishing
is not unique to a pandemic.

00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:40.704
It's part of the human condition.

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:44.166
Two decades of research show
that languishing can disrupt your focus

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:46.252
and dampen your motivation.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.671
It's also a risk factor for depression

00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:51.840
because languishing
often lurks below the surface.

00:03:51.882 --> 00:03:54.426
You might not notice
when your drive is dwindling

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:56.595
or your delight is dulling

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:59.598
You’re indifferent
to your own indifference,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.433
which means you don't seek help

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:05.646
and you might not even do anything
to help yourself.

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:06.897
Meh.

00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:11.235
Languishing isn't
just hard to spot, though.

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:14.571
In many cultures,
it's hard to talk about, too.

00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.448
When people ask, "How are you?,"

00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:18.659
you're expected to say, "Great!"

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.036
or "Living my best life."

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:24.123
That's called toxic positivity.

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:26.292
(Laughter)

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.217
It's the pressure that we face to be
optimistic and upbeat at all times.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.803
If you say, "You know, I'm just OK,"

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:41.098
then people might encourage you
to look on the bright side

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.475
or count your blessings,

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:44.935
which isn't just annoying.

00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:47.021
It can actually be bad advice.

00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:48.772
Can I get two volunteers?

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.276
I will cold-call if I have to,
don't all jump at once.

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:53.902
OK, right over here.

00:04:53.902 --> 00:04:55.195
You can come up to a mic

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:58.991
and can I get another volunteer
right over there, up to this mic, please.

00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:01.035
A round of applause
for our two volunteers.

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:02.870
(Applause)

00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:06.373
Hi, what's your name?

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:07.458
Martin: Martin.

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:08.584
Adam Grant: Thank you.

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:11.628
Can you tell us three good things
about your life, please?

00:05:13.672 --> 00:05:18.177
Martin: I’m married 
and I’m healthy and I’m happy.

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:20.679
AG: All right, I’m glad
the marriage came in first.

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:22.848
Well done. OK, over here.
What’s your name?

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.891
Lee: Lee.

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.727
AG: Lee, can you tell us
42 good things about your life?

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.398
Lee: My cat Titchypoo, my dog Enzo.

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:32.775
And so my wife, Jazz.

00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:34.568
AG: Third behind the dog and the cat.

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:35.569
(Laughter)

00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:37.071
Well played.

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:39.156
Lee: My children, Indio and Walter,

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:40.866
Manchester United Football Club,

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:42.659
my friends, TED.

00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:45.496
AG: TED coming in at
ringing eighth.

00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:47.581
Lee: TED is very high, TED is very high.

00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:52.753
The poetry of C.S. Lewis,
E.E. Cummings, Dylan Thomas.

00:05:52.795 --> 00:05:55.506
AG: You want to name
all the poets you’ve ever heard of?

00:05:55.506 --> 00:05:57.341
Alright, Lee, thank you.

00:05:57.341 --> 00:05:58.842
We’re going to pause you there.

00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:00.886
Round of applause. Thank you both.

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:02.638
(Applause)

00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:08.435
So for a long time,
I assumed that people in Lee's position

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:11.105
were going to be happier than Martin.

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:14.483
But when I ran the experiment,
I found the exact opposite.

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:17.736
That people who are randomly assigned
to count more blessings,

00:06:17.736 --> 00:06:20.280
are actually, on average, less happy

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.242
because you start to run
out of things to be optimistic about.

00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:25.244
And if you don't know that many poets ...

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:26.995
(Laughter)

00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:30.249
The harder it is to find
good things about your life,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.087
the more you feel like,
well, maybe my life isn't that good.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.755
In the early days of the pandemic,

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:41.635
researchers found that the best predictor
of well-being was not optimism.

00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:42.928
It was flow.

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:46.640
Flow is that feeling of being in the zone,

00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:49.268
coined by the psychologist
Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:52.813
It's that state of total
absorption in an activity.

00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:57.484
For you, it might be cooking
or running or gardening

00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:58.986
where you lose track of time

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:02.364
and you might even lose
your sense of self.

00:07:02.364 --> 00:07:04.992
Flow is the appeal of a Netflix binge

00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:07.327
because you get transported
into a different world

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.163
and immersed in a story.

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:14.084
But bingeing is a temporary escape
from languishing, not a cure.

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:17.921
At best, it leaves you
with a bunch of asymmetric relationships.

00:07:17.963 --> 00:07:20.549
You might love hanging out
with your friends:

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:22.342
Chandler,

00:07:22.384 --> 00:07:23.635
Arya,

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:24.970
Dwight,

00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:26.388
Buffy -- Buffy, anyone? --

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.473
(Laughter)

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:28.765
Joe Exotic,

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:30.976
Peppa Pig.

00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:33.896
(Whispers) But they don't know you exist.

00:07:35.814 --> 00:07:39.693
Bingeing is passive engagement
in a fictional world,

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:42.571
peak flow depends on active participation

00:07:42.571 --> 00:07:44.323
in the real world,

00:07:44.323 --> 00:07:47.659
which is why I was so surprised
to find my flow

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:51.079
while driving a cartoon car
in a Nintendo game.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.583
When the pandemic first started,

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:57.711
all three of our kids
were at home in online school,

00:07:57.753 --> 00:07:59.922
and that lasted for a full year.

00:07:59.963 --> 00:08:01.882
It was not easy.

00:08:01.924 --> 00:08:04.593
One day we found this
on our six-year-old's report card.

00:08:04.676 --> 00:08:09.515
[can independently mute and unmute 
himself when requested to do so]

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:11.183
(Laughter)

00:08:12.017 --> 00:08:15.979
You know, I know some adults who still
haven't figured that out yet,

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:18.815
not just online, but in real life, too.

00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:21.527
So I guess we had that to celebrate.

00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:25.781
But like many of you,
we were isolated from extended family.

00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:28.367
My sister was halfway across the country.

00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:31.995
And one day we were reminiscing
about how much we love playing Mario Kart

00:08:32.037 --> 00:08:33.330
as we were kids.

00:08:33.372 --> 00:08:36.458
And she said, "Well,
we could all play together online now."

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.752
Why don't we start a family game?

00:08:38.794 --> 00:08:40.587
And soon we were playing every day

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:42.756
with a video call
running at the same time.

00:08:43.632 --> 00:08:47.469
And after a couple of weeks
I stopped feeling so blah.

00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:50.222
I was living zen in the art of Mario Kart.

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:51.515
(Laughter)

00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:55.852
In the morning our kids were waking up,
asking what time we would play.

00:08:55.852 --> 00:08:57.479
They were excited.

00:08:57.479 --> 00:09:00.774
And they loved it when I would gloat
about an impending victory,

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:03.527
only to be bombed by a flying blue shell

00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:06.154
and then just sit there
watching all three of our kids

00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:09.074
drive past me to the finish line
in tiny go-carts.

00:09:10.075 --> 00:09:13.412
We had so much fun that we started
a new Saturday night tradition

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:15.080
after the kids were asleep.

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:16.415
Adult Mario Kart.

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:17.666
(Laughter)

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:21.962
So after reflecting on that experience,

00:09:22.004 --> 00:09:25.090
I'm proud to present to you
for the first time

00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:27.926
my Mario Kart theory of peak flow.

00:09:29.094 --> 00:09:33.974
It has three conditions:
mastery, mindfulness and mattering.

00:09:34.016 --> 00:09:35.726
Let's start with mastery.

00:09:35.726 --> 00:09:37.019
Mastery is something

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:39.730
a lot of us have been having
a hard time finding lately.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.897
(Laughter)

00:09:40.897 --> 00:09:43.191
Psychologists find that at work

00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:46.278
the strongest factor
in daily motivation and joy

00:09:46.278 --> 00:09:48.030
is a sense of progress.

00:09:48.947 --> 00:09:52.492
We find that our happiness
depends in Western cultures

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:56.747
more on how our projects are going today
than how they went yesterday.

00:09:56.788 --> 00:09:58.874
That's why Nike says, "Just do it."

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.212
I guess if Nike had been started
in a more past-focused country like China,

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:06.506
their slogan would be, "Just did it."

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:13.722
If languishing is stagnation,
flow involves momentum.

00:10:13.764 --> 00:10:17.017
But mastery does not have to be
a big accomplishment,

00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:19.102
it can be small wins.

00:10:19.102 --> 00:10:22.356
Small wins explain
why I was drawn to online Scrabble

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:25.525
for the rush of playing
a seven-letter word.

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:28.362
Small wins makes sense
of why so many people were thrilled

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:30.947
to bake their first loaf
of sourdough bread.

00:10:30.947 --> 00:10:35.577
And small wins explain
why one engineer spent an entire afternoon

00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:40.374
mastering the art of stacking M&amp;M's
on top of each other.

00:10:40.415 --> 00:10:41.667
Take a look.

00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:44.711
(Video) This is going to be
harder than I thought.

00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:52.761
Oh!

00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:54.721
Oh!

00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:56.598
Five M&amp;Ms! Five M&amp;Ms!

00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:59.351
(Laughter)

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.562
AG: Turns out that was a world record.

00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:04.147
(Laughter)

00:11:04.147 --> 00:11:07.818
That kind of mastery depends
on a second condition for flow,

00:11:07.818 --> 00:11:09.111
mindfulness.

00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:12.447
Focusing your full attention
on a single task,

00:11:12.447 --> 00:11:16.201
not something a lot of us
are doing that much these days.

00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:19.913
[Are you OK? You’re barely paying 
attention to your book, phone, show ... ]

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:22.791
[ ... laptop and the crossword 
you started ten minutes ago.]

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:27.879
There's evidence that on average,
people are checking emails 74 times a day,

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:32.008
switching tasks every 10 minutes,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.011
and that creates
what's been called time confetti,

00:11:35.053 --> 00:11:37.848
where we take what could be
meaningful moments of our lives

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:39.141
and we shred them

00:11:39.182 --> 00:11:41.560
into increasingly tiny, useless pieces.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:46.982
Time confetti is an enemy
of both energy and of excellence.

00:11:46.982 --> 00:11:49.985
If we want to find flow,
we need better boundaries.

00:11:50.068 --> 00:11:54.448
[It keeps me from looking at my phone
every two seconds.]

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:55.907
(Laughter)

00:11:57.492 --> 00:11:58.952
When I think about boundaries,

00:11:58.994 --> 00:12:02.706
I think of an experiment
by organizational scholar Leslie Perlow.

00:12:02.748 --> 00:12:07.127
She went to a Fortune 500 company
and she tested a quiet time policy.

00:12:07.169 --> 00:12:10.505
No interruptions
three mornings a week before noon.

00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:14.384
On average, engineers
spiked in productivity.

00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:17.596
47 percent of them
were more productive than usual.

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:21.933
But the best part is that when the company
made quiet time official policy,

00:12:21.933 --> 00:12:24.811
they had 65 percent
above average productivity.

00:12:25.729 --> 00:12:27.606
I don't think there's anything magical

00:12:27.606 --> 00:12:30.192
about Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday before noon.

00:12:30.192 --> 00:12:33.612
The lesson here is that we need to treat
uninterrupted blocks of time

00:12:33.612 --> 00:12:35.280
as treasures to guard.

00:12:36.698 --> 00:12:39.993
Now, mastery and mindfulness
will get you to flow,

00:12:40.035 --> 00:12:43.413
but there's a third condition
that turns it into a peak experience.

00:12:43.455 --> 00:12:47.375
Mattering. Knowing that you
make a difference to other people.

00:12:48.293 --> 00:12:50.879
Early in my career,
I was studying fundraising callers

00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:54.090
who were trying to bring in
alumni donations to a university,

00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:58.303
and I knew they were languishing
when I saw this sign posted on their wall.

00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:02.349
[Doing a good job here is like
wetting your pants in a dark suit]

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.684
[You get a warm feeling
but no one else notices]

00:13:04.726 --> 00:13:06.311
(Laughter)

00:13:06.478 --> 00:13:09.731
I wanted to study how to show them
that their work mattered.

00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:12.108
So I designed a series of experiments

00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:15.153
and over the next month,
one group of callers on average

00:13:15.153 --> 00:13:17.614
more than doubled
in weekly time on the phone

00:13:17.614 --> 00:13:20.826
and nearly tripled in weekly revenue.

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:24.788
What moved the needle was randomly
assigning them to meet one student

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.207
whose scholarship
had been funded by their work.

00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:31.628
Now, instead of focusing
on the monotonous process of making calls,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.924
they were absorbed in a meaningful purpose
of helping to fund tuition.

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:40.929
So think about the people who would be
worse off if your job didn't exist.

00:13:40.971 --> 00:13:43.557
Those are the people
who make your work matter.

00:13:43.598 --> 00:13:47.060
You need to know their names,
their faces and their stories,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.813
and you can find flow
in projects that benefit them.

00:13:51.106 --> 00:13:54.818
This all explains why Mario Kart
was such a great experience for me.

00:13:54.818 --> 00:13:56.736
It gave me a feeling of mastery,

00:13:56.736 --> 00:14:00.532
the sweet satisfaction
of a perfectly placed banana peel

00:14:00.532 --> 00:14:02.576
for my sister to slip on.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.620
It required mindfulness too.

00:14:05.662 --> 00:14:07.539
My brother-in-law was the best player.

00:14:07.581 --> 00:14:09.791
Beating him demanded total concentration,

00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:12.711
especially when my kids
were ganging up with him against me.

00:14:13.837 --> 00:14:16.590
And it wasn't just a game. It mattered.

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:21.720
Over the past year, we've all felt
helpless in one way or another.

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.638
I felt helpless to fix covid.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.516
I couldn't even do that much
to make online school better.

00:14:26.558 --> 00:14:27.767
And I'm a teacher.

00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:31.855
But in Mario Kart, I felt helpful.

00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:34.524
I was able to give my kids
something to look forward to

00:14:34.524 --> 00:14:36.026
when we couldn't go anywhere.

00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:39.237
I was able to keep my family close
when we were far apart.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.116
We normally think of flow
as an individual experience.

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:46.411
But playing Nintendo,
we were all immersed together.

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.496
And although we don't play daily anymore,

00:14:48.538 --> 00:14:50.999
I feel closer to my sister
and my brother-in-law

00:14:51.041 --> 00:14:53.043
than I ever had before.

00:14:53.084 --> 00:14:56.755
I learned that love is not
the frequency of communication,

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.298
it's the depth of connections.

00:14:59.674 --> 00:15:02.552
I also realized
that the antidote to languishing

00:15:02.594 --> 00:15:05.013
does not have to be something productive,

00:15:05.055 --> 00:15:06.932
it can be something joyful.

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:12.604
Our peak moments of flow
are having fun with the people we love,

00:15:12.604 --> 00:15:16.024
which is now a daily task
on my to-do list.

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:18.985
So what's your version of Mario Kart?

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:22.697
Where do you find mastery and mindfulness
with the people who matter to you?

00:15:23.782 --> 00:15:25.951
I think we need to rethink
our understanding

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:27.827
of mental health and well-being.

00:15:27.869 --> 00:15:32.040
Not depressed doesn't mean
you're not struggling.

00:15:32.082 --> 00:15:33.667
Not burned out

00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:35.877
doesn't mean you're fired up.

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:38.254
When someone says, "How are you?,"

00:15:38.296 --> 00:15:41.883
it's OK to say,
"Honestly, I'm languishing."

00:15:42.884 --> 00:15:45.720
Or if you can only muster one syllable,

00:15:45.762 --> 00:15:47.013
"Meh."

00:15:47.055 --> 00:15:48.306
(Laughter)

00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:51.309
And when you're ready,
you can start finding the flow

00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:53.812
that lights a path out of the void.

00:15:53.812 --> 00:15:54.854
Thank you.

00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:58.191
(Applause)
