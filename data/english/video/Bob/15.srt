Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.930
Sometimes when you’re having an English
conversation you want to be able to talk about

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.140
the weather, and you probably already know
some of the basics.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.370
You probably know how to say, “It’s sunny.”

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.300
You probably know how to say, “It’s raining.”

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.950
But in this video I’ll help you learn some
more advanced phrases to talk about the weather

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.370
in English.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.289
Hey welcome to this video.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.470
If this is your first time here don’t forget
to click the subscribe button below and the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.030
bell icon, and if you don’t mind sometime
during this video, if you like it, give me

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.170
a thumbs up!

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.739
So we’re here to talk about the weather.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.380
There’s a lot different kinds of weather.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.650
There’s a lot of different kinds of temperatures,
and in English it’s nice to be able to talk

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.070
about all of them.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.510
Let’s start by talking about temperature.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.200
If you’re talking about temperature in general,
you can say things like, from hot to cold:

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360
It is hot out!

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.399
It is warm out - a little less hot.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920
It is cool out.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.260
It is cold out.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.010
Or: It is freezing.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.590
Notice I went from really warm to really cool.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.890
So those are general ways to talk about the
temperature outside.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.900
You can of course also say the exact temperature.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.130
Today, at my place, it is six degrees celsius
outside.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.380
You’ll wanna be able to say celsius or fahrenheit
depending on which segment of measurement

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.670
the country you are in uses.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.680
Most places around the world, I think use
celsius.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.851
So today there might be a high of nine degrees
later today.

00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:46.430
If it stays sunny it will get warmer.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.490
But let’s also talk about a few different
kinds of weather descriptions.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.340
In my introduction I mentioned you probably
already know how to say, “It is sunny.”

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.119
You can also say: “The sun is out.”

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.979
You can also say, “The sun is bright today.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.100
The sun is very bright today.”

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.519
And I’d like to give you examples of how
to use the past, the present, and the future.

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.329
So you could say:

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.389
Yesterday it was sunny.

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.290
Today it is sunny.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.040
Tomorrow it is going to be sunny.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.180
or
Tomorrow it will be sunny.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.409
It is sunny out today.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.300
At my place, I don’t think you can actually
see it, but it’s quite sunny out today.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.480
A bit of the opposite of sunny is a rainy
day.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.510
You can describe rain in a couple of ways.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.930
You can say, “It is raining.”

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.840
or you can say, “It is a rainy day.”

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.219
Both are totally valid ways to talk about
rain.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.189
But there’s different degrees of rain.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.059
We could say, “It is spitting outside.”

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:56.510
which means very small drops, very small raindrops
are coming down.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.510
I could say, “It’s drizzling.” which
is a little more rain than spitting.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.939
I could say simply, “It is raining.” which
is a pretty steady rain.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.859
Or, I could say, “It is pouring outside.”

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.489
Pouring is when the rain just comes down in
torrents.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.469
It’s just an amazing amount of water falling
out of the sky as raindrops.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.279
But let’s look at the past, the present,
and the future.

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:23.279
You could say:

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:26.169
Yesterday it was raining.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.469
Today it is raining.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.999
Tomorrow it is going to rain.

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.219
or
Tomorrow it will rain.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.219
Rain.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.219
Water falling out of the sky.

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:40.059
I actually love being outside in a nice rainstorm.

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.829
As long as it’s warm outside.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.379
I don’t like being outside in the rain when
it’s cold.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.819
Sometimes you have a day where there’s no
rain, but there’s lots of clouds.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.339
So let’s talk about cloudy days.

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.650
You can say, “It is cloudy.”

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.729
In English we also say, “It is overcast.”

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.799
Overcast meaning that the clouds have covered
up the sun.

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.260
It is a cloudy day.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.969
It is an overcast day.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.510
Sometimes in the weather announcement they’ll
say, “It’s going to be partly cloudy.”

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.869
That means there will be some clouds in the
sky, but they won’t be completely covering

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:19.150
the sky, so you’ll still see some blue sky
with clouds in the sky.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.520
We also sometimes just say, “There’s lots
of clouds.”

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.199
“There’s lots of clouds out today.”

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.400
Just indicating that it is a cloudy day by
stating that there’s clouds in the sky.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.080
Yesterday it was cloudy.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.069
Today it is cloudy.

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.301
Tomorrow it is going to be cloudy.
or

00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:38.479
Tomorrow it will be cloudy.

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.560
In Canada we have another kind of weather
which some of you may have and that’s snow.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.069
You can describe it as,”It is snowing.”

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.229
“It is a snowy day.”

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.129
And there’s a variety of different kinds
of words and phrases that go along with snow.

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.340
We have drifting snow, when the wind blows
the snow along the ground and starts to pile

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.039
it in different places.

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.130
We have snow that comes down with really big
snowflakes.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.300
We have what we call,”packing snow” which
is snow that comes down when the temperature

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.229
is close to zero, and you’re able to pack
the snow together and build things like snowmen.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.889
Snow’s a fun thing, I know some of you live
in countries where you never get to say, “It

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.009
is snowing outside.”

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.870
or “It is snowy.”

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.289
but let’s talk about how to say it in the
past, the present, and the future anyways.

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.289
You can say:

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.639
Yesterday it was snowing.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.491
Today it is snowing.
and

00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:33.660
Tomorrow it is going to snow.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.530
or
Tomorrow it will snow.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.520
So you notice the background changed, it was
windy.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.800
So let’s talk about wind.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.199
Wind is obviously when the air blows and starts
to move stuff and you can say, “It is windy.”

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.479
or you can say, “It is a windy day.”

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.479
You can say:
Yesterday it was windy.

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.491
Today it is windy.
and

00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:57.030
Tomorrow it is going to be windy.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.849
And we describe wind a couple of ways.

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.749
A really slow calm wind is called a breeze.

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:07.389
And we also describe wind when it’s really
really fast moving as it is a hard wind.

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.249
And we also describe wind by how fast it goes.

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.030
So they might say, “Tomorrow we are going
to have 80 kilometer per hour winds.”

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.379
Those are really really hard fast winds.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.719
So,
Yesterday it was windy.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:22.889
Today it is windy.

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.000
Tomorrow it is going to be windy.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.550
Tomorrow it will be windy.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.550
The wind.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.020
I know there is a lot of different kinds of
weather, but this is the last time I’m going

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.090
to talk about and that is fog.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.190
So fog is when there’s so much moisture
in the air that you can hardly see more than

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.039
a few meters in front of you.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.629
And we describe it as saying, “It is foggy.”

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.360
We also say things like, “The fog rolled
in.”

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.719
Sometimes the fog rolls into an area.

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.240
So there’s no fog, and then the fog comes
to the area slowly, and we say the fog is

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.340
rolling in.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.710
When fog is really really thick we describe
it as, “It’s as thick as pea soup.”

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.509
And I don’t know if you’ve ever seen pea
soup, but it’s a really really thick kind

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:05.759
of soup that you eat.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.430
And when the fog is really thick we say the
fog is like pea soup.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.150
And we also say, “Visibility is low.”

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.229
And, and usually we’re saying that because
people are going to be driving and on the

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:21.039
weather report they’ll say, “Fog has rolled
in, visibility is going to be low.”

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.749
Which means you’re not going to be able
to see very well.

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:24.779
In the past we say:

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.849
Yesterday it was foggy.

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:28.350
Today it is foggy.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.409
And in the future we would say:
Tomorrow it is going to be foggy.

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.310
Or
Tomorrow it will be foggy.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.610
Well that’s a look at some English words
and phrases to talk about the weather.
