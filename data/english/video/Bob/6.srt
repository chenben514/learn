Hi, Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.930
Let’s learn English on the road!

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.139
I have to make sure I don’t get run over!

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.339
Haha!

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.580
Hey Bob the Canadian here welcome to this
video about roads, streets, and highways.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.840
down into the description to look for free
bonus material to help you practice the English

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.830
that we’re going over in this video.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.300
Well, hey, welcome to this video we’re going
to talk a little bit about roads, streets,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.190
and highways today, and some of the things
that you will find beside them.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.440
This road here is a paved road, that means
the surface of the road is hard and that means

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.010
that cars can go a lot faster and it’s just
easier to drive on.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.640
And this part right here is called the shoulder
of the road, so when you pull off the road

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.490
you can go onto the shoulder of the road.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.659
This part over here is kind of a little hard
to see is called the ditch, and the ditch

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.980
is where when it rains all the water would
run off the road into the ditch to keep the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.470
road nice and dry.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.570
The road behind me is what we would call a
gravel road or a dirt road.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.780
A paved road like we saw has a hard surface.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.060
A gravel road has all of these little stones,
I’ll hold them up to the camera.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.619
So there’s a couple ways that you’ll know
that you need to stop when you get to the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.049
end of a street or road.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.909
Behind me you’ll see a stop sign.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.659
This is a red sign with the word stop in it,
and it has eight sides, it’s an octagon.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.369
So a stop sign is one of the ways that you
know that you need to stop your car.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.180
So the intersection behind me here is called
a four way stop, or an all way stop.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.230
If you can see under the stop sign here it
says, “All Way”.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.120
What that means is that whoever stops first
at the intersection gets to go next.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.879
So everyone needs to take turns going through
this intersection.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.650
So another way you’ll know when to stop
is when you see a stoplight or a traffic signal.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.859
So behind me is an intersection where two
roads cross and up here you can see that the

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.719
light just turned red.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.709
Red lights mean stop, and green lights mean
go.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.969
You can also see right here these white lines
are what’s called a crosswalk.

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.620
This is where if you push the button on the
pole over there, there’s a pole, and you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.129
wait then eventually it tells you, this little
hand here will turn to a person and you can

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.129
walk.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.430
..we have a little sign here, how’s it going!

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.799
So I’m at a railway crossing right and if
you notice right here there’s a railway

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.169
crossing light.

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.950
When that light comes on it means there’s
a train coming.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.790
I think I’m just in time to see this.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.099
Let’s watch the train go by.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:49.439
Here it comes!

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:55.620
So that’s why when that light’s going
you should not cross the railroad track.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.989
So we looked at stop signs, which tell you
that you need to stop.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.339
But sometimes you wanna know how fast you
can go.

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:10.040
On the sides of the road you will see speed
limit signs which tell you how fast you can

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.040
drive your vehicle.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.850
This is speed limit sign from a city or town
and it says you can do 50 kilometres an hour

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.000
maximum.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.170
This is a speed limit sign from out in the
country.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.290
It says you can 80 kilometres an hour max,
and if you go any faster you might get a ticket.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.970
So I’m gonna let you guess what this sign
means and you can post it in the comments

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.970
below.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.590
I’m not gonna give you any hints but if
you think you know post it below.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.730
So sometimes along the side of the road they
want to protect things so they put up what

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.110
is called a guardrail.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.930
A guardrail stops vehicles from going off
the road if they lose control.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.100
So let’s say the road was really icy and
slippery and if you lost control you would

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.110
hit the guardrail first instead of that pole
that they’re trying to protect.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.230
So this is a guardrail.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.340
So I’m going to walk through the ditch here,
if you remember the ditch is the part on the

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.420
side of the road that the water can go into,
but we’re going to kind of jump across the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.300
ditch here because I want to show you this
pole.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:32.640
So in Canada we call these hydro poles, let
me lean back for you and you can see the hydro

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.640
wires.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.180
In the United States they’re called utility
poles or telephone poles and the lines at

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.260
the top are usually called power lines.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.830
Hopefully I don't get my shoe wet when I go
through the ditch this time.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.810
Let’s see how it goes.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.400
I think I’m gonna make it.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.240
So behind me here you’ll see a street, a
city street, and what makes a street a little

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.850
bit different than a road is that you will
usually find a sidewalk.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.510
This is a place for pedestrians to walk.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.740
Pedestrians are people who are walking along
the sidewalk.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.390
Sometimes you’ll even find a bike lane.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:21.520
If you look down here you’ll see the shape
of a bike because on this road there’s a

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.270
special lane just for people who are biking.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.870
And one of the main differences is that in
the city you’re going to always find….

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.940
I always have trouble pointing.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.090
You’re always gonna find street lights.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.190
So right here we have a nice street light
and there’s a few of them all along this

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.190
road.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.190
There’s another one right here.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.200
So this street, is well lit at night.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.390
You noticed I just called it a road.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:52.410
I think that’s because I live in the country
and it’s easier to refer to this that way.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.880
But this is a street, it’s definitely a
street.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.460
It is a city street.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.680
Sidewalk.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.250
Bike lane.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.150
Street lights.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.400
So behind me you can see the highway.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.990
This is a six lane highway.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.170
It has three lanes going in either direction.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:18.139
If you look over here it’s a little hard
to see but you can see the off ramp.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:24.170
The off ramp is what allows traffic to get
off the highway, and if you look over here

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.910
you can just sort of see the on ramp.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.750
The on ramp is where you can speed up to get
on the highway.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.930
I’m standing on what we would call an overpass.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:43.340
An overpass is the road or street that goes
overtop of a highway, and below me the cars

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.200
are going under through the underpass.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.010
It’s a lot of traffic.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:55.180
Well hey, thanks for watching this video about
roads, streets, highways, and the things that

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.550
you sometimes find along them.
