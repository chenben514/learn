Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.030
Let’s learn English downtown!

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.349
Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.219

thumbs up at some point during this video

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.730
if it’s helping you learn English.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.430
Hey Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.189
I thought that we would take some time today
to learn some English downtown.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.359
Downtown is how we describe the parts of a
town or city where it originally started.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.249
So this is the downtown area of my local town.

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:50.300
And it has a lot of things for us to look
at and along the way I’ll teach you a little

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.300
bit of English.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.519
So this is downtown Dunnville!

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.020
So in a downtown area you’ll find sidewalks,
you’ll see a sidewalk over here.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.640
Where the sidewalk meets the road is what
we call the curb.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.010
So this right here is the curb.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.280
It’s a little hard to see because of all
the snow.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.550
And then usually on each side of the street
you’ll see what we call parking spaces or

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.350
a parking spot.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.300
In some towns there will be a small meter,
a parking meter where you can put money in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.640
in order to pay for the parking spot, but
in this town, yeah you can see the lines right

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.200
here, you’re allowed to park on each side
of the street for free.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780
So that’s kind of cool!

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.010
The parking areas that you find in a downtown
area sometimes have a sign that tells you

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.290
what the parking rules are.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.160
So this parking spot says you can park from
8AM to 2AM but only for 2 hours.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.340
And above that it says it’s a snow route
from November 15th to April 15th and you’re

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.680
not allowed to park there from 2AM to 8AM.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.030
That’s to let the snow plows come through
and clear out the snow.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.500
Another thing you’ll see in a downtown area
are storefronts.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.280
So you can see along the other side of the
road there that there’s a number of stores

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.380
and if I turn around you can see behind me
there’s also a row of storefronts.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.410
So storefronts usually have of course the
entrance, let me see if I can find an entrance

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.880
here, this green door is an entrance, but
they also have their front display window.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.110
You’ll find all sorts of different stores
in a downtown area.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.150
In this downtown there’s a music store,
there’s a sweets shop where you can buy

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.670
candies, there’s a couple of restaurants.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.420
Across the street there’s a jewelry store,
there’s a bank, and there’s also an electronics

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.569
store.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.150
So generally in a downtown area you can find
almost any kind of store you want.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.510
When I look across the street I see a shoe
store, I see a drug store, and two more banks.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.150
I guess banks are important because you can
get money to go buy something.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.459
Another nice thing about downtown is you usually
have streetlights.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.440
You can see along this street here there are
a few streetlights and there’s one above

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.500
me as well.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.730
I’ll give you a closer look at it.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.120
You can see that these streetlights are still
decorated for Christmas.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.280
But the nice thing about a downtown is it
has streetlights, it has the storefronts,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.330
and at night you can come down and do a little
bit of shopping because there’s lots of

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.330
light.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.280
If you listen you can hear a bird singing.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.470
I hope that means Spring is coming!

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.959
Another thing you’ll have downtown are places
to park your bikes or a bike rack.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.020
So you can see here even though it’s winter
in Canada, someone still rode their bike to

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.610
the downtown area today and they have a bike
lock on it, you can see the bike lock here

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.360
attaching it to the bike rack.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.349
So a lot of times in a downtown you’ll find
a bike rack where you can park your bike and

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.349
lock it up.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.030
Another thing you’ll see in a downtown area
are a lot of fire hydrants.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.049
So fire hydrants are a place where firefighters
can come with their fire truck if there’s

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.320
a fire and it’s a source of water where
they can hook up their hoses in order to fight

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320
the fire.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.970
So you’ll see a lot of fire hydrants in
a downtown area as well.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.100
So because a downtown area is a place where
the town wants people to come and enjoy themselves

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.260
you usually have some park benches.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.870
So even though we’re not in a park you can
see that there are some park benches here.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.230
As well there will often be lots of garbage
cans.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.960
It’s nice to keep the downtown clean so
you’ll almost always see garbage cans and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.020
benches along the way just to create a nicer
area for people to spend time in.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.970
So you’ll often find a mailbox in a downtown
area where you can still mail letters.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.410
The letters go in the top here.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.900
You can open it up, put your letters in.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.410
By the way if you haven’t sent me a postcard
yet you still can.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.750
My address is down in the description.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.740
In Canada where it freezes in the winter you’ll
see a lot of this.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.120
This is a bucket of salt or a container of
salt.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.150
And we have that there because we put salt
down when it’s really cold and frozen and

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.980
there’s ice on the sidewalks and the salt
will actually melt the ice.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.930
So quite often in downtown area you’ll have
businesses but above the businesses you’ll

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.370
have small apartments.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.120
So you have stores or businesses on the bottom
level, but in these buildings the next two

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.800
levels are actually small apartments where
people live.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.949
So you could rent an apartment and live in
the downtown area above a small business.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.350
There’s a pigeon that lives in this town.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.820
I’m not, I’m not sure what, I’m not
sure what he’s doing but he was up on this

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.150
roof and he just flew down here so.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.320
In a lot of bigger cities you’ll see a lot
of pigeons.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.310
I think ‘cause people feed them.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.830
That would be my guess.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:33.930
So the place between two buildings is called
an alley, or an alleyway, or a back alley.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.040
So you can see there’s a building on this
side and there’s a building on this side

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.240
and this area here between the buildings is
called an alley, or alleyway, or back alley.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.910
Here’s what this town looked like a long
time ago.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.770
It’s kind of cool because you can see the
old cars, but a lot of the buildings are still

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.520
the same as the buildings that, that we were
just looking at.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.720
So it’s pretty cool.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.890
A nice old picture of the downtown.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:10.330
Well hey that was a look at the downtown area
of one of my local towns.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.840
