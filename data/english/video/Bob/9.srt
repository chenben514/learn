Hi, Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:08.120
Let’s learn English at the park!

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.820
Hey, Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.820

Hi, Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.939
I thought today would be a great day to come
to the park.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.949
And I’m at a park that has everything that
I would want to have at a park to be able

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.310
to do a video where I can help you learn English.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:42.580
So let’s walk around and I will show you
a whole bunch of things that, that a park,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.840
that a city park would have.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.300
Often at a park you will find a playground.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.440
A place for kids to come and play.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.320
There will usually be a playground area like
this, and usually there will be swings.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.440
I should go try one of these swings right
now, what do you think, let me just aim the

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.510
camera a little closer and let me run over
and, and let me see how this goes.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.609
I think I’m getting too old for that.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.930
Let’s, let’s move on to the next part
of the park.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.270
One thing that I really like at a park is
if people keep it clean.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:30.909
It’s really nice if people pick up their
garbage and put it into a proper garbage can.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.430
This particular park has a really nice path
where if you wanted to go for a walk, or if

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.710
you wanted to go for bike ride, or if you
just wanted to go for a run.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.090
It’s nice when a park has paths.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.170
This particular park also, I’m not sure
if you can see them in the distance let’s

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.600
turn for a sec, actually has light poles way
over there.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.890
You can even come here at night if you needed
to go for a run and you could do it safely.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.319
Often times at a park you’ll also find outdoor
covered areas.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.079
This particular covered area we would call
a gazebo in English.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.470
It’s just really nice if it’s a really
hot sunny day or if it’s a rainy day you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.950
can still come to the park and sit in the
gazebo.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.170
You can bring a book, there’s some benches
where you can sit.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.670
This is what we would call a pavilion.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.480
Sometimes in the summer you can rent a pavilion
at the local park, and you can have a family

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.970
reunion in the pavilion.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.750
A family reunion is when you just get together
with all of your family, and all of your extended

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.990
family, just to see how everyone’s doing
and what they’ve been up to.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.500
Sometimes at the park the landscaping is even
more extensive.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.750
We’re going to walk to the top of this in
a minute.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.921
I think this is here and it’s up on a hill
so that you can watch ships go by.

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.220
I don’t think there’s a ship going by
today in the canal.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.000
I was really hoping there would be, but we’ll
walk to the top and we’ll see what we can

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
see.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.150
So I’m not sure how well you can see this,
but behind me is the actual Welland Canal.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.910
When I was a kid every once in a while we
would come to the canal and we would wave

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.450
at all the sailors on the boats.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.770
And it would be people from all different
countries.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.170
People from some of your countries that would
be on huge ships.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.840
They would come through the Welland, they
would come through the Welland Canal on their

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.430
way out to Lake Ontario, and the eventually
making their way down the St. Lawrence River

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.470
to the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.310
But today, there’s no boats.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.310
Sorry.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.280
I was really hoping there would be a boat.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.650
One of my favourite things at the park is
really big trees.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.930
I just love trees that have lots of shade.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.120
Normally if I do go to the park in the summer
I end up sitting under a tree like this one.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.069
I’m not a big fan of really warm days and
lots of sunshine.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.380
There’s , so, parks are cool because there’s
big trees and there’s usually lots of grass

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.770
and just lots of green, so you feel really
close to nature.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.090
If you’re lucky, the park you’re at will
have what we call a skate park.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.180
A skate park is a place where you can bring
your skateboard, your roller blades.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.790
This is for much younger people.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.570
I, Bob the Canadian does not come to the skate
park, but you can come to the skate park,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.010
usually there’s a bunch of people here.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.960
Today it’s kind of empty, but anyways, one
of the things you might find at a park is

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.870
a skate park.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.120
Somebody forgot their helmet at the park.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.930
I think I’ll just leave it here and while
I’m making the video maybe they’ll come

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.930
and pick it up.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:56.780
It’s really nice if a park has restrooms,
or bathrooms, or in Canada we call them washrooms.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.220
But sometimes you just need to go to the bathroom,
you need to use the restroom and it’s nice

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.830
if a park actually has that.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.580
Some smaller parks don’t, but usually a
larger park like this park will have a restroom

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.940
where maybe you’re here with your family
and your little kids, it’s nice to come

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.350
to a park where you can just take them to
the bathroom.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.520
Well, hey, that was super fun to be able to
show you what a park looks like in Canada.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.150
I’m sure in your cities you have parks.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.060
They probably have even more flowers, if you’re
in a warmer place.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.500
But it was super fun to be able to show you
the park and all of the different areas here.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.040
I’m Bob the Canadian.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.460
