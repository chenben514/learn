Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.959
Sometimes you wanna just go outside to have
some fun.

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:11.090
In this video I’ll help you learn all of
the English words and phrases that you’ll

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:20.290
need to know to describe going outside to
have fun.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.470

for everyone watching if at some point during
the video you could give me a thumbs up that

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.369
would be awesome.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.520
Thanks a lot.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.649
So, you wanna go outside to have some fun.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.870
One of the first things you might do outside
for fun involves two legs and two feet.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.570
You might go for a walk.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.319
You might go for a run, or you might go for
a hike.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:53.139
If you go for a walk you will most likely
be walking on the sidewalk.

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.589
Which is kind of a concrete path along the
side of the road.

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.639
If you go for a walk you might be going to
the park.

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.409
Or you might just be going for a walk around
your own yard.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.320
But either way, getting outside for a walk
just involves an enjoyable day appreciating

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.030
the sun and being outside for a time.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.450
You might also be going out for a run.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.670
And if you go for a run, you will most likely
be running in one of three places.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.329
You might go for a run or a jog, jogging is
the same thing as running.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.620
You might for a run along the side of the
road.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.590
You might go for a run on a sidewalk.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.200
Or you might have a school or other place
near you that has a track.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.039
And you might be going for a run on a track.

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.960
I don’t usually go for runs.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.180
I’m more of a walking kind of person.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.340
You might also in the two foot, two leg getting
outdoors category, you might go for a hike.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.840
A hike usually involves going to someplace
where there is a hiking trail.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.510
Maybe when you go hiking you have special
hiking boots.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.010
And maybe you have some walking sticks that
you take with you.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.540
But generally hiking is done somewhere where
there’s lots of trees, where you’re out

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.530
in nature, where you’re outdoors.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.530
And you just enjoy some time walking, hiking,
through the woods.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.970
I in particular love hiking cause, because
usually there’s shade.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.110
A second thing you might do if you wanna get
outdoors to have fun is go to the park.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.230
A park is a great place to go, it’s a great
place to take kids, it’s a great place to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.790
take your dog.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.680
When you go to the park you can go by yourself.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.150
You can take a blanket and just enjoy being
outside while reading a book.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.170
Maybe with a friend you’ll take a frisbee
and you’ll play catch.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.270
Maybe you’re even playing frisbee with your
dog.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.980
And for sure if there is playground attached
to the park, you can take your children, you

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.790
can take your kids and they can enjoy some
time playing on the playground.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.400
The park is a great place to go when you wanna
do something outdoors.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.840
A third thing you might do when wanting to
get outdoors to have fun, is to go to the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.930
beach.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.340
The beach is a great place to go.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.510
At the beach obviously you’ll find lots
of water to go swimming in.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.560
You’ll find lots of sand and you’ll be
able to put your towel down, or a blanket

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.730
down on the sand and soak up some rays.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.470
Soaking up some rays just means sitting in
the sun or laying in the sun.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.320
You’ll be able to go swimming.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.700
You’ll be able to just enjoy cooling off
in the water.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.500
A lot of times in English when we go swimming
we enjoy cooling off in the water.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.570
And then enjoying basking in the sunlight.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.280
The beach is a great place to go.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.040
It’s also a great place to play some football,
to play some frisbee, or to play some volleyball

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.710
if those are the kinds of sports that you
like doing at the beach.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.210
The only thing I don’t like about the beach
is when it gets too hot.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.500
I don’t like it when it’s super hot at
the beach.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.090
I like it when the water’s fresh.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.930
That means the temperature that’s not too
cold.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.510
It’s cool enough to cool me off.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.060
And I don’t like it if it’s too hot at
the beach, but I certainly do like going.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:29.090
A fourth thing you might do outside to have
fun is to go for a ride, or a drive.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.240
You might decide that you like biking, and
you might decide to go for a bike ride.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.040
A bike ride is when you get out your bike,
you jump on your bike, and you pedal around

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.430
town or through some country roads to just
enjoy some time outside while cycling.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.470
The cool part about cycling is that it allows
you to get places fairly quickly and the part

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.130
I like about cycling is that when you’re
going downhill, you don’t have to pedal.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.530
So it’s a little easier to do for me.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.100
You might also have a nice car.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.720
And you want to go for a drive.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.590
So you might go for a bike ride.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.650
You might take out your car and go for a drive.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.530
Going for a drive is beautiful as well, you
can enjoy the countryside, you can go to local

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.510
towns that you haven’t visited.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.690
But sometimes it’s just enjoyable when you
want to get outside to go for a drive.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.250
And years ago I had a motorcycle.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.880
Going out for a ride on a motorcycle is super
fun as well.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.380
So you might go for a ride ON a bike, you
might go for a drive IN a car, or you might

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.650
go for a ride ON a motorcycle or a motorbike.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.590
Notice the difference there: You ride ON a
bike.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.280
You ride IN a car.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.960
And you ride ON a motorcycle.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.770
The last thing, the fifth thing, that you
might do if you wanna go outside to have some

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.400
fun is to go camping.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.410
Now this is one that I wasn’t sure I was
going to put in the video because I myself

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.720
do not like camping.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.620
Camping is when you go to a campground and
you bring a tent and you bring all of your

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.200
camping supplies, and you basically live in
nature for a few days.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.650
So you set up your tent.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.620
You sleep in your tent.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.410
You cook all of your food outside.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.419
You probably have a fire pit where you can
cook food, and where you can sit around the

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.510
fire at night.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.020
And you most likely will also have a picnic
table on your campsite.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.640
So notice all of the English words I used
there: Campground is the place where you go

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.550
to camp.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.699
Campsite is the small place where you’re
allowed to put your tent.

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:56.449
And picnic table, fire pit, those are all
parts of a campsite and camping.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.210
I don’t really enjoy camping because sometimes
it’s really warm.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.830
In Ontario Canada there’s lots of mosquitos
that buzz around and bite you.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.300
So I’m not a big fan of mosquitos.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.400
And sometimes it’s just nicer to be in an
air conditioned house, so I do find it kind

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.670
of funny that I’m making a video about enjoyable
things to do outside, when I don’t actually

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.990
have a lot of things myself that I enjoy to
do outside.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.150
But there you have it.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.830
There’s five things that you can do outside
if you like this video, don’t forget to

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.580
give a thumbs up!

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.710
And if you wanna have fun outside now you
know some of the English words and phrases

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.360
that you would need to use to be able to describe
them.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.919
Have an enjoyable day!

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.240
Bob the Canadian here.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.340
Learn English with Bob the Canadian.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.650
And I’ll see you in the next video.
