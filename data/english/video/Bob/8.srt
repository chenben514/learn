Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:10.730
Let's learn English in the Forest!

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.780
Hey welcome to this video.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.081
If this is your first time here don't forget
to click the subscribe button below, it's

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.220
the red button down there, and if at some
point during this video you could give me

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.689
a thumbs up, that would be awesome.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.140
Well hey welcome to this video, it is kind
of fun to be out here in nature today.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.090
We're gonna talk about the season of Fall
and we're gonna talk about it out here in

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.090
the forest.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.800
In Canada we have four seasons.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.920
We have Winter when the snow flies and it's
really really cold.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.100
We have Spring when everything starts to grow
and the trees get leaves back on them again.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.239
We have Summer when everything grows like
crazy, that means it grows a lot!

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.489
And it's really really hot.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.520
And we have Fall or Autumn.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.149
It has two names in English.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.109
Generally we use the term, "Fall" and I think
"Fall" became popular because in the, in the

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.990
Fall leaves fall off the trees.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.719
So you'll see in the path behind me there's
just all kinds of leaves that have fallen

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.630
from the trees.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.299
In the Fall trees turn from their normal green
colour to brown, red, orange, yellow, and

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.710
all the shades in between and it's really
a beautiful season to be outside.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.700
So in English we have three words to describe
the forest.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.340
We have, "forest".

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.670
We have, "woods".

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.899
And we have, "bush".

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.009
In my area of Ontario, Canada we generally
use the term, "bush".

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.700
If I was to say to someone, "I'm going out
to the forest to go for a walk."

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.880
They might look at me funny, because we don't
use the word, "forest" a lot in this area.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.890
But if I said, "I'm going out to the bush
to go for a walk."

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.909
They would understand what I'm talking about.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.690
I thought I'd stop for a minute and tell you
why we have a maple leaf on our flag, why

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.311
the flag of Canada has a maple leaf.

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:07.509
It's because we have maple trees and maple
leaves everywhere.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.979
On the ground around me there's just all these
nice red maple leaves that have fallen off

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.310
a tree.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.569
So because there's so many maple trees we
decided to use the maple leaf, which is the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.030
leaf from the maple tree on our flag.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.660
So, â€¦.. Now you know!

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.959
So you can see behind me that a lot of leaves
fall off the trees in the Fall.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.290
If we were in town, if we were in the city,
we would have to rake these leaves up into

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.140
a pile and often people rake leaves into a
pile and then their kids jump into the pile

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.140
for fun.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.140
It's a pretty common thing for young Canadian
kids to do.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.260
So there's three main reasons why you might
come out to the woods, or the forest.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.769
You might be someone who is a avid hunter.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.030
That's someone who really likes hunting for
animals, maybe with a bow and arrow.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.060
It's possible that you just like to go on
a hike or a nature walk.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.879
And it's also possible that you're coming
out to the forest to cut down trees for firewood.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.720
In Canada we still have a lot of people that
use wood to heat their houses in the winter.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.360
So it's pretty common to come out to the forest
or the woods to cut down trees for firewood.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.060
Usually when you do that you have a chainsaw.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.780
I'll put a picture up here of a chainsaw.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.590
And you have what we call a log splitter in
order to split the pieces of wood into firewood,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.379
and then that firewood is used in a wood burning
stove to heat their home.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.910
So there's really two kinds of trees that
you'll find in the forest.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.049
There's deciduous trees.

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.750
Those are trees where the leaves turn colour
and they fall off in the Autumn or Fall.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.110
Deciduous trees are trees like, maple, or
oak, or poplar.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.160
There's also coniferous trees.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.560
Coniferous trees are trees that have needles
instead of leaves, and they stay green year

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.560
round.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.360
The needles don't fall off in the winter.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.280
A few examples of coniferous trees are trees
like spruce, or pine, or cedar.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.840
So I'm in a clearing right now.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.640
A clearing is an area where there's no trees,
and I thought this would be a good time to

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.300
go over the parts of the tree.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.880
The part of the tree that's underground, way
down there underground, is called the roots.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.900
This right here, this right here is called
the trunk.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.350
And the, the skin of the trunk is called the
bark.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:45.640
Up there you have a branch, and if we look
even higher you'll see some twigs, which are

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.320
small branches, and you'll see the leaves.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.040
So there's also the parts of the tree that
we refer to after it has been cut down or

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.980
after it has died.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.810
This is a stick.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.420
This is a log.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.600
Logs are generally used to make lumber to
build houses.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.510
And sticks are used for, well, just about
everything including roasting marshmallows

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.700
on a fire, or maybe hot dogs.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.440
So after a tree gets cut down the part of
the tree that's left we call a tree stump.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.640
So this is a tree stump from a tree that was
cut down, probably with a chainsaw, and there's

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.810
another one over here where we have a tree
stump and someone did a carving on the top.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.430
A cute little bear.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.600
So this is a tree stump.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.460
This is a wood carving.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.780
So there's a variety of animals that you'll
find in the forest.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.510
You'll obviously find birds.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.620
I don't know if you can hear these birds up
in the these trees here.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.120
They're being pretty loud.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.850
But generally in this part of Ontario all
we really see are maybe the odd squirrel,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.660
or maybe the odd chipmunk.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.010
There's also a few raccoons, but generally
we don't see bigger animals like bears.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.950
Thank goodness.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.030
But there is some deer.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.180
From time to time we will see deer.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.560
I'm not sure if you can hear it right now,
but it's really nice in the Fall because the

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.470
leaves rustle as the wind blows through them.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.670
In English we say, "rustling" when two things
kind of rub together in the wind.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:34.520
I'll just stop talking for a minute and we
can listen to the rustling of the leaves.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.750
Hopefully you could hear it.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.900
Well hey that was fun.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.890
Thank you so much for coming to the forest
with me today.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:46.080
I hope this video helped you learn some English
words and phrases that you would use to describe

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.370
the forest.
