Hi Bob the Canadian here, let’s learn English
at the grocery store!

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.700
Hi Bob the Canadian here, if this is your
first time here don’t forget to click the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.090
subscribe button below and give me a thumbs
up at some point during this video if you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.910
enjoy it as you continue to learn English.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.490
Well I was thinking the other day, I really
haven’t taken any of you on a field trip.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.340
A field trip is when a teacher takes students
somewhere outside of the classroom.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.610
Normally you would learn in a classroom, but
sometimes the teacher will take students somewhere

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.360
and that’s called a field trip.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.890
So today I thought we would go on a field
trip to the supermarket or what we usually

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.550
call in English the grocery store.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:59.710
Let me get my keys!

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.570
So in English we generally use the term, “grocery
store”.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.260
We don’t often use the term, “supermarket”
I know supermarket is quite common in other

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.330
languages, in French we say, “supermarché”
but in English we don’t often say supermarket.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.820
It is an English word but we usually say grocery
store.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.420
And you could say for instance, “I have
to stop at the grocery store.”

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.270
You could say, “I need to pick up some groceries.”

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.720
You could say, “I need to go to the grocery
store.”

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.230
And you could also say, “I need to go grocery
shopping.”

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.600
So that’s pretty common.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.110
I need to get some food, so I’m going to
go grocery shopping.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:52.690
So let’s head over there!

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.159
Well we made it, I’m at my local grocery
store and I thought I would take you guys

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.479
inside and we’ll look at each section of
the grocery store and I’ll kind of tell

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.100
you what the name of the section is, and some
of the items that you can buy there.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.630
So let’s go on inside.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.840
One of the first things we’re gonna need
is a shopping cart otherwise known as a grocery

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
cart.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.480
Let’s grab one from right here.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.090
Now we’re ready.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.560
The very first section of the grocery store
that you’ll see, especially in a Canadian

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.060
grocery store is the produce section.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.730
So the produce section is the section where
you’ll find fruits, the kinds of things

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.970
that grow on trees like apples, oranges, bananas.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.099
By the way if you are from a country that
produces bananas just a big, “THANK YOU!”

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.420
from me I love bananas.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.490
I eat one everyday.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.110
But yeah you can see the sign up here we’re
in the produce section so you’re gonna find

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.110
a lot of fruit.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.650
You’re also gonna find a lot of vegetables.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.620
You’re gonna find things like carrots and
cucumbers and broccoli and those kinds of

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.620
things.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.810
So first section you usually see - the produce
section.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.930
Lots of fruits.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.930
Lots of vegetables.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.330
Let’s move on to the deli section.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.150
The next section you’ll usually find in
a Canadian grocery store is the deli section.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.400
And the deli section is where you would find
what we call luncheon meat or deli meat or

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.709
sliced meat.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.660
And this is the kind of meat that you buy
pre-sliced so that you can put them on sandwiches

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.270
or buns or subs - sub sandwiches.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.890
So the deli section is things like ham, things
like bologna, and things like oven roasted

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.270
chicken or oven roasted turkey.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.610
So that’s the deli section.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.319
The next section you’ll usually find in
the grocery store is the bakery section.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.680
The bakery section has things like loaves
of bread.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.950
The bakery section would have fresh baked
buns, fresh baked bread, things like french

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.950
bread.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.150
As well as yummier things to eat like cakes,
maybe muffins, and maybe croissants.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.980
Another section you’ll find in the grocery
store is the dairy section.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.530
The dairy section has all things that would
come from cow milk, goat’s milk, or sheep

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.530
milk.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.950
So here you’ll find things like milk, you’ll
find things like butter, and you’ll find

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.390
things like cheese.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.730
Another section at the grocery store is the
frozen food section.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.559
In the frozen food section you’ll find things
like frozen pizzas.

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.239
You’ll find ice cream.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.189
You’ll find frozen fruits and frozen vegetables.

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.409
So all of the parts of the grocery store that
we have visited are on the outside walls of

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:29.249
the grocery store.

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.759
Those sections are on the perimeter, the outside
walls of the store but in the inside of the

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.100
store are aisles like this and these are aisles
of things like cookies, things like bottled

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.930
juice, things like canned goods and there
is usually these really nice signs above each

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.419
aisle you can see them here that help you
know what’s in each aisle.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.029
Well hey that was a quick tour of the grocery
store.

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.360
