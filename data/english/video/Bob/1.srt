00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.310
Hi!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.310
Bob the Canadian here!

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.260
Let’s learn English around the house.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.730
Come on in!

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.330
Hi, Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.410
Welcome to this video.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.529
If this is your first time here don’t forget
to click the subscribe button below, and give

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.439
me a thumbs up at some point during this video
if it’s helping you learn English.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.750
Well today we’re going to learn some English
words and phrases that you can use to describe

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.820
a house.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.180
I just came in through the front door.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.800
Houses generally have a front door and a back
door.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.310
I’ll show you that one a bit later.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.020
And I’m standing in the front entrance or
the entranceway of the house.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.660
It’s a little warm so I’m going to take
off my coat and you’ll notice behind me

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.140
there is a coat hanger.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.170
So I’m going to hang my coat here and I’m
going to do what we traditionally do in Canada,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.200
and that is that I’m going to take off my
shoes.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.049
Before we go any further though, I want to
thank Barb the Canadian for letting me use

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.810
her house today to make this video, to help
you learn English.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.009
The front entranceway also usually has a closet
where you can hang coats and other items.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.890
So especially in the winter when you come
into a home you might want to hang your coat

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.990
in the closet if there’s not enough room
on the coat hangers.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.009
So you’ll notice behind me here the kitchen.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.869
The kitchen is one of my favourite rooms in
the house.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.060
I really like food so I really like kitchens.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.530
You’ll notice behind me here that a kitchen
has a certain number of items.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.789
We have the refrigerator or the fridge, where
you can keep food cold.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.049
This fridge has a freezer on the bottom.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.219
We also have the stove and generally we call
this part the oven, where you would bake things,

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.869
and over here we have the stove where you
would cook things.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.959
If you look behind me here you’ll see we
have a sink, so when you’re all done making

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.459
your food and eating your food you can do
the dishes, you can wash the dishes in the

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.459
sink.

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.530
And if you look over here on the counter you’ll
notice that we have three things that you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.440
find quite often in a kitchen.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.010
We have a coffee maker.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.489
We have a kettle for boiling water, and we
have a pitcher of water if you just want to

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.910
drink some water.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.310
Up here you’ll notice that we have cupboards,
so cupboards, notice it’s not pronounced

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.650
the way it looks.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:52.840
In a cupboard you’ll find things like plates
and bowls that you can use for eating.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.140
Those are pretty loud!

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.450
And if we look over here, we’ll have what
we in Canada call a utensil drawer.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.770
So this is drawer where you would keep spoons,
forks, and knives.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:16.079
You’ll also see this area here is what we
would call the counter or the countertop.

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.269
You can use both words interchangeably.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.489
So you might use the countertop or the counter
to prepare food.

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.140
And you’ll notice hiding over here in the
corner we have a microwave, just a small appliance

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.800
that lets you heat up food really really quickly.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.420
So that’s the kitchen.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.450
One of my favourite rooms.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.780
Let’s move on to the living room.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.280
So we’re in the living now.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.890
The living room is the room in the home where
you will usually find chairs and sofas or

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.650
what we also call couches.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.329
It’s the room where, when you just want
to relax, this is the room that you would

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.079
generally sit in.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.590
Maybe you want to read a book, maybe you want
to watch tv or if we look over here you’ll

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.689
see that this living room also has a tv, a
television, where you could sit just to have

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:15.350
a quiet relaxing evening where you are going
to entertain yourself by reading a book, maybe

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.030
sitting and talking with friends, or watching
some television.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.240
So that’s the living room.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.650
Let’s look at the dining room next.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.190
So another, another part of the house that
I really like is the dining room.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.900
So this is a room with a table specifically
for eating meals.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.949
So you would have breakfast, lunch, and supper
at this table in the dining room.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.350
You can tell that Christmas is coming soon,
I’ll do a video soon about Christmas.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.380
I think next week I’m going to a parade
and I’ll show you whole bunch of stuff about

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.860
Christmas, but this is the dining room.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.970
We have a dining room table and we have chairs
to sit at as we would eat our meals.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.690
So we’re in the bathroom now, and there’s
really three main parts to a bathroom.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.699
We have a sink where you could wash your hands
so you could turn on the water and wash your

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:09.729
hands.

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.350
We also have, if I turn just a little bit,
behind me here we have a shower.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.000
So you could jump in here to have a shower
maybe at the end of a long day of work, and

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.110
then we also have, I’m not gonna describe
what this is for, but we also have a toilet.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.880
I think everyone in the world knows what this
is for and how to use it, so I’m not gonna

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.581
spend any time describing it.

00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:34.419
But you have a toilet.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.569
This is the toilet seat.

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:42.430
You have toilet paper and this is where you
would go if you felt the call of nature.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.280
That’s the nice way of putting it.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.700
So we’re in the upstairs of the house now,
you’ll notice that we’re in a bedroom.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.780
So there’s a good reason why it’s called
a bedroom.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.889
It’s because, there’s a bed!

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.789
So in a bedroom you’re going to have a bed.

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:01.380
You’re also going to have things that in
English we call dressers.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.569
So if you look over here there is a dresser
and a dresser is a place where using these

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.699
drawers, this is where you would store all
of your clothes.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.240
So in a bedroom you generally have a bed,
which is right here, and you have a dresser

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.530
where you can store stuff.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.300
There’s also in this bedroom what we would
call night tables.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.000
So there’s a table on each side of the bed
with a small lamp.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.819
This is a place where you could keep a book
if you read at night before you go to bed.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.789
You would keep it on your night stand, or
night table.

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:39.789
So this is a bedroom.

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:46.129
I’m not sure how easy this is to see, but
I’m standing in a hallway.

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:52.289
So a hallway is the part of the home that
connects all of the rooms together.

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:53.289
This room is empty.

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.330
In English we would call this a spare room.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.580
Sometimes a spare room has an extra bed in
it.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.009
This room is just empty so we would call this
a spare room.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:11.349
I just came down these stairs and I’m now
in the basement of this house.

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:19.580
A basement is the part of the house that is
below ground, and many times in a home the

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.610
basement is used to store things.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.319
It also usually has a furnace.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:29.550
This is what heats the home with gas or oil
in the winter.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.510
And a hot water heater.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.889
This is what makes hot water for the house
as well.

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.099
And usually those types of things are found
in a basement.

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:41.060
So we’re here in the basement, it’s the
part that’s below ground.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.669
I’ll just show you a window over here for
a sec so that you get a sense of where we

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:46.669
are.

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:51.819
So here’s the basement window, it’s a
little hard to see, but if you look outside

00:07:51.819 --> 00:08:04.509
you’ll notice the we are at ground level,
or below ground level in the basement here.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:08.010
So a lot of Canadian homes will also have
a garage.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:14.700
A garage is a place where you can keep your
car, and a garage has a garage door which

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.150
you just saw open behind me.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.360
As well a garage sometimes has a garage door
opener.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.159
This is a device that’s on the ceiling of
the garage, and I’ll just show you for a

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:33.900
sec, this is a device that’s on the ceiling
of a garage that opens the door automatically

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.630
when you click the button in your car.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.120
So that’s a garage door opener.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:46.190
It’s a little cold to be out here with no
coat on but I just wanted to show you earlier

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.980
I mentioned the back door.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.750
This is the back door of the house.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.890
When you have a back door a lot of times you’ll
have a barbecue outside and then also down

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.779
here there’s just kind of a patio area.

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:03.520
So there’s an area where you can come out
to cook some food in the summer months when

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.520
it’s warmer.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.690
You can come out your backdoor.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.870
You can go down your steps, and you can use
your barbecue to cook some food.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.720
So this is a small patio area outside the
back door.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.860
Well, hey, thanks for joining me today to
