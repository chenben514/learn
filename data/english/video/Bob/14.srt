Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.780
Sometimes when you know you're going to have
an English conversation, it's a good idea

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.830
to think about the things that you're going
to talk about.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.639
One thing that's really easy to talk about
is to ask people about some of their favourite

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:16.639
things.

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:21.689
In this video I'll help you learn some English
questions and responses to be able to talk

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.689
about your favourite things and to be able
to ask people about theirs.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.200

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.150
or to give me a thumbs up at some point along
the way.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.180
So.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.510
You're going to be having a conversation in
English and it's a good idea to plan some

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.000
things to talk about in advance.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.850
One of the easiest things to plan for is to
be able to ask people about their favourite

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.870
things, and be ready to answer with your favourite
things.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.190
So let's look at a few of them.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.270
The first thing you might ask someone is,
"What is you favourite colour?" a faster version

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.299
of that question would be, "What's your favourite
colour?"

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.469
And in reverse someone may ask you the same
question.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.929
What's your favourite colour?

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.109
So let's look at what my favourite colour
is.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.170
Here's how I would answer if you asked me
that question.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.359
Hey Bob the Canadian, what's your favourite
colour?

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.729
My favourite colour is orange.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.900
But we shouldn't just stop there.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.350
If you ask someone about their favourite colour,
or if someone asks you about it, you should

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.999
be able to also ask, "Why?"

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.709
and answer, "Why?"

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.750
So why is orange my favourite colour?

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.220
Well orange is my favourite colour because
when I was really little in school the teacher

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.499
was asking everyone what their favourite colour
was.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.149
And no one was saying orange.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.479
And I kinda felt bad.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.420
So I said orange was my favourite colour.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.279
As you can tell it still is today.

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:03.869
If you look at my thumbnails and my Youtube
channel, it's all in orange.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.549
It's still one of my favourite colours.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.730
Another thing when talking about favourites
that's very common to ask is, "What's your

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.730
favourite place?"

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.220
What’s your favourite place to go?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.890
And to answer you would say, “Ah my favourite
place to go is…”

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.030
So let’s do this, let’s ask me Bob the
Canadian, what is your favourite place to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.030
go?

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.220
Well my favourite place to go, of all things,
is nowhere.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.700
My favourite place to go is to go home.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.500
So when I’m somewhere else, my favourite
place is to be home.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.330
Another thing that you can ask people about
or someone may ask you about is, “What is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.340
your favourite food?”

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.370
What’s your favourite food?

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.120
If someone was to ask me this question I would
say my favourite food is pizza.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.010
I have loved pizza for a very, very long time.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.340
And if someone was to ask, “Why, Bob the
Canadian, is pizza your favourite food?”

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.590
or “Why’s pizza your favourite food?”

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.230
I would have to say when I was little kid,
again, on Friday nights my mom would make

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.730
homemade pizza.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.120
And we would get eat homemade pizza and it
was very very very tasty.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.440
So for my whole life I have always loved pizza.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.590
Another thing that people may ask you about
in terms of favourites, or you may ask someone

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.190
else is, “What’s your favourite movie?

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.010
What’s your favourite T.V.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.010
show?”

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.920
So many of us go see movies, many of us have
seen movies that we liked, we have seen movies

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.570
that we didn’t like, but sometimes there’s
movies that are our favourites.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.260
If someone was to ask me, “Hey Bob the Canadian,
what’s your favourite movie?”

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.210
I would have to say my favourite movie is
any of the Lord of the Rings movies.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.120
In particular, I like the very first Lord
of the Rings movie.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.210
So if someone was to ask, “Hey Bob the Canadian,
what’s your favourite movie?”

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.010
I would say The Lord of the Rings.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.770
Another thing that people might ask in addition
to what’s your favourite movie is, “Who

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.410
is your favourite actor of actress?”

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.340
Who’s your favourite actor Bob the Canadian?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.370
I would have to say, my favourite actor is
Matt Damon.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.900
Most movies that have Matt Damon in it are
movies that I have liked.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.460
In particular I liked all of the Jason Bourne
movies, and I really liked the movie The Martian.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.780
So Matt Damon is my favourite actor.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.370
Why is he my favourite actor?

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.970
I think because I like action movies.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.850
I like movies where there’s a really fast
good storyline, and usually Matt Damon is

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.639
in those kinds of movies.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.940
The last favourite, the last question that
people might ask about your favourites is,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.570
“Who’s your favourite person?”

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.000
And this is a tricky one, because you have
to be careful when you’re talking about

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.790
who your favourite person is.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.120
My favourite person in the world is my wife
for obvious reasons.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.561
I don’t think I need to give any, but people
might ask things like, “Who’s your favourite

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.780
student?”

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.590
To which I would not give an answer because
I don’t think it’s a good idea to choose

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.870
favourites among students.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.060
If someone was to ask me, “Which of your
children is your favourite?”

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.560
I would probably just say, I would probably
just say, “I love them all equally.”

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.080
So that’s a number of questions about favourites,
and a number of answers that I’ve given

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.370
about favourites.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.310
Your job now is to think about if you had
to answer those questions, how would you answer

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.310
them?
