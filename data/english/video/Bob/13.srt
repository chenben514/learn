00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.850
Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.839
Sometimes as you learn English you want to
be able to describe the things that you do

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.550
for fun.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.250
In this video we’ll look at several words
and phrases that you can use in English to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.900
describe the things you would do for fun if
you stayed in instead of going out for the

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.900
night.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.239

when I do a livestream, and for everyone watching

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.000
if this video helps please give me a thumbs
up at the end and that would be great.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.640
So, you don’t feel like going out.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.650
One of the first things you might do if you
stay home for the evening is watch television.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.360
So we describe this in a number of ways now
you can “Watch Television” you can “Watch

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.780
TV” you might “Watching Netflix” you
might even be “Watching Youtube” and the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.420
place you would do this is most likely in
a room that in English we would call the “Living

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
room”.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.670
Some people might call it the “Family room”.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760
Some people might call it the “Den”.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.370
But it is the room in the house where you’ve
most likely placed your television.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.510
On your television you’ll watch things like
“Television shows”.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.400
A show come in a “series”.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.930
So if you watch a television “series”
it mean you’re watching a bunch of television

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.150
“shows” in succession.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.290
Or you could be watching a Netflix “series”.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.960
All of those would appropriate words to describe
it.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.520
You will most likely be sitting on your couch
or sofa.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.000
You may have a “comfortable chair” that
you like to sit in.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.830
You will have in your hand your “remote
control” so that you can pause and go get

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.210
“snacks” which brings me to the last thing
you will most likely if you’re staying in

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.670
for the evenings have some “snacks” and
something to drink as you watch your television

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.220
show or a television series.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.410
You may also be watching Netflix, and a new
term, a new English term that’s just become

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.410
popular in the last few years is something
called “binge watching”.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.210
“Binge watching” is when you watch a whole
bunch of “episodes” of a show back to

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.610
back, in succession.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.690
So you might watch episode 1, 2, 3, and 4
in one night and that would be “binge watching”

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.720
that television show.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.690
You might also be watching a film, you might
be watching a movie or film.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.100
We use those words interchangeably.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.880
You may have rented a “blu-ray” or a “dvd”.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.780
Or you might be streaming the video through
something like Youtube or Google Play.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.989
So those of the things, number one, those
are the things you could do if you’re just

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.310
staying home to watch TV for the evening.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.690
Number two, the second thing you could do,
if you’re staying in for the evening.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.660
Playing a video game.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.190
So again you could do this in an number of
different places in your home.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.569
You might be playing a video game on your
computer.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.300
So you might be sitting at your desk in your
home office and you may be playing a computer

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.030
game on your computer.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.430
We use the terms “video game” and “computer
game” kind of interchangeably.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.170
They kind of mean the same thing.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.060
So you may be sitting in your office playing
a “computer game”.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.390
You may also be in the same room where you
watched television.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.700
You may be in your “living room” or “family
room”.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.980
And you might be playing a video game on “console”.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.590
So a “console” is something like a “playstation”
or an “xbox” or a “nintendo wii”.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.239
So you may be playing a video game at your
computer in your office.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.260
You may be playing a video game in your living
room.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.610
But you may also just be sitting somewhere
comfortable on your smartphone and playing

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.750
a video game on your smartphone.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.720
Video games in general have things like “levels”.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.000
They have “characters” and so as you play
your video game you try to get a “high score”

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.560
or a good “score”.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.750
You try to not die in your video game, and
that would be a video game where you’re

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.250
playing with a “character”.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.220
Something like Mario Brothers.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.389
But perhaps you’re playing something else
like Candy Crush or Tetris.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.890
And in those video games you’re simply trying
to get further then you did the time previous.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.410
So, the second thing you might do when you’re
in for the evening is you might just sit down

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.560
somewhere comfortable and play a video game.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.080
You might have snacks, you might have something
to drink, but you certainly are just going

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.590
to find a comfortable place, pull out your
smartphone or your laptop and play a video

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.020
game.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.610
The third thing you might do if you stay in
for the evening is read.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.780
Reading is such an enjoyable activity for
me.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.470
Normally if I stay in for the night, it is
my first choice of something to do.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.810
I love reading books.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.590
Another English word for book is “novel”.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.169
So I like to sit down with a good book or
novel and just read.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.810
I have a really nice chair, a reading chair,
where I like to do that.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.979
A “reading chair”, there’s nothing special
about it, it’s just the chair that I like

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.290
to sit in when I read.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.530
If you chose to stay in for the evening, other
English words for things you could read are,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.530
“newspaper”.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.449
A “newspaper” as you can see in the picture,
is a print daily edition of the news.

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.711
You may also be reading a “magazine”.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.740
Magazines generally come once a month.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.290
And the last thing you might be, you may be
reading a book on a “kindle” or some sort

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.729
of “e-book” reading device.

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.650
I have just recently started reading books
as e-books.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.949
I’m, I think I like real books better, but
“e-books” as well are a way to stay in

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:12.479
for the evening and something fun to do, read
a book.

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.380
The fourth thing you might do, if you’re
staying in for the evening to have fun, is

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.820
to play a “board game” or to do a “puzzle”.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.000
So for instance if you were to play a “board
game” you would most likely play either

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.120
at the “kitchen table”, which is usually
the largest table in the house, and works

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.840
well for “board games”.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.009
Or you might play a game of “cards” at
a special table called a “card table”.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.270
Either way, this requires that there’s other
people.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.470
And it’s really a fun way to stay in for
the evening.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.500
You may play games like, “monopoly”.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.139
You may play games like, “bridge”.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.630
You may be playing games like, “scrabble”.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.819
By the way if you haven’t played “scrabble”
you should play scrabble and try to only do

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:00.819
English words.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.800
It’s a really great way to practice your
English.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.120
This is a fun way to stay in for the evening.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.490
It has the added benefit of that it doesn’t
cost any money.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.580
And as with everything else I’ve mentioned
so far.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.990
It’s usually fun to have some “snacks”
while you’re playing and something to go

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.630
along with it.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.150
So staying in, if you have enough people in
your home or apartment.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.919
It sometimes can be fun to stay in and play
a game.

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:34.610
The fifth thing that you might do if you’re
staying in for the evening is listening to

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.420
some music.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.180
Perhaps you just wanna kick back, which means
to relax, perhaps you just want to kick back

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.970
and listen to some music.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.490
You may do that in a number of ways.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.990
You may have a “stereo system” with “speakers”.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.120
Or you may have a “radio” with “speakers”.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.461
And perhaps you have a room in your house
where you have this “sound system” and

00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:05.080
you just play music and you sit back and you
listen to the music with your eyes closed.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.310
Maybe you sing along, but you just enjoy listening
to the music.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:14.639
A second way that you may listen to the music
is perhaps you have a smartphone and you have

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:18.030
“headphones” or “earbuds”.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:24.669
And you just plug yourself in, put your headphones
on, or put your earbuds in, and play some

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:26.060
music.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.919
In English, we use words like, listen to a
“song”.

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:32.810
Listen to a “playlist”.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.120
You may listen a collection of music.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.279
People who are older like myself, you may
listen to an “album” which is a collection

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:44.509
of music from the same “artist”.

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:49.819
You may listen to “singers” or you may
listen to music from a “band”.

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:54.170
So there’s a variety of ways to describe
music in English, but generally if you’re

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.220
staying in for the evening just to have an
enjoyable evening in and you like music you

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.579
will most likely listen to some of your favourite
music in one of your favourite places to sit

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:07.579
in the house.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:13.249
A sixth thing that you might do if you’re
staying in for the evening is “crossword

00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:20.709
puzzles” or “sudokus” or other kinds
of small puzzles that you do by yourself.

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:26.060
“Crossword puzzles” a lot of times come
in a newspaper.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.339
Sometimes people cut them out and keep them
around.

00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:36.120
You may also buy small books that have a number
of “crosswords puzzles” “word searches”

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.759
or “sudokus”.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:42.610
Now if your learning English “crossword
puzzles” and “word searches” are also

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.860
good ways to practice your English words.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.720
You can use a crossword to get a hint.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.779
A crossword puzzles gives you a hint so that
you can figure what word goes horizontally

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:59.119
or vertically into the puzzle.

00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:04.730
A “word search” gives you the list of
words and you need circle the words in this

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.529
huge box of letters.

00:10:08.529 --> 00:10:11.920
So it’s extremely difficult to find them.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.949
The seventh and last thing that you might
do if you are staying in for the evening to

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:20.670
have fun is just connecting with someone else.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:26.839
You might sit down at your desk and write
a letter using a pen and paper.

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:31.170
You might decide that you haven’t sent a
letter to a friend who lives in another country

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.629
for a long time.

00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:37.550
And you might sit down and you might say,
“Dear John, it’s been a while, I hope

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.290
things are going well.”

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.600
If you’re more modern you might sit down
at your computer and you may read an email

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.829
or two from a friend and you might decide
to send an email to a friend.

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:57.639
This is much faster, sometimes I think that
letters are are more interesting way to communicate,

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:59.649
because you need to wait.

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:02.149
Email is very, very rapid.

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:04.069
You might “text” a friend.

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:07.670
You might take out your smartphone and “text”
a friend.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:13.269
You may just go on the internet and go on
“social media” sites like Facebook and

00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:16.689
just check to see who’s up to what.

00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:22.790
What friend is doing what, and maybe you will
“instant message” them via Facebook or

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.309
“direct message” them via other platforms.

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:31.959
So you might spend the evening in even though
you’re not being social, you may spend the

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:40.889
evening in socializing in certain way by writing
a letter or email or text to someone.

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:44.860
So that’s the video on things you can do
if you’re staying in for fun.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.209
Please remember if you liked this video to
give me a thumbs up, that would be awesome.

Hit the bell icon if you want notifications.

00:11:57.209 --> 00:12:02.839
This a video in a series, so I’m going to
do a series of five videos of things you can

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:04.519
do for fun.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:06.679
So look for those coming up in the next few
weeks.

00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:08.109
I’ll try to do one a week.

00:12:08.109 --> 00:12:09.660
Bob the Canadian here.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.019
Learn English with Bob the Canadian.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:17.970
I really hope you enjoyed this video and have
a great day.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.889
Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:24.220
It’s just a little too bright outside to
shoot a video, so I’m going to head up into

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.220
upstairs of the barn.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.940
We’re gonna talk about fun things to do
when you’re staying in for the night.
