Hi! Bob the Canadian here. Let’s learn English….

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.620
Well that’s not very nice!

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.870
Let’s learn English at the shopping mall.
Hey welcome to this video. If this is your

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.120
first time here don’t forget to click the
subscribe button below. And if you don’t

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.930
mind at some point during this video give
me a thumbs up. Let’s head into the mall.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.180
So one of the first things I like to look
for when I walk into the entrance of a mall

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.570
is the map and the list of stores. If you
look down here it will list all of the stores

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.390
that are in the mall, and you can find the
particular store that you’re looking for

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.191
with it’s number. So for instance if I wanted
to go to Shoppers Drug Mart. It’s store

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:49.720
number 8. I can then look at the map and find
store number 8. There should also be a “You

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.140
Are Here.” type of thing. Why can’t I
find it? Oh it’s over here. It’s a little

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.940
hard for me sometimes to think quickly. But,
“You are Here” so I know that I came in

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.080
this entranceway and I’m standing right
here right now.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.970
So I should say though that often I’ll just
refer to the shopping mall as a mall. In English

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.910
we often have short forms for different words.
We don’t often actually say the word, “shopping

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.030
mall”. We usually just say mall. I’m going
to the mall. I’m going to get some things

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.210
at the mall.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.470
And there’s a couple different kinds of
stores at the mall. If you look behind me

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.770
there’s a traditional type of store, but
if you look right here there’s something

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.230
that we would call a “kiosk”. This particular
kiosk looks like it sells cell phones.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.229
Probably the store that you’ll find the
most often at the mall is a clothing store.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.030
I think in this mall almost probably ¾ of
the stores are actually clothing stores.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.460
Other types of stores are things like, behind
me over here there’s a card store, and over

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.549
here there is a game store, a video game store,
and if you look way, oh, there’s another

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.759
clothing store, and if you look way down there,
there’s a cell phone store. So those are

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.910
some of the typical types of stores that you’ll
find at a mall.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.189
This is where my kids always wanna stop when
we’re at the mall. But I always say no.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:16.560
Am I a mean dad? And they always wanna stop
here too and I say no again.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.519
So behind me here you’ll see a shoe store.
There’s usually two or three shoe stores

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.900
in a mall. I don’t buy shoes very often
so it’s not a store that I go into a lot.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.400
But let’s walk for a bit and I’ll show
you what my favourite store is.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.599
So behind me is my favourite store, which
a bookstore. I love to read books. I think

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.579
maybe we should go inside and see if they
have a good book to help people learn English.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.049
I don’t know if they do, but I’m just
gonna walk in and ask them, so let’s go.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.310
Just gonna walk to the back and see if there’s
a book section for learning English. If not

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.609
I’ll have to ask someone to help me. Don’t
really see anything like that. Nope. I don’t

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.140
see any books to help learn English.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.269
Do you have any books to help people learn
English and what section would they be in?

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.090
These three books here are the books that
they have to help you learn English. There’s

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.900
only one book that I think I would recommend
is the DK series of books for learning English

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.659
is really good. I think I might actually go
and buy this one just to kind of check it

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:18.659
out.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.049
Pretty much every mall will have a food court
with a seating area, and a food court if I

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.109
just give you a bit of a spin will have all
kinds of different restaurants. They’re

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.379
usually fast food restaurants where you can
get food quickly, but they’re usually located

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.969
somewhere in the centre of the mall and we
call it a food court.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.849
So behind me is my second favorite kind of
store. This is an electronics store and you

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.139
can buy televisions. You can buy cameras.
You can buy radios. You can buy all the stuff

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.900
you’d like that’s electronic. I really
really like that store.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.189
So the other thing that’s very common to
find in a mall is a hair salon. So behind

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.469
me there’s a hair salon. It’s a place
where you can go to get your haircut, to get

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:11.799
your hair done. And I don’t go to this particular
hair salon, I go to a smaller one that costs

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.690
less money, but yeah, behind me at the mall
you can get your haircut while you’re doing

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.450
some shopping.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.970
Some malls in Canada at least actually have
movie theatres right in the mall. So sometimes

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.221
my wife and I will come and do some shopping
and when we’re done shopping we’ll go

00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:32.950
and we’ll see a move while we’re at the
mall. Not every mall in Canada has a movie

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.370
theatre but some malls have movie theatres
built right in where you can go and see a

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.370
movie.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.270
It’s almost Halloween in Canada which is
at the end of October and that’s why they

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.420
have all costumes out here. On Halloween kids
dress up and they go to the neighbours houses

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.850
and they say, “Trick or Treat!” to get
candy and chocolate. So that’s why today

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.190
at the mall you’ll see a lot of stores selling
different types of costumes.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.230
So this store behind me sells shoes and other
athletic gear. If you needed shoes for soccer

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.100
or volleyball or a new pair of shorts I’m
not sure what sport you play, this would be

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.230
the store you would come to. This is actually
the store where I bought my shoes that I’m

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.800
wearing right now.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.690
So a lot of times a mall will have a jewelry
store where you can buy rings, necklaces,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.510
and bracelets. I’m kind of lucky because
Jen the Canadian, my wife, doesn’t actually

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.080
wear a lot of jewelry so I don’t spend a
lot of money at the jewelry store.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.060
What’s kind of cool about this mall is it
actually has a library, a public library built

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.400
in. And next week’s video I’m actually
gonna do a “Learn English Video” at the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.990
library. Not this library, but if you notice
because we live in Canada we have Bibliothèque

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.150
Publique and then down here you’ll see that
it says, “Public Library” because Canada

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.250
is a bilingual country. So we sometimes at
a mall will have a public library where you

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.020
can go and sign out a book.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.840
When you’re at the mall a lot of times you
need some money and even though you can pay

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.860
in most stores with a credit card or a debit
card usually most malls will have one or two

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.210
banks that have bank machines where you can
go to take out some money. In English we call

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.420
it money or cash. So you can usually find
a bank machine where you can take out some

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.570
money and then you can use that money to make
your purchases at the mall.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.300
Well I’m home now, my wallet’s empty.
That’s what happens when I go to the shopping

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.800
mall, or to the mall. I hope you enjoyed this

helpful for you. Subscribe if you haven’t
subscribed yet and please do share this video.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.400
I’m pretty sure next week we’re going
to the library, but we’ll have to wait and

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.670
see because I might do a video where we go
to the forest because in Canada all of the

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.710
leaves are starting to turn colour, all of
the leaves on the trees. Anyways, thanks for

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.690
watching, have a good week.
