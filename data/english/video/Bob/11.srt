Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.680
We’ve all lost things.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.470
You know that time when you just can’t find
what you need.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:14.080
Maybe you’ve lost your car keys, the remote
to your television, or maybe you’ve lost

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.599
your glasses or your sunglasses.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.530
Well in this video I’ll help you learn some
English words and phrases to talk about the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.619
things you’ve lost, and how to ask someone
to help you find them, and then what you say

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.290
when you finally do.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.840
Hey welcome to this video if this is your
first time here don’t forget to click the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.460
subscribe button and the bell icon below and
give me a thumbs up at some point during this

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.260
video as it helps you learn English.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.360
So you’ve lost something.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
The first thing you’re going to want to
do is you’re going to want to declare or

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.000
say what you’ve lost and the simplest way
to do that is to just say that you’ve lost

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.830
So in this situation let’s say I’ve lost
my keys.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.049
I would say, “I lost my keys.”

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.470
Maybe I’m saying it to a family member,
maybe a friend but I want to say to them,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.330
“I lost my keys.”

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.729
You could also say, “I can’t find my keys.”

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.780
“I can’t seem to find my keys.” or maybe
you just want to say, “I need my keys and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.640
I don’t remember where I put them.”

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.189
All of those are great ways to just declare
or to make the statement that you have lost

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.049
your keys.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.200
So while you’re saying that you’ve lost
your keys someone may ask what you’re doing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.579
because you’re probably moving around the
house or apartment quite frantically as you

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.149
search for the item that you’ve lost.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.009
So in that situation, where there’s actually
someone else who might be able to help you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.889
find what you lost you could ask them questions.

00:01:53.889 --> 00:02:00.430
So in English if we wanted to ask someone
to help us find something we could say, “Have

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.999
you seen my sunglasses?”

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.819
So in this situation we’re looking for our
sunglasses.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.800
“Have you seen my sunglasses?”

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.390
Maybe you think that person put them somewhere
and you could say, “Where did you put my

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.010
sunglasses?”

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.330
Usually I lose things and then somehow I think
other people have moved them instead of admitting

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.980
that I put them in a funny spot, sometimes
I just say to someone else, “Where did you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.450
put my sunglasses?”

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.110
You might even ask them, “Could you help
me find my sunglasses?”

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.060
That would be a much nicer thing to say to
someone.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.930
“Hey I’ve lost my sunglasses, could you
help me find my sunglasses?”

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.170
That person may respond by saying a number
of things.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.700
They’ll probably ask you questions to help
you remember where you put them.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.870
They may ask questions like, “Did you look
on your desk?”

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.900
“Did you look by the front door?”

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.670
“Where did you use them last?”

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.590
That’s always a good question.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.790
Especially with keys.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.430
If can remember where you went last with that
vehicle sometimes it helps you remember where

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.850
you put the keys.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.920
“Did you leave them on the kitchen counter?”

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.070
So depending on what you’ve lost the person
may try to kind of help you remember where

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.640
you’ve put them by asking you questions
like that.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.950
Sometimes I leave my keys on the kitchen table.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.890
Sometimes I leave my sunglasses in my vehicle,
in my van, and then I don’t remember that

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.380
I left them there the time before.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.630
And then finally when you do find that item
it’s so fun to say, “Found them!” or

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.300
“Found it!”

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.950
Just to declare especially if someone’s
helping you that you actually found that item,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.180
or maybe you’re by yourself and you still
want to just celebrate and say, “I found

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.180
them!

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.180
Found it!

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
Found them!”

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.350
Both great ways to celebrate finding something.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.280
Well that was some English words and phrases
to help you declare or to state that you’ve

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.190
lost something.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.020
To kind of describe what you’re looking
for, and ways to ask someone to help you nicely

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.560
and sometimes not so nicely to find what you
are looking for and some of the questions

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.930
someone may ask you in English as you’re
looking for something.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.949
