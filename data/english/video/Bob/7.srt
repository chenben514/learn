Hi Bob the Canadian here!

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.930
Let’s learn English at the library!

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.219
Well hey welcome to this video if this is
your first time here and you’re learning

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.890
English don’t forget to click the subscribe
button below and the small bell notification

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.410
so that you know when new videos come out.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.640
And if at some point during this video you
could give me a thumbs up, that would be awesome.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.050
And one more thing, in the description below,
if you scroll down in the description there’s

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.250
actually some bonus material to help you practice
the English that you’re learning in this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.250
video.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.760
But hey, let’s head into the library and
learn some English.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.130
So welcome to the library, if you’re learning
English, books are one of the best things

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.260
that you can use to help improve your English,
and libraries are really cool because they’re

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.880
free to use.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.649
If you have a library card, here’s mine
right here, if you have a library card which

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.549
is free, you can go to your local library
and you can borrow a book.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.950
When you first walk into a library you will
see the front desk and there will be a librarian

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.510
sitting at the front desk.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.970
I’m not a actually a librarian but fun fact,
an interesting thing about Bob the Canadian,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.930
my mom is actually a librarian.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.320
Anyways the front desk is where you will bring
your books in order to check them out, or

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.320
to sign them out.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.690
So once you’ve gone through the library
and you’ve found one or two books to read,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.210
this is the place where you would come to
sign them out.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.490
The librarian will have a little scanner and
they’ll “beep” the book for you.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.799
So in English we say, “scan” or “beep”
because it makes a beeping sound.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.380
They’ll go, “beep” and then that book
will be registered under your name as being

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.380
borrowed.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.630
I’m not sure if you can read this right
here but it says, “Book Return”.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.670
So this is a place where you could put a book
in if you were returning it to the library.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.700
Maybe the librarian is not at their desk.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.950
You could return your book by putting it in
the slot.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.540
Sometimes when you’re going to return your
book to the library, the library’s closed.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.660
But most libraries have a book drop off slot
on the outside of the library.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.900
And you can put your books in here to return
them when the library is closed and you’re

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.980
not able to go inside.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.610
So libraries have a number of different book
sections.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.560
The section that I’m standing in front of
here is called the, “Fiction Section”.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.200
A fiction section has books that have been
written by authors where they have made up

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200
the story.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.090
So they’re not true stories, they’re fictional
stories.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.420
So if you think of books like, “The Martian”
or books like, “The Hitchhiker's Guide to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.560
the Galaxy” they are fiction books and you
would find those books in the fiction section.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.350
Another section that the library will have
is the, “Non-Fiction Section”.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.910
So the non-fiction section is a great place
to get books where you’re just looking for

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.910
information.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.290
For instance, maybe you wanted a book about
the Prime Ministers of Canada, so you would

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.030
come to the non-fiction section to find books
about information like that.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.549
In this area you’ll also find books that
are true stories, so biographies or auto-biographies,

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.069
which are the stories of a person’s life,
stories that are true, as opposed to fiction

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.720
where the stories are not true.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.670
So this is the non-fiction section of the
library.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.470
So over here in this corner is what’s called
the “Reference Section” and these are

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.720
Encyclopedias.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.990
What’s interesting with encyclopedias is
not a lot of people use them anymore.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.159
Most people use websites like Wikipedia or
they use the internet to do their research,

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:05.580
but here we have a couple of encyclopedias
where you could look up information if you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.550
needed to, but I think they’re actually
kind of old.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.250
So another part of the reference section is
a place where you can find dictionaries.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.840
And I wanted to show you this book shelf because
what’s really cool is right here there’s

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.090
a Japanese-English dictionary, a Chinese-English
dictionary, and a Spanish-English dictionary,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.030
and a French-English dictionary, so sometimes
at your local library you’ll be able to

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.350
find dictionaries that will help you learn
words in different languages, or to help you

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.199
learn the English word for the language that
you speak.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.880
Another section of the library is the “Periodicals”
or “Magazine Section” So this is an area

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.550
where you would find monthly publications.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.169
Magazines on different topics.

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.639
If you wanted to learn about cows, if you
wanted to learn how to build things or renovate

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.970
your house this is the place where you would
come to find a magazine that would tell you

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.970
how to do that.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.020
“..which is a monthly magazine which shows
you how to build things you would come to

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020
the magazine…

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.759
Bob the Canadian is not very good at putting
things on the shelf.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.110
Most libraries also have a “Kid’s Section”
where there are only children’s books, so

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.740
kids as well as adults are always welcome
to go to the library to find a book to read.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.620
So another nice thing about the library is
that they have computers, and there’s a

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.640
couple of things that you can use these computers
for.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.080
You can use the computer to browse the internet,
to look things up, or to check your email.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.440
But usually you can also use the computer
at a library to look up where in the library

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.960
you can find the book that you’re looking
for.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.460
So let’s say you knew a specific book that
you wanted to read, you could use the computer

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.400
to look that book up and it would say it’s
in this section, under this author’s name.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.340
It’s important when you’re at the library
to remember that you’re supposed to be quiet.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.980
Shhhh! is something that we say in English
to tell people that they’re being too noisy.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.320
So hopefully when you’re at the library
no one says, “Shhh!” to you.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.160
But generally in a library it’s supposed
to be a quiet place where people can study

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.690
or people can read.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.440
So try to keep it quiet.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.721
So often times a library will have a reading
area where you can sit and read a book, or

00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:28.210
a magazine, or a newspaper.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.979
You don’t always have to borrow a book to
read it, you can go to the library, you can

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.199
find a quiet place to sit and read, and you
can read a book right at the library.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.289
If you’re in a library at a University or
College, they’ll usually have a work area

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.010
where you can study or do homework.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.210
It’ll usually have a power outlet so you
can plug in a laptop or charge your phone,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.060
but going to the library while you’re at
University or College can be a nice quiet

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.259
place to get some homework done.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:02.660
Well, hey, thanks for coming to the library
with me to learn English.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.110
