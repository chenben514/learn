00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi Bob the Canadian here.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.850
You can see behind me that we have quite a
few clouds today.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.309
So I thought I would do a video to help you
learn English and talk about rain and snow

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:21.610
- where rain goes after it falls and kind
of just teach you some English along the way.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.750
So if you look up in the sky behind me you
can see that we have some dark clouds.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.789
We could call these dark clouds.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.699
We could call them rain clouds.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.940
If they were a little bit darker I would probably
call them storm clouds, and two things fall

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
out of the sky, two kinds of water.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.891
We have raindrops, so a raindrop is, is the
smallest little drop of water that falls out

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:50.891
of the sky.

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:58.760
And you can’t quite see it but the other
thing that can fall is snow, and snow falls

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
as snowflakes.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.729
So you can have raindrops that fall out of
the sky and you can have snowflakes.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.909
There’s a couple different kinds of rain
that falls out of the sky.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.299
You can have a drizzle.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.600
A drizzle is when hardly any rain is falling
out of the sky.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.130
You can have a sprinkling.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.710
You can say it’s sprinkling outside.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.390
When it’s sprinkling outside it means that
even bigger drops are falling.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.479
You could have a light shower.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.310
A light shower would be when you almost need
an umbrella if there’s a light shower.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.020
And then you can say it’s pouring rain.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.860
And when it’s pouring rain there is just
a lot of rain.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.939
So if you look right here you can see puddles.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:56.070
After it rains you end up with puddles which
are small pools of water that form on driveways,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.909
in parking lots.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.670
This particular set of puddles that is in
my driveway at home.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.149
And puddles, they kind of stay until the sun
dries them up.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.980
And we call that evaporating.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.410
We say that the sun causes the water to evaporate.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.799
So these puddles, they don’t go anywhere.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.799
The water doesn’t flow anywhere, and we
just have to wait a few days for them to evaporate

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.620
or for them to dry up.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.349
That’s kind of fun!

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:43.060
So if you look way up there on my shed we
have what we call an eavestrough.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.080
An eavestrough is a gutter, it’s a trough
along the side of a building so that when

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.560
it rains the water goes from the roof into
the eavestrough.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:04.459
From there - I’ll zoom up a bit if I can
- from there you’ll see that the eavestrough

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.540
is connected to a downspout.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.739
I’m not sure I went high enough.

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.019
And the downspout takes the water down.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.849
So this over here, this is the downspout.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.430
This one just opens onto the ground.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.850
On my house the downspout goes into a cistern
which is a place where you can store water.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.920
So I’m, I’m standing out here along the
road.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.060
You can see the road over there, and this
right here is what we call a ditch.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.040
So when it rains, when the rain hits the road
over there it flows off the road into the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.310
ditch, and the ditch takes all that water
down the road usually to a stream or river,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.310
we’ll go look at that in a minute.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.690
So a ditch isn’t just something you’ll
find along the road.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.610
You’ll also have ditches in fields.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.569
So this is a small ditch in this field so
that the water has somewhere to go when it

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.879
rains.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.930
So behind me here we have a small stream.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.440
It’s flowing underneath this bridge here
and you can see the stream has fairly fast

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.800
moving water and it’s very shallow.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.950
Streams are usually fairly shallow.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.770
If it was summer and it was warmer you could
walk through the stream because it’s only

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.630
about this deep.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.220
So we would call this a stream, you can also
call it a brook.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.190
And if you’ve ever heard the the term “a
babbling brook”, if I stop talking for a

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.190
minute here you’ll be able to hear this
stream makes kind of a babbling sound so let’s,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.530
let’s listen to it, not the car going over
the bridge.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.420
So hopefully you could hear that a bit as
the water flows over the rocks, it’s like

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.200
the stream is talking a little bit.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.161
So behind me you’ll see what we call a pond.

00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.400
I’m not sure exactly how to describe a pond.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.310
It’s definitely bigger than a puddle, and
it’s smaller than a lake.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.190
So it’s really just a small body of water.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.170
So behind me you’ll see a river.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.930
A river is obviously a lot bigger than a stream
or brook.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:37.070
Once the rain has fallen, and the raindrops
have flowed through ditches and streams, eventually

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.140
all of the water ends up in the river.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.270
And rivers are really cool because people
can do recreational activities on a river.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.080
You can go fishing on a river.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.030
It’s big enough that it will have fish.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.270
You can go boating on a river.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.400
You can go canoeing on a river.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.110
So I was on my way to the lake and we’re
still going there by the way, but I was driving

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.400
by this river, this is called the Grand River,
and I remembered that there was a couple of

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.880
things I forgot to mention about rivers.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.220
One is the edge of a river is called the riverbank.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.310
And sometimes the water in a river can rise,
and the water can go over the bank and you

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.030
can have a flood.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.850
So a flood is when water goes where it’s
not supposed to go.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.170
Rivers do that quite often where the water
level will rise, especially in the spring

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.440
in Canada because everything melts.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.770
So as all the snow and ice melts the water
rises in the river and sometimes it floods,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.050
goes over the bank of the river and you have
a flood.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.460
So let’s, let’s keep going so we can get
to the lake.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:04.460
So behind me is a river and that river flows
into a lake.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.370
You can see the pier behind me and a small
lighthouse.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.970
And way in the distance all of that water
is a lake.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.600
This lake is called Lake Erie.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:26.180
I’m going to walk out to the end of the
pier, as I’m walking out if you look back,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:32.080
one of the cool things about lakes is they
often have a beach - a sandy beach.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.890
So similar to the ocean, lakes sometimes have
a beach, obviously in the middle of January

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:44.470
no one’s swimming, but there is a bit of
a sandy beach there where in the summer you

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.380
could come and wear your bathing suit and
go for a little swim.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.640
You can also see there’s a few waves coming
in, there’s a few waves rolling in so lakes

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.800
are big enough that they have waves.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.190
We’re at the end of the pier now.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:04.780
You can see the lighthouse, I’m just climbing
up a few steps here, and then I’ll give

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.720
you a, a nice view of Lake Erie.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.740
It’s, it’s big.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.520
Here we go.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:28.690
Are you ready?

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.170
So that’s a lake.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:36.639
So the biggest body of water is an ocean or
the sea, and I’m not really able to show

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:44.399
you that today because I don’t live close
to the ocean or the sea, but eventually all

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:49.569
of the water from our rivers and lakes and
streams makes its way to the ocean.

00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:53.870
I’m sure some of you live close to an ocean.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:59.070
If you do maybe mention it in the comments
below that’d be really cool to hear if some

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.420
of you live close to the Pacific Ocean or
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.420
But anyways.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.949
Bob the Canadian.

00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:07.470

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:17.730
video with a friend if you know someone who’s
learning English.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.209
I think I’m just going to stay here for
a little bit and enjoy the view.

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:23.589
It’s beautiful.

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:25.069
Sun’s coming down.

00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:27.149
It’s hitting the water really nice.

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:30.379
And it’s just a nice day out by the lake.

00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:32.920
It’s a little cold, but, it’s Canada.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.379
See you next week.
