00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.330
(gentle flowing music)

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.940
- Hello, everyone, and welcome
back to English with Lucy.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.070
Today I am going to show
you six everyday habits

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.310
for improving your English,
and these are things

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.710
that you can do at home.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.630
One of the best ways to learn a language

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.290
is to make it a part of your daily life.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.660
And you need to do this by forming habits.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.110
And I have got some great ideas for you.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.340
Some of these habits are really enjoyable.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.600
For example, the first one, which is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.930
perform guided meditation in English.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.120
So guided meditation is great

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.630
for relieving stress levels and anxiety

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.200
and making you feel more
connected with yourself,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.890
but doing it in the
language you are learning

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.060
can offer so many benefits.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.040
Often listening to English,
trying to understand English,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.200
learning English in general is really,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.430
really stressful for students.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.470
But guided meditation sessions
are designed to relax you,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.400
so you may find yourself
picking up on a lot more.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.740
I have got three recommendations

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.300
for great YouTube channels
that offer guided meditation.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.160
The first speaks with a British accent,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.530
the second with an American accent,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.510
and the third with an Australian accent.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.850
So you can choose which is best for you.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.410
For British, we have Caroline McCready.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.431
- [Caroline] Simply become
aware of your breathing.

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.181
(ethereal music)

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.060
- She has got the most
beautiful voice and accent.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.730
For the American accent, we
have The Mindful Movement.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.170
- [Woman] And now turn
off all distractions

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.420
and commit this time for yourself.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.270
- You can see there's so much
vocabulary to pick up on.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.470
And some people find that
listening to foreign languages

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.540
in a subconscious state can help them

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.420
pick up on more vocabulary.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.720
It doesn't happen for everyone,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.140
but try it and see if it works for you.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.240
And the last one, for Australian accents,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.860
we have Michael Sealey.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.900
- [Michael] And you understand that, yes,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.173
these are your thoughts,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.220
but you also know and understand

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.690
that who you are is so much more

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.513
than simply your thoughts.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.100
- Right? Let's move on
to habit number two.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.030
Habit number two is all
about keeping yourself

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.090
inspired and motivated, okay?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.940
Something that I found so
helpful and interesting

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.790
when I was actively learning Spanish

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.320
was discovering other people's
language learning journeys.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.210
And I want you to do this

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.860
with other non-native English speakers

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.400
who have reached a level of English

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.560
that you also want to reach.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.950
Every day try and watch a video

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.710
of somebody sharing their experience.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.270
You can learn so much from them.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.260
There is only so much I can teach you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.100
as a native English speaker.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.960
I'm in your shoes because
I've learned other languages,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.170
but I'm not absolutely in
your shoes with English.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.310
That's why I always say
it's great to listen

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.730
to native speakers and native teachers,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.350
but also non-native teachers
because they understand

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.510
where you're coming from because
they were once there too.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.010
So I've got an example for
you that I will link below.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.670
There is the most lovely girl.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.010
She's from Brazil, but she speaks English

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.260
with this most incredible British accent.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.490
She has absolutely nailed it.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.720
And she tells you how she's achieved that.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.400
- I am originally from Brazil

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.690
and I'm just a regular English student

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.340
like all of you out
there learning English,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.930
but I feel I would come.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.670
- If every day you can make it a habit

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.060
to listen to at least one motivating

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.420
and inspiring learning journey story,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.860
you'll pick up on so much
knowledge and insight,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.450
and you'll feel much more confident

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.400
about your own learning
process and journey.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.610
You'll realise that you're
not alone, you're not stupid.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.090
Learning English is bloody hard. (laughs)

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.980
It really, really is, and these people

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.270
who have achieved amazing
accents and wonderful fluency

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.453
should be really, really
proud of themselves.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.100
Now this next segment of the video,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.000
this next habit, has
been sponsored by Lingoda

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.460
and it is incredibly relevant.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.610
It is to take a lesson every single day.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.070
Make that habit of taking
a lesson every day.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.720
And this is so relevant,
especially in these strange times

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.600
where so many of us are having to spend

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.250
so much more time at home alone.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.900
You can take advantage of this
extra spare time right now

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.670
and take a proper English
class with a native-speaking

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.820
qualified teacher every single day.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.130
Lingoda have launched
their language sprint

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.950
where you can learn to
speak a language confidently

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.570
in just three months, gain
100% of your money back,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.570
and gain free access to the
Cambridge online speaking test.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.120
You just need to take
one of their 24/7 classes

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.100
every day for three months

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.500
and get your course fees
completely refunded.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.300
Click on the link in the description

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.110
to check the dates for this sprint,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.800
but be quick because if
you miss the deadline

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.330
or the spaces are already
filled, you will miss out.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.740
The super sprint offers a 100% refund

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.110
and there is also the lighter
option of the regular sprint,

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.740
which offers a 50% refund.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.160
You can join the sprint in
English, business English,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Spanish, French, and German
from beginner to advanced level.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.800
I'm really happy to share
this opportunity with you

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.480
because I've had first-hand experience

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.610
of how effective the Lingoda
language challenges can be.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.250
It's transformed many
of my students' lives.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.550
I've also attended many of
the English classes myself

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.250
as a student, just to make sure

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.180
they were good enough for you,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.620
and I found them to be excellent.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.350
Many of my other students just like you

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.720
love Lingoda because they can interact

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.980
with native-speaking qualified teachers

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.963
anytime, anywhere.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.680
Group sizes are really small

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.720
with an average of just
three students per class,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.440
and over 30,000 people have participated

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.960
in the previous Lingoda
language challenges.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.793
And for many of them,

00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:40.040
it has completely transformed their lives,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.300
allowing them to find new
jobs, make new friends,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.670
travel to new places, and to overcome

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.430
their fear of speaking,
which is a huge problem

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.010
for learners of any foreign language.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.390
So how can you participate?

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.690
Sign up for the sprint before the deadline

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.630
and pay the deposit to secure your spot.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.370
You can use my code CLASS1

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.850
to get 10 euros off your deposit.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.080
Lingoda will refund your
tuition fee in full,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.420
along with the deposit, if you attend

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.410
the agreed amount of
classes within each month

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.430
by following the contest rules.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.430
Remember places in the sprint are limited.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.490
This is a language school, spaces fill up.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.300
You have my link in the description box.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.283
You have my code CLASS1.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.173
What are you waiting for?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.230
Right, let's move on to habit number four.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.320
This one is work out in English.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.880
There are two ways of doing this

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.480
and I have many, many
recommendations for you.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.490
Online fitness classes are booming

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.220
because everyone is at home.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.660
They are so convenient and they are also

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.330
full of language-learning opportunities,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.210
so many verbs, so many prepositions,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.070
lots of pronunciation to learn as well.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.030
Working out is something
that you should do anyway,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.720
so why not multitask and learn
English at the same time.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.420
I have got four recommendations for you,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.320
two are British, they
speak British English,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.760
and two speak American English.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.670
My first recommendation is Joe
Wicks from The Body Coach TV.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.550
He speaks with a Cockney accent.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.270
During the lockdown, he has
been doing a daily live workout,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.270
but you can watch these
after they're live as well.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.680
- We go down like this, come up,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.010
and then we go one, two, three.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.370
- Joe's workouts are normally high energy.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.940
They're made to make you sweat.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.350
A lot of interval training,

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.460
high-intensity interval
training, HIIT training.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.850
We also have the wonderful
Lucy Wyndham-Read.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.630
She is so lovely.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.080
I've had the pleasure of
meeting her many times.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.250
She speaks with a
beautiful British accent.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.330
Her videos tend to be short

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.590
and suitable for all fitness levels.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.580
They're great if you've
just got 5, 7, 10 minutes

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.880
in the morning, or you
can stack lots together

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.000
and make a bigger workout.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.190
I love her fitness videos.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.680
- [Lucy] If you put in 100%,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.670
you get in results of 100% back.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.150
So that's where I really
want you to focus this week,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.590
on doing this for seven days.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.360
- Then we have two American channels.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.290
They're quite different.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.360
We have Blogilates.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.440
Her name is Cassey and she speaks

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.820
with a very clear American accent.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.970
- Hey guys, Cassey here

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.010
and welcome to your
seven-day glute challenge.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.450
I'm so excited to be focusing
on the lower part of our body

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.290
for this entire week.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.870
- I do a lot of Cassey's workouts myself.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.950
I love her brutal booty workout.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.160
It's quite old now, but I do it a lot.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.620
And it's really, really great
for reaching those muscles

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.300
in your bum that you can't
reach with just a normal squat.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.310
And we also have Yoga With Adriene.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.320
She teaches yoga and she has
a beautiful accent as well.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.460
It's really a pleasure to listen to her.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.480
- Hi, everyone, welcome to
home, your 30-day yoga journey.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.222
It's day 19, drum roll, please.

00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:11.750
(hands tapping)

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.510
- I have linked all four
channels down below.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.510
The other habit that I recommend

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.210
to do with working out as well

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.370
is if you like walking and running,

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.870
or you want to get into
walking and running,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.270
listen to audio books whilst doing this.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.500
Maybe you could listen to a
learning English audio book.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.510
And this actually brings
me on to number five,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.840
which is multitasking.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.350
So I'm not just focusing on working out

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.880
whilst listening to audio books.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.030
There's so much more that you can do

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.010
whilst listening to audio books,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.930
or other things, maybe radio programmes,

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.910
podcasts, anything that you
want to listen to in English,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.980
do it whilst doing something else,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.060
whilst you're Hoovering,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.690
whilst you're cooking,
whilst you're cleaning,

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.710
whilst you're working from home.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.610
There are just so many opportunities

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.770
that add an audio element
into your daily life.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.870
And if you do it every single day, ah,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.940
you'll be picking up on
so much pronunciation,

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.510
on so much vocabulary,

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.980
and so much additional knowledge as well.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.210
And now for my last habit, number six,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.300
it is participate and discuss.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.190
And I'm talking about joining forums

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.420
that are relevant to you,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.040
places where you can have
genuine written conversations

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.440
about topics that interest you.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.640
Writing a little bit every single day

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.430
is great for improving your spelling,

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.690
improving your vocabulary,

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.660
and improving your writing skills,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.580
and even better if you can have
someone correct it as well.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.450
An online forum platform that
I absolutely adore is Reddit.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.810
I spend way too much time on there.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.670
And there's so much positivity on Reddit.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.047
There are so many lovely people.

00:11:56.047 --> 00:12:00.140
Don't get me wrong, here are
some terrible things as well,

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.180
but forums like relationship
advice, ask men,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.400
ask women, legal advice,
malicious compliance,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.160
I'll link down to them,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.120
but they're all forums where
people post their problems

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.900
and other people respond.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.930
You can read and improve
your reading skills

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.950
and absorb new vocabulary,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.470
and you can also offer advice as well.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.770
You can mention, "Excuse my
English, I'm not native,"

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.317
and in brackets say, "If
anyone wants to correct me,

00:12:26.317 --> 00:12:28.770
"I'll be so happy," and you will find

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.620
that there are a lot of people on Reddit

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.660
that are willing to take the
time to help out someone else.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.010
There are so many subreddits,

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.970
these are subforums on Reddit

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.190
that cater for so many
different interests,

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:48.180
photography, art, certain
breeds of dogs, anything.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.450
If you want to find people
to share opinions with,

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.890
to ask opinions from,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.963
I think Reddit is a really good place.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.740
Right, that's it for today's lesson.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.760
I hope you enjoyed it

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.810
and I hope you are able to implement

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.790
some of these habits into your daily life,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.320
thus improving your language skills.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.720
Don't forget to check out
the Lingoda language sprint.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.170
All of the information
and the link to sign up

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.120
is in the description box.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.820
If you want to download a free audio book,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.640
the link for the 30-day
free trial on Audible

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.630
is in the description box as well.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.530
Along with all of my recommendations

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.310
for the YouTube channels
that I've mentioned, too.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.820
Don't forget to connect with
me on all of my social media.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.720
I've got my Facebook, my
Instagram, my Twitter,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.313
and I shall see you
soon for another lesson.

00:13:36.313 --> 00:13:37.227
Mwah.

00:13:37.227 --> 00:13:40.394
(gentle upbeat music)
