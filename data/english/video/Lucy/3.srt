Hello everyone, and welcome back to
English with Lucy today I am going to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.269
teach you eight ways in which you can
improve your listening skills, your

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:29.519
English listening skills. Now number one
is take advantage of YouTube's subtitle

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.280
system but make sure you understand and
use it properly so in order to improve

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.469
your daily English, the English that
you'll use every day. I want you to find

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.620
vloggers and kind of daily youtubers
that document their everyday life who

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.340
actually add their own subtitles or
vloggers that don't rely on the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.199
auto-generated subtitles. Nowadays
YouTube has some very very good subtitle

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.330
software but it's never perfect when I
post a video YouTube analyzes what I say

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.310
and it posts what it thinks I've said as
auto-generated subtitles. However, for

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.060
every single video I do pay for someone
else to actually write the subtitles and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.030
there are a couple of reasons why I do
this. Number one, I want correct spelling

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.970
and grammar YouTube software doesn't add
in the correct punctuation and kind of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.900
commas and quotation marks and things
like that and that's important for you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.710
to learn. It's important for you to see
where a sentence starts and ends and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.120
where there might be pauses. Also
sometimes the software just completely

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.310
misses out words, it misspells things, it
misunderstands what I've said. Sometimes

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.440
it puts very rude things in place of
what I've actually said so I choose to

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.470
buy my own subtitles and a lot of
creators do this and a lot of vloggers

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.490
do this and it's very very useful. Kn
fact on my own vlogging channel where

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.470
I've been documenting my life, my
personal life on the farm in rural

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.510
England, I do write the subtitles for you
so you know that what I'm saying on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.250
screen is what is also written on screen.
How can you tell if the subtitles are

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.840
trustworthy or not?
Well one indicator is the term

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.280
'auto-generated' which will come up if
YouTube's AI system has developed the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.590
software if you follow some vloggers
that speak a native level of English

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.200
watch their videos with subtitles every
week or every day you will pick up on so

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.880
much vocabulary vocabulary that we use
as natives in our daily lives

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.650
number two is listen to a variety of
accents and dialects now I don't just

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.740
say accents I say dialects because
different parts of my country England

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.350
have different dialects so northern
slang is very different to southern

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.210
slang in fact British English is so
unbelievably diverse so for example

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.250
something as simple for me as a can of
coke well up north they might say a tin

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.490
of coke when that would sound ridiculous
for me so to ensure that you understand

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.670
everything that you listen to or almost
everything that you listen to because

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.440
let's face it everything would be quite
the challenge because even I don't

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.320
understand everything that I hear you do
need to listen to a variety of accents

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.730
and dialects the different sounds that
they produce the different common

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.290
phrases that they use and the different
slang words as well are really really

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.000
important and I have something in the
pipeline that will massively help you

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.440
with this I'm going to talk about it
more towards the end of this video

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.860
number three
is of course speak with natives listen

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.540
to natives and speak to them but more
than that it's ask for repetition and

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.090
ask for explanation so you want to speak
with natives ask them to repeat things

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.520
and ask them to explain and justify
things a lot of students ask me how they

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.880
can find well priced native teachers or
native level teachers just because

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.210
someone isn't native doesn't mean that
they're not an excellent teacher and

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.800
this segment is sponsored by a come
and that I do genuinely highly recommend

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.070
and it's a talkie I talkie is a huge
online database of both native and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.720
non-native teachers who will give
one-to-one video lessons with you 24

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.800
hours a day seven days a week from
anywhere in the world as long as you

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.950
have a stable internet connection an
emphasis on well priced teachers it's

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.940
incredibly affordable it's much cheaper
than an offline Academy or an in-person

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.650
tutor the teachers set their own rates
and you can browse all of them and find

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.100
the rate that's best for you and it's
also really good if you just want to

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.700
practice conversation and listening to
someone talk and asking for them to

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.380
correct your responses because not only
do they have qualified teachers they

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.360
also have community teachers who are
there to practice conversation with you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.190
now they've given me an offer to pass on
to you you can get $10 worth of I

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.780
talking credits in your student wallet
48 hours after making your first

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.130
purchase of any amount all you've got to
do is click on the link in the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.930
description box and sign up those
credits could actually be an entire

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.790
lesson for free or more than that
actually I've seen lessons for much less

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.590
money than that also if you are at home
and you'll find yourself with a bit of

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.300
extra spare time for an extra
motivational push you can also sign up

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.940

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.530
set yourself a goal and start earning
those prizes right let's move on to way

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:38.650
number 4 now this is a really simple way
of making native speech easier to

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.289
understand
it's so simple I can't believe that

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:47.410
people still aren't taking advantage of
it do you know about YouTube's slowdown

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.060
function now when I look at videos that
are explaining something technical like

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:58.479
how to use my new washing machine or why
Mike Hoover isn't sucking sometimes I

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.009
find the person takes ages to get to the
point or to explain something so I speed

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:08.650
them up I click on the little cog and
then I click on playback speed and I put

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.990
them at one point two five times speed
or one point five if I'm feeling really

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.849
energetic
however the slowdown function would be

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:24.280
really really useful for language
learners you can slow down speech to

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.639
three-quarters of the natural pace 0.75
speed if you're watching a video and

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:35.110
you're interested in what that person is
saying but they are just speaking too

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:42.909
quickly try that 0.75 speed now 0.5
tends to be too slow the person sounds

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:50.050
drunk or deranged 0.75 for a very fast
talker can actually be really really

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.070
helpful even for me as a native speaker
there are some people that just go a

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:59.740
little more and I find it hard to follow
so if there's a vlogger or a narrator or

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.240
a presenter that you have shunned in the
past because they speak too quickly try

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.560
watching them on YouTube try slowing
them down and let me know what you think

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.020
what would be even better is if they had
their subtitles added as well so you can

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:20.349
watch them in slow speed without
subtitles and then watch them again with

00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:25.330
subtitles but more about that later on
now number five this is a really common

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.539
listening tip but I'm going to talk
about it because I've got something

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:35.560
extra to add it is watch English movies
and TV shows now we all know this this

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.459
is one of the first tips that teachers
will give you but it can be really

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:45.310
really hard and really daunting to try
and work out which TV show and which

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.839
film is going to be at your level it's
so annoying to finally find something

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:52.350
that you want to watch after reading
loads of

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.210
and then you just can't understand it
it's also really annoying when your

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:02.300
computer or your network won't allow you
to access certain films and TV shows

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.560
because of where you live because your
country is not allowed to view that

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.870
specific website I have got a video
coming next week on my recommendations

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.940
for British TV shows and I start with
beginner level and move to pre

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.370
intermediate intermediate and advanced I
cover all the bases and they're all

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.630
shows that will help you develop a
British English accent and help you

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.690
understand it as well
I'll also talk about the variety of

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.370
British English accents as well now when
this video is live I will link it in the

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.240
description box so check that out
because I want to help you find

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.560
something that you can actually watch
and understand and then you can move up

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.980
through the levels number six is learn
responses that will buy you more time

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.810
because when we are listening to what
someone is saying in a language that is

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:01.080
not our first language we do need that
little bit of extra time to process what

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.910
they're trying to say I have a couple of
tricks and phrases that will buy you

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:11.670
more time things that you can say
without seeming like a strange person

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:19.350
going because that is what a lot of
English learners do it's a natural thing

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:25.040
to want to fill the gap by just making
one noise like

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.120
and you also don't want to just fill it
with silence because that can be awkward

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.990
that person might think that you've not
heard them when really you've just not

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:40.130
understood them what you want to do is
fill the conversation with fillers or

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.790
interjections and I've made various
videos on this topic I did a great one

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:50.370
with Harry from real English with real
teachers on interjections things like

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.610
ooh

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.910
I will link that down below and also
last week I did post a video on

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.100
different ways to say I know and I
understand because those are very

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.970
commonly used in conversation whilst
you're processing what someone has said

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.480
or you're just showing that you've
understood and acknowledged what they've

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.590
said again I will link that I think both
of those videos would be really really

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.390
useful they will give you phrases that
you can use to buy more time whilst

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:26.310
you're processing speech number seven is
listen whilst you read listen whilst you

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.060
read now I talked about this a lot in my
videos because it really really works

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:36.060
I'm always talking about listening to
audiobooks as you read the actual book

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.620
and I'm not just saying this for fun
this is genuinely such a good method it

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:46.920
trains your brain to connect written
words with spoken words it helps improve

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.790
your pronunciation it helps improve your
listening it helps improve your spelling

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.710
as well the way a word is spelt in
English doesn't necessarily give you any

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.180
indication as to how it's pronounced in
English and the way a word is pronounced

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.650
in English doesn't really help you work
out how that word is spelt this is why

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.760
English seems like such a hard language
to understand when you're listening to

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.590
it and such a hard language to pronounce
because you look at word and you just

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.430
have no idea how it should be pronounced
if you take a book that you have already

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.180
read in English or a book that you would
like to read in English and read that

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:26.340
book as you are listening to that same
audiobook version your problems will be

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.780
solved now it's important to find a
narrator you like and this is why I

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:36.160
always recommend audible audible is an
amazing platform of audiobooks they have

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.319
the most incredible selection and you
can also listen to quite lengthy samples

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:46.360
so you can work out if you like the
narrator's accent if you like the speed

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.860
at which they speak you can also slow
them down and you can speed them up if

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.910
you feel like you need to and the best
part is you can get one free audio book

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.439
that's a 30-day free trial or an audible
and you just have to click on the link

00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:03.430
in the description box to sign up and
there I've put some recommendations for

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.740
great books as well audiobooks to listen
to and they're written book counterparts

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:13.029
it's a great method that's why I talk
about it all the time now the last tip

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:19.180
number 8 is to create your own
transcription exercises you know those

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.290
annoying horrible listening tests where
you have to fill in a gap right what you

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.430
hear
unfortunately they work however we want

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.870
to do something that's relevant for us
don't we so if you find something that

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.939
is particularly interesting to you have
you are interested in photography and

00:13:36.939 --> 00:13:42.250
it's about cameras maybe you're
interested in wildlife or skateboarding

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.540
I have no idea but everybody has their
thing don't they I personally love

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.139
cooking and gardening well if you find
something that's very very interesting

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:55.720
to you create your own listing exercise
because it won't be so boring and

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.180
painful this exercise is all about
listening blindly meaning that you are

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.019
not looking at any visuals so you don't
see their mouth moving you don't see

00:14:05.019 --> 00:14:10.870
their emotion nothing and you definitely
definitely don't look at any subtitles

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:15.009
take one sentence or if you're feeling
more advanced you can take a couple of

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:21.550
sentences and listen to it once then you
can listen to it for a second time and

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:27.009
then you have to write down exactly what
