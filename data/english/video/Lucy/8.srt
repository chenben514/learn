00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.590
Hello everyone.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.840
And welcome back to English With Lucy.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.000
Today, I am going to teach you how you can
improve your spoken English at home on your

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.330
own.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.980
Whenever you look online to find out top tips
for improving your spoken English, the number

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.950
one tip is always talk to native speakers,
talk to speakers of English, practise conversation.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.730
And that just isn't a realistic possibility
for all of us.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.080
I know that so many of you will find yourselves
in situations where conversing with native

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.820
speakers or speakers of English in general
just isn't an option.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.060
It's not widely available.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.380
Sometimes it's to do with money.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.050
You don't have the finances available to do
that.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.020
It could be a confidence thing where actually
you don't feel ready to speak to people yet.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.360
You want to practise a little bit on your
own first.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.600
It could just be that you don't know where
to start.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.060
So I've got lots of tips in today's video,
and I hope to help each and every one of you.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.530
As always, I have created a free PDF for you
that goes along with this lesson, it contains

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.640
the full transcript, everything I say, and
I have highlighted key vocabulary.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.090
So you can use that to improve your understanding
even further.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.220
If you'd like to download the PDF, all you've
got to do is click on the link in the description

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.710
box and your name and your email address.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.860
You sign up to my mailing list.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.650
This is completely free.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.370
I will send the PDF directly to your inbox.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.490
And then every week after you will automatically
receive all lesson PDFs, plus all my news,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.900
offers and updates.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900
Right.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.610
Let's start with tip number one.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.260
This tip is learn full phrases, not just individual
vocabulary words.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.420
Now there is a place for studying individual
vocabulary words.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.909
That helped me a lot with my own learning
journey when I was learning Spanish.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.940
But if you are particularly focused on improving
your spoken English, then try learning entire

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.340
phrases.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.970
When we say a word on its own, we say it in
a very flat way.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.849
Amazed, amazed.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.400
When I say that word as part of a sentence,
I was amazed.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.750
I had a different tone, some inflexion, some
emphasis, more stress.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.220
Listen to speakers of English.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.140
When you're watching the TV or watching a
YouTube video or listening to the radio, whatever

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.500
you're doing to try and immerse yourself in
English, try and pick up on those individual

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.190
phrases and work out where in the phrase they're
pushing the pitch up, or they're saying it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.080
slightly more loudly.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.741
Pause it if you can imitate it, it's going
to help you sound really natural when you

00:02:57.741 --> 00:02:59.230
speak English.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.280
Another part of this is if you do pick up
on an individual vocabulary word that you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.290
want to remember, make sure you also include
an example of it used in a sentence as well.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.790
That's why with the majority of my vocabulary
videos, I always include an example.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.629
If you write it down, make little notes and
dashes to try and remember how the speaker

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.690
said that sentence or phrase.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.030
Tip number two.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.930
This tip actually comes as thanks to the sponsor
of today's video: Busuu.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.640
Now in general, my students mention two key
problems when it comes to improving their

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.270
spoken English on their own at home.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.350
Motivation and access to feedback.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.230
And that last one especially.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.150
It all links in to not having the opportunity
that I mentioned at the beginning.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.000
That's where Busuu comes in because they have
a solution to both of these problems.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.830
If you haven't heard of Busuu before, it's
a global language learning community and it's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.989
available on both mobile and desktop.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.330
And I know that's very important to many of
you.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.020
They have loads of language courses that you
can take to improve your spoken English and

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.700
your reading and listening, and writing, and
many other languages like Spanish and Japanese.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.000
Here's the best bit.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.209
On the Busuu platform, you can connect with
speakers of the language that you're learning

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.750
and receive feedback.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.860
It's like gold dust.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.330
Feedback is one of the most valuable tools
when it comes to learning a language.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.029
But it's so hard to find.

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.139
Why is it always that way?

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.319
It's especially hard to find if you're learning
a popular language like English, there are

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.869
so many people across the world who would
love to receive feedback, but there's a shortage

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:45.689
of people willing to give that feedback.

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.860
Busuu also has this amazing study plan tool,
which you can use to keep you motivated.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.900
I love this.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.830
I love having everything planned out and organised.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.210
It really does keep me on track.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.689
I do it with planning my videos, planning
my work life and with planning language learning

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:01.689
as well.

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.020
The study plan tool breaks the language down.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.150
It reminds you what to study and when, and
this allows you to set realistic goals, which

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.860
are so important.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.529
To sign up to Busuu and explore what they
have to offer, just click on the link in the

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:16.839
description box.

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:22.270
You can sign up for free, or you can choose
to get a premium membership, which has lots

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.770
of additional features.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.779
They are offering my students an extra 30%
off all memberships.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.430
Just use code Lucy 30.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.570
Right.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.570
Tip number three.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.169
Let's go back to analysing and listening to
what speakers of English say and how they

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.169
say it.

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.979
But I'm not talking about pronunciation and
tone of voice this time.

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.430
This time, I want to look at what they say
grammatically.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.099
I know that grammar and spoken English don't
tend to go hand in hand, but I think it's

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.240
important here.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.499
Now, let me make this clear.

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:59.699
I do not think that learning grammar is the
most important part of learning a language

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:00.699
at all.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.690
Now you would never teach a baby grammar ye.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.059
They grow up to be fluent in a language.

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:07.500
But you need to bear in mind.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.749
A baby is immersed the entire time.

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.599
Lots of people say, learn English like a baby.

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:20.249
But what they don't bear in mind is that babies
are immersed in English or their mother tongue

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:22.159
the entire time.

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.219
They have the most wonderful opportunity to
pick up on all the spoken English and all

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.009
the grammar and all the vocabulary without
even realising it.

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.759
Bless them.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.529
Even then it takes them a couple of years
to speak fluently.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.369
Yes, of course their brains are still developing.

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:42.999
But the point I want to make is there is a
place for grammar, but it's not the be-all

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.999
and end-all.

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:48.249
I really don't see the value in going through
a grammar book cover to cover.

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:50.199
I really don't see the value in that.

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.050
And it's something that I have never done
in my own language learning journey.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.710
What I did do was essentially fill in the
gaps.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.349
I was constantly on the lookout for holes
or gaps in my grammar knowledge.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:08.129
I think you should go through time filling
those gaps bit by bit, rather than approaching

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.580
grammar as this big textbook that you have
to work through.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.719
It goes back to looking at full phrases again,
look at those phrases.

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.559
Is there something that you can't explain
or that doesn't sound right to you in your

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:21.559
head?

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:23.619
That should be the topic that you research.

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:27.189
That should be the topic that you bring to
the table with your conversation partner or

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:30.249
your English teacher, or you search on an
online forum.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:35.559
There are some amazing language forums with
some really, really enthusiastic teachers

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:37.740
who seem to give up their time for free.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.120
I can't believe the quality of answers that
I get from language forums.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.719
I doubt grammar all the time.

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:44.460
I'm constantly looking it up.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.740
This brings me on to tip number four, which
is don't let anything go.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.819
Don't drop anything.

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:52.379
I know the feeling.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:57.580
You hear a word or a phrase that you don't
understand and you think, ugh, I can't be

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.580
bothered.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.189
I'll remember it.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:01.969
I'll remember it and do it later.

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:03.090
You won't.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.680
9 times out of 10, you will not remember it.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.860
It's like when you come up with a really good
tune in your head and you think, oh, I'll

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.869
remember that tomorrow.

00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:14.629
How could I ever forget something like this?

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.199
And then you just can't the next day.

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:17.199
It's gone.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.149
It's lost potentially forever.

00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:22.580
Every time you have a doubt, don't let it
escape you.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.520
Just don't let it escape.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.240
Write it down immediately.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.189
If you can't write it down because you don't
know how it's spelled use the recording voice

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:32.260
notes function on your phone.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.840
If it's not possible for you to see a teacher
every single week, save up all of these doubts

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.250
and book in one hour a month and see how many
of those doubts you can clear up with them

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.419
in that session.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:51.129
But please look into my eyes and tell me,
Lucy, I will not let my next doubt go.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:55.279
But don't stress yourself out at the same
time.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.310
Obviously you have to take everything with
a pinch of salt.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.970
You've got to make it work for you.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:04.700
But I find if I come up with a fantastic video
idea and I don't write it down immediately,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.810
that video will never be made.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.170
And it's the same with your grammar and vocabulary
doubts.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.100
Let's move on to number five.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.690
The previous tips were more about theory.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.620
Now I'm going to talk about putting it into
practise.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.560
When I was learning Spanish, living in Spain
and conversing with lots of Spaniards, there

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.980
was one topic that at first caused me a lot
of anxiety.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:30.829
And then over time it caused me a lot of joy
and excitement, and I just loved it.

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:36.310
And that is telling anecdotes and telling
stories, especially funny ones.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:42.060
I really think there is no better feeling
than making someone laugh in the language

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.160
that you're learning, it's such a good feeling.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.889
There are very few people in this world that
can just launch into a story and have everyone

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:53.529
engaged and interested.

00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:55.800
Some people are blessed with this skill.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.040
I am not one of them.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.110
If I want to tell a good story, I have to
prepare it in advance and have it up my sleeve,

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.360
have it ready.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.500
I have to do this in English, let alone in
another language.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.899
If you want to feel funny, interesting, and
engaging, I really urge you to practise and

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:21.870
sort of perfect, but I'll talk about that
more, your anecdotes and your personal stories,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.029
things that you are going to want to tell
to lots of different people.

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:30.140
I have maybe five or six entertaining stories
that I have ready in case there's a gap in

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.140
conversation.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.560
And if I meet someone new.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:40.329
My poor friends and my poor, poor fiance have
probably heard these stories 20 times each.

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:46.689
I encourage you to write your stories down,
to try and do as best a job you can of correcting

00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:52.639
the grammar, of making sure it flows and then
potentially bringing it to a speaker of English

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.329
to correct for you.

00:10:54.329 --> 00:10:56.240
Stories don't have to be perfect when you
tell them.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.110
In fact, it looks weird and sounds weird when
you read it out like a robot.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:07.230
On your own at home, practise the story, read
it aloud a couple of times, then have a go

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.329
reading it with no prompts.

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:13.670
If you have this preparation, you'll feel
so much better when you finally talk to another

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.959
speaker of English.

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:18.690
Great topics you could use are funny mistakes
that you've made in English.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:24.420
I know that I always love hearing my students
laugh about the mistakes they've made.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.139
It shows that you're a really chilled and
funny person.

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:30.089
And it's entertaining for me to hear.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:35.029
In the UK, we love self-deprecating humour,
which shows that you can laugh at yourself.

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:37.660
You could almost mock yourself, put yourself
down.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.660
We love that.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.699
We also love irony.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.470
I've actually created an entire video on British
humour.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.080
I'll put it in the description box.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.209
It's called British humour explained with
examples, which sounds like the least fun

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:54.209
video ever, but I think it might be able to
help you.

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.980
So I hope that's clear.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.649
Practise your anecdotes, practise your stories.

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:02.990
And even if your goal is to not be funny,
practise, the things that you know you will

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.120
have to repeat again and again and again.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.410
How did you end up in your job?

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.430
What were your school days?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.430
Like?

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.529
How did you meet your partner?

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:14.930
Practise those stories so that they just roll
off the tongue.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:20.209
It might seem like cheating, but if it is
then I'm a cheat because that's what I do.

00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:24.930
Number six is listen to chatty podcasts.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:32.470
There has been a podcast revolution all across
the world, especially in the UK.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.779
We absolutely love podcasts.

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:40.060
And there are a lot of people who aren't necessarily
famous already starting podcasts with their

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.589
friends and they just chat.

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:47.040
This is the perfect spoken English improvement
opportunity.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.210
Finally, you get to eavesdrop, you get to
listen in on other people's conversations.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.290
This is something that I absolutely love.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:00.230
You might not have the opportunity to be in
a conversation with lots of English speakers.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:05.130
Even if you did, it might be too nuanced or
fast paced for you to understand and participate

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.130
in.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.980
Well, loads of lovely people have recorded
their chatty conversations and you can pause

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.980
them.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.460
You can check their transcripts if they have
one.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.839
People who add transcripts to podcasts, they
are the best.

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:21.509
These chatty podcasts really fill a void.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.860
Even for me, I don't have a big group of female
friends.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:31.740
So I feel that I miss out sometimes on the
gossip and talking about girls stuff, but

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.850
I've got a couple of podcasts that I listen
to and they fill that gap for me.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.930
As sad as that might sound, I hope you can
relate with that when it comes to learning,

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.819
spoken English and practising your conversation.

00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:46.069
Stop them, start them, slow them down, replay
them.

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:50.990
You can do whatever you want with them, but
they are a fantastic learning tool for you.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.350
There are so many with so many different niches.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:59.870
One really good place to start is to look
at the UK charts for podcasts, especially

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.870
for episodes.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.730
That gives a really good vibe on what's good
and what's not.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:09.620
If you're interested in football, the Peter
Crouch Podcast is meant to be absolutely fantastic,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.760
wide variety of accents.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.630
There are lots of comedy podcasts, like No
Such Thing As A Fish.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.660
There are quite a few with rude names that
I don't want to put on my channel.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.660
Do you know what?

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.759
I'm going to list them in the description
box.

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:27.769
If you have any other chatty podcast recommendations,
please do put them in the comment section.

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:33.879
We can all learn from each other and hopefully
you can recommend me a good way to procrastinate.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:41.740
Number seven, make sure you always have good
topics to talk about.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.260
When we talk to people, we often talk about
current affairs.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.519
A lot of the current affairs are very depressing
and most people don't want to talk about how

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:53.110
terrible the year has been.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.160
So I have some solutions for you.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:03.460
I was feeling really down last year from about
June onwards, and I actually got to the point

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.939
of despair where I thought the world was just
an awful place.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:11.839
And one of my friends sent me a newspaper
and it's called The Happy Newspaper.

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:17.850
This wonderful girl called Emily Coxhead writes
it, and this opened my eyes to the world of

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.850
positive news.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:25.000
I absolutely love these and they are the most
amazing tools for creating really good positive

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
conversation.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.449
Newspapers have always been teachers' favourite
tools for learning English and for creating

00:15:31.449 --> 00:15:33.699
dialogue, inciting conversation.

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:40.829
And what better than to have a newspaper that
is just full of the best stories of the quarter.

00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:43.940
I now have two happy news subscriptions.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.230
One is called Positive News.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.480
One is called Happy News.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.189
They're both written in different ways, so
there's not too much overlap.

00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:54.720
They both come out every three months and
I like to get a physical copy.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.559
Although there are websites as well, which
I will leave in the description box.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.550
They're very inexpensive.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.949
I highly recommend them for a fantastic mood
boost, something you can pick up and then

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:07.459
use to talk about with people.

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:11.300
I've checked for you and they do both offer
worldwide delivery.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.589
I think the most wonderful English speaking
club idea would be the happy new speaking

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:18.600
club or something like that.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.759
If you could get a group of people to meet
on Zoom every quarter and discuss your favourite

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:28.290
stories from these newspapers, I would want
to join them.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.379
Whenever I create a video about English speaking,
I look at my comment section and there are

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:36.990
just so many people who are desperate to practise
with other people.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:42.910
If you want to join a conversation club and
you can't find one, create one, just create

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.959
one, take something like Positive News or
Happy News as a prompt.

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.509
It's not hard to run and it would be so much
fun.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:53.290
My last point is number eight and it is chill
out.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.310
No it's don't stress.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.380
And in particular don't stress about your
accent.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.350
Accents can unfortunately be such a massive
source of shame.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.959
So when you're looking to improve your pronunciation,
I want you to do exactly that.

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:08.600
Look at improving your pronunciation.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.900
Please just don't stress yourself out with
trying to reduce or get rid of your accent.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.529
Unless it's something you really want to do,
there's just no point.

00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:22.360
I understand the charm of it when I was learning
Spanish and you've got to understand I was

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360
in a fantastic position.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.500
I was going out with a Spanish guy living
with a Spanish family.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.820
I really had all the opportunities there for
me.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.080
And it was so amazing when I was mistaken
for a native speaker from time to time.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.640
So I do understand the charm and there are
loads of options for people who do want to

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.210
achieve that, but just try and analyse why
you're doing that.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:45.279
But in general, the most important thing is
improving your pronunciation to speak in an

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:47.580
understandable and clear way.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.490
You want to speak so that other people can
understand you easily.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.280
If learning about other accidents and mimicking
other accidents is something that you really

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.740
enjoy, and it brings you a lot of pleasure
then by all means do that.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.539
But if it's stressing you out or making you
feel bad about yourself, don't do that.

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:04.760
It's a really, really hard thing to do.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.690
An example of how unimportant accents are
nowadays is my experience with Google.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.630
I spent a lot of time with people who work
at Google and YouTube.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:18.480
I visited lots of Google offices in different
locations, such a high percentage of the people

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:25.140
who work in this massive, amazing company
with fantastic salaries have very strong,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.169
very clearly non-native accents.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:29.720
And has it affected them?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.720
No.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.160
Does it affect what I think of them?

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.160
Yes.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.690
It makes me really impressed that they speak
another language to such a high standard every

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.770
day in their workplace.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.770
Wow.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.770
I don't know.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.770
That's food for thought.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.320
I'm sure each of you will have your own individual
opinion on what's important and what's right

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320
for you.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.461
I just wanted to put it out there because
I have seen some comments that have made me

00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:56.790
sad about people trying to lose a bit of their
identity.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.370
And that's what an accent is, it's a part
of your identity.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.370
Right.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.419
I think that brings us to the end of this
video.

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:04.070
I really hope you enjoyed it.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.790
And I hope you learned something.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.520

You can also download the PDF of this lesson.

00:19:16.659 --> 00:19:20.580
It's got the full transcript, plus some key
vocabulary.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.860
If you'd like to improve your listening skills
and expand your vocabulary even further, I

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:30.899
highly recommend my vlogging channel, where
I vlog our lives here on a farm in the English

00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:31.899
countryside.

00:19:31.899 --> 00:19:36.750
Every single vlog is fully subtitled so it's
specifically designed with English learners

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.750
in mind.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.190
Don't forget to connect with me on all of
my social media.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:47.360
I've got my Instagram and my website, englishwithlucy.co.uk,
where I have a fantastic pronunciation tool

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.400
where you can click on all the different phonemes
and you could hear me pronounce them.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.420
I love it, even though I made it myself.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.220
E. No.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.660
I will see you soon for another lesson.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.010
I feel like my voice is lower today.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.010
Problems.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.450
Give the feedback.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.990
Did I say that right?

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.640
But please look into my eyes and tell me,
Lucy ... Sorry.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:20.640
Please look into my eyes right now and tell
me ... Will, do you have the battery?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.820
Okay.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.020
Thank you very much.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.549
Oh, that's perfect.

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:26.549
Amazing.

00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:27.549
Okay.

00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:33.480
Even if you did, it would probably be ... You
can actually ... Peter Crouch.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480
Peter Crouch.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.620
Is his name Peter Crouch?

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.140
Peter Crouch.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.140
Yeah.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.149
Have very strong, very ... Have very strong
... Have very strong.

00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:47.180
There has been a podcast revelation.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.240
Revelation?

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.300
Revolution.
