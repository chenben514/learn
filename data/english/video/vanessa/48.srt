Hi.

00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:05.180
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.599
How can you learn English with music?

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.219
Let's talk about it.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.380
Before we talk about this topic, let's see
can we learn English with music?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.050
Is it possible?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.830
I often get emails from people asking me is
this a good way to learn English?

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.730
Is it normal, a daily conversation, common
vocabulary?

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.160
I want to answer this question first.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Can you learn English with music?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.480
And the answer is a big yes.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.870
Yes, you can definitely learn English with
music, but you might not be learning daily

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.530
conversational English.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.360
You'll certainly be learning English, but
it might not be the kind of English that we

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.190
often use in conversation, because songs are
poetry.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.820
They use words to fit the rhythm of the song.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.490
They use words to fit a certain style of music,
so the words aren't exactly like daily conversation,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.700
but you're going to learn a lot, and there's
something in our human brains that links music

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.220
and this tune and melody with memory.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.259
It's a great way to remember things.

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.500
So certainly, you can learn English with music,
but how can you do it?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.670
What's a good method?

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.569
Well, the first step is to find music in English
that you like.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.350
There probably are already a couple bands
or a couple popular songs that you like, so

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.899
I recommend listening to them a lot.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.060
For me, when I want to learn the words of
a French song, I usually listen to it a couple

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.619
times and then I go online and I try to find
the lyrics of the song.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.990
The lyrics are the words of the song.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.230
And because I've already heard the song a
couple times, I read the lyrics.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.830
Sometimes, if I really love the song, I'll
print the lyrics and try to sing the lyrics

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.470
with the song.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.750
Who cares if you have a terrible singing voice?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.640
Maybe you have an amazing singing voice.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.860
The purpose is to train your speaking as well
as your listening skills.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.030
So when you use the lyrics, it's kind of like
subtitles, or like a transcript.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.750
You can really hear each word.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.120
And after you practice with the lyrics a couple
times, you can probably sing the song without

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120
them.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.230
And then when you're driving, or taking a
walk, or singing in the shower, you can really

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.480
use English like a native speaker because
you have memorized those same sentences, the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.570
same lines that a native speaker is using.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.090
If you want to learn something that's specifically
conversational English but you don't want

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.680
to go back to elementary school and practice
really basic songs about the weather, or about

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.980
colors, well, a good way to do that is to
use musical theater.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.700
If you have ever seen Phantom of the Opera,
or Les Miserables, or this kind of sound of

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:43.500
music, a style of singing and talking at the
same time, they often have conversations while

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.650
they're singing.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.540
And maybe the style of music is not your favorite
style of music, but if you want to learn conversational

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.520
English with a tune, this is a good way to
do it.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.900
If you've never used musical theater before
to learn English, or if that's just not your

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.670
style, I want to give you one song recommendation
just to introduce you to this kind of fun,

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.930
conversational way to use music.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.590
This song is called My New Philosophy, and
it's from the musical You're a Good Man Charlie

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.660
Brown.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.840
Maybe you know Charlie Brown, or Snoopy, he's
a famous comic character, cartoon character,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.449
and there is a musical, a whole play, a theater
based on those characters.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:43.169
In this song, two characters have a conversation
while they're singing, so in your mind you're

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.740
using that musical memory plus conversation
together.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.219
And even though this isn't the only way to
learn conversation with music, it's just one

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.219
recommendation.

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:00.439
I will post the link to this video in the
description below this so that you can check

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.099
it out and see if you can catch each word.

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.039
If you enjoy it, try to read the lyrics.

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.460
Try to sing along and imitate that fun, crazy
conversation that they're having.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.349
And now I have a question for you.

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.249
What kind of music do you like in English?

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.389
Give us some recommendations.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.550
If you have a link to another YouTube video
that's from this band, or from your favorite

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.069
song, let us know.

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.610
Let's share together and learn with each other's
musical interests.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.090
Thanks so much for learning with me, and I'll
see you the next time.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.389
