Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.100
Do you want to use movies to learn English?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.700
Let's talk about it.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.980
Do you like watching movies?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.280
Personally, I don't watch too many movies,
but I really enjoy a good movie.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.339
Today I'm going to share with you my top three
movies plus two bonus movies for learning

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.990
more about American culture, and these aren't
just my choices.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.970
The National Film Registry has chosen these
movies along with several others that they

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.630
say are important for learning about American
culture.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.280
They are culturally, historically, and aesthetically
significant films, so let's get started with

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.340
my first recommendation.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.800
My first recommendation features to quite
famous actors.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.180
They are Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio
and this movie is What's Eating Gilbert Grape.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.410
This movie was filmed in the '90s, so they
are young.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.300
In fact, they're almost kids, they're teenagers.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.140
In this movie, Johnny Depp is the older brother
and he needs to take care of his younger brother,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.800
Leonardo DiCaprio who has a mental disability
and the older brother needs to take care of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.380
his younger brother because their mother is
incapable of doing it.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.120
She is 500 pounds or 260 kilograms.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.570
In this movie, we can see an interesting dynamic
between the mother and her sons, and also

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.710
this is something I think is quite valuable
for learning about American culture, their

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.980
family, and the small town in Iowa where they
live.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.710
This is in the middle of the US.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.909
This is real small town America.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.490
When I watched this movie, I thought this
really accurately portrays small town America.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.590
You can see some dialogues between characters
that's quite realistic and even though this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.421
movie is not action packed, there's not explosions
and crazy things that are happening, it's

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:04.330
realistic and I think that it's a great way
to learn more about culture and improve your

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.760
listening skills.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.649
My second movie recommendation is a classic.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.680
It features Tom Hanks and it's Forrest Gump.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.890
I hope that you've at least heard of this
movie and if you haven't, make sure that you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.890
watch it.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.079
It features a slow witted, which means not
so smart man, Forrest Gump, who's played by

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:31.180
Tom Hanks and he lives through some really
valuable times in American history.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.599
This takes place between the 1940s and the
1980s, and a lot of things happened during

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.200
this time and the lead character plays some
important roles in American history.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.790
Even though he's a fictional character, you
can see him in different places in American

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.359
history that are quite pivotal.

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.189
Some of the things that he experiences and
even influences are American football matches,

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.950
meeting President Kennedy, going to war in
Vietnam, playing ping pong in China, investing

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.980
in Apple computers.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.349
These are quite important things that happened
in the last century, so here you're going

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.659
to be able to understand a lot of history,
but as well learn more about a movie that

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.739
is culturally significant.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.290
It's quoted a lot, it's talked a lot about
in daily conversation, so you'll be building

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.659
your knowledge so that you can have great
conversations.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.279
My third movie recommendation is the reason
why I'm wearing this shirt that has little

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.719
bicycles on it.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:37.849
It is the classic movie E.T. or extra terrestrial
and you might know that this movie is about

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.239
an alien who is found by a 10-year-old boy
and this movie is excellent for testing your

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.819
listening skills because the main character
is a 10-year-old.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.900
The dialogue is pretty simple, not too fast,
and you can see it through his perspective.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.599
This is a great way to start watching movies
in English without feeling too overwhelmed.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.069
This movie E.T. also plays an important role
in American culture because often when someone

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.969
points or especially if they point to the
sky, we might say ET phone home, which is

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.689
the classic line from this movie.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.440
In fact, I found myself doing this yesterday
with my baby.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.310
Even though he's not really speaking much
yet, he's still quite young, he is starting

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.180
to learn about American culture through daily
conversation.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.940
He likes to point a lot.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.190
When he was pointing to the sky, I said, "Are
you trying to phone home?"

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.800
Here he's going to be building his knowledge
of the culture through these type of interactions.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.990
You can do this as well, watch the movie and
try to learn more about the culture and included

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.759
when you speak with other people.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.840
Now I have two bonus movies for you.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.970
These ones are a little bit more intense.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.190
I would say they're probably not good for
kids, depending on your kids, but I personally

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.939
wouldn't show them to my children.

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:07.710
The first one is Shawshank Redemption.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.729
The reason why I'm including this movie is
because it is definitely culturally significant

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.729
in the US.

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.340
We reference this movie.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.490
There are scenes where we imitate this movie
quite often, and this is about the American

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.490
prison system.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.439
There is a man named Andy who is convicted
of two murders and he sent to prison.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:33.730
In prison, he meets Red who is Morgan Freeman,
a famous American actor, and they formed a

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.730
friendship.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.979
This movie is about learning more about American
culture.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.789
It's about learning about the prison system,
about friendship, and ultimately about hope.

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:44.789
What is hope?

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.550
Can we have hope in desperate situations?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.759
This movie is based on a book by Stephen King
and Stephen King is pretty famous for suspenseful

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.729
intense stories.

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.680
As you can imagine, this book in this movie
is pretty intense.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.849
I wouldn't recommend it for children, but
if you enjoy suspense, intense filled movies,

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.349
not horror, not thrillers, but just intense.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.410
I really recommend this one.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.120
My second bonus movie is one of my personal
favorites, it's the Rear Window and this movie

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.120
is quite old.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.990
It's from the 1950s, but it's filmed by a
famous film director Alfred Hitchcock.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.139
In my personal opinion, you haven't lived
until you've seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.460
They're simple and suspenseful and delightful.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.479
I love them.

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:40.910
Well, this one is unusual because it takes
place in only one room.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.770
You never leave this one room.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.770
Why?

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.479
Well, the main character who is played by
Jimmy Stewart and his counterpart, Grace Kelly,

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.080
who became the princess of Monaco after filming
this.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.530
Anyway, the main character, Jimmy Stewart,
he has broken his leg so he's stuck in his

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.530
room.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.919
He can't get out and he's a well-known photographer
and journalist, so he's always curious.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.110
While he's stuck in his room, he's watching
the neighbors.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.050
You can see out his apartment window and you
can see what he's seen out his window.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:21.099
I think this movie is pretty culturally significant
because we often think about this old style

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:26.969
movie when we think about classic films and
this one is one of the best in my opinion.

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:31.729
When you watched this movie, I hope that you'll
appreciate the beauty of the cinematography

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:35.539
and how creative they were with just this
one room.

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:36.539
Go ahead and watch it.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:42.270
It's not a horror movie, it's not a thriller,
but it is intense and it is a mystery, so

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.610
go ahead and enjoy it.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.580
Now I have a question for you.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.020
In the comments below this video, let me know
what is one of your favorite movies.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.520

and relax, turn on Netflix or Hulu or Amazon

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.860
Prime or wherever you watch your movies, and
take one of these recommendations and try

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.620

English subtitles.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.169
Go ahead, you can do it.
