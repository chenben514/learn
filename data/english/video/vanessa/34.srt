Hi I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.610
Which English skill is the most important?

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.259
Let's talk about it.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.010
Which is the most important English skill?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.560
Speaking, listening, pronunciation, reading,
writing?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.550
Well, I'm not gonna make you wait until the
end of this lesson to tell you, I'm not gonna

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.890
make you wait five minutes.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.289
I'm gonna tell you right now that speaking
is the most important English skill, in my

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.289
opinion.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.320
Why is speaking the most important?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.260
But Vanessa, what about writing business emails?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.149
I need to write professional emails.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819
Okay, okay, I understand.

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:47.819
In specific situations, you need to write
well, but can learn with a few quick tips

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.129
how to write a decent business email.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.620
You can watch my lesson about how to improve
your writing skills, here.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.909
So why is speaking the most important English
skill?

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.499
Let's take a look at the top three situations
where your most likely to use English.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.750
Number one, traveling to another country.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.680
If you go to New York City or even to Berlin
in Germany, you're going to need to communicate

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.490
with the hotel staff, the airport crew, your
tour guide.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.450
You're not going to write down, excuse me,
my flight was delayed, can you help me book

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.450
another flight?

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.510
No, no, no, you're not gonna write it down,
you're gonna say it.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.760
You need to speak with those people.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.250
If you don't know what to say in those situations,
you can watch my travel playlist up here for

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.590
some essential travel expressions.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.940
Number two is, you go on a business meeting
internationally or maybe you have an American

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.180
client or representative from the American
branch come to visit you in your country.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.640
In this situation, it's even more important
to speak English, because yes you'll have

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.930
some business meetings, you'll have some business
conversations, but you'll probably also take

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.090
the clients or take the representatives to
dinner.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.230
In these casual situations you're gonna need
to speak the whole time together, so speaking

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.400
is essential.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.520
Number three, you want to make friends around
the world and really who doesn't want to make

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.500
friends around the world.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.200
This is truly how we can have more peace in
the world.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.230
I know it seems idealistic and like a fantasy,
but really when we see other people and talk

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.620
with other people from other cultures, we
can connect more directly and we can more

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.270
directly see what other people are like and
we often learn that people are people everywhere.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.870
Now that I've explained why speaking is the
most important English skill, I'd like to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.270
tell you that the second most important skill
in English is listening.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.300
Why?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.540
Well, conversations are two way.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.470
You speak, they listen.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.930
They speak, you listen.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.550
You have to understand the other person in
order to have a conversation.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.560
But how can you understand fast, natural English
conversations?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.230
Well, I have some good news.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.880
You can click on the video up here or in the
description and this lesson will help you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.880
a lot.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.670
It will increase your listening skills and
you'll be on the path to understanding native

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.760
speakers so that you can speak and have a
conversation.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.640
We've talked about speaking and listening
and writing, but what about pronunciation?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.830
Well of course you want other people to understand
you, you want your accent to be good enough,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.630
so that other people can understand you, but
how can you improve your accent?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.050
Well, you have to speak.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.600
You have to practice speaking.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.890
So everything goes back to speaking.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.530
Speaking is that key point to help you improve
your pronunciation, improve your listening

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.709
skills, improve your vocabulary and everything.

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.030
What about reading?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.200
When you're reading, it's a great way to increase
your vocabulary and feel more comfortable

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.340
with natural sentence structure, but with
reading you can take your time.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.830
If you're reading a medical article for your
studies or you're reading a business email,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.310
or maybe you're reading one of the books that
I recommended in last week's video, you can

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.840
take your time and review and go over the
vocabulary.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.720
With speaking, someone else is standing right
there, waiting for you to create a sentence,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.650
so it's more urgent to improve your speaking.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.160
I hope that I've convinced you that speaking
and listening are the most important skills

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
in English.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160
So now you might have a question.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.750
Vanessa, how do I get started?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.790
I believe that speaking is the most important
skill, so what do I do now?

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.750
Well I have some good news.
