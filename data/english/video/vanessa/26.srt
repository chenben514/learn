00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.310
Vanessa: Hi!

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.830
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.440
Let's have a real English conversation.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.980
Today I have something super special to share
with you.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.910
I'm going to share with you a real conversation
that I had with a local yoga instructor here

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.910
in my city.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.910
She also teaches yoga on YouTube, so you can
check out the link to her channel in the description.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.650
Here you're going to meet Gayle.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.590
Vanessa: Gayle teaches yoga, and she talks
about her journey, getting into yoga, and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.380
just what it means to her life.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.750
I'm sure you also have hobbies and passions
and interests, so it's a good way to hear

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.670
how she talks about it, and to try to imitate
that style of speaking, because we all want

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.150
to talk about our passions and share them
with other people.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.540
Vanessa: Throughout the conversation you're
going to see little subtitles pop up.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.330
These are for vocabulary expressions, phrasal
verbs, and also some special pronunciation.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.540
After the conversation with Gayle, you're
going to also have a vocabulary lesson today.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.540
Wow!

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.350
You're going to see my husband, Dan, and I
explain these vocabulary expressions in detail.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.671
This is a really great way to engrain them
in your memory, and I know a lot of you have

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.380
difficulties with remembering words after
you've learned them.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.430
So, hearing them in the conversation with
Gayle is a good first step, but it's also

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.590
great to hear us talk about it later, give
examples, make it more vivid in your mind.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.720
Vanessa: So, you're going to watch that vocabulary
lesson, and then you're going to watch a phrasal

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720
verb lesson.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.320
This grammar lesson is super helpful for helping
you sound like a native speaker, because we

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.360
use phrasal verbs all the time.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.290
Vanessa: Finally, we're going to practice
some in-depth pronunciation so that you can

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.770
speak exactly the way that Gayle and I did
in our conversation.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.680
Are you ready to hear a real English conversation?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.770
If you enjoy this lesson today I hope that
you can join the Fearless Fluency Club, which

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.810
is my monthly course.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.909
You'll get information and lessons like this
every month.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.720
This is just a short clip from it.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.480
About half of the material, or actually less
than half, maybe a third of the material,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.440
but you'll get an even longer lesson sent
every month when you join the course.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440
Vanessa: Alright!

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.069
Let's meet Gayle and learn real English.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.869
Vanessa: Hi, everyone!

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.489
I'm here today with Gayle.

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.499
Gayle: Hi.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:18.110
Vanessa: We're going to talk about yoga and
all of your experience with that, and really

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.231
anything that comes up along the way.

00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:22.231
Gayle: Sounds great.

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:23.231
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:24.231
So, can we start at the very beginning?

00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:25.519
When did you first start with yoga?

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.919
Then we'll go on to what's happening now.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.200
Gayle: Well, that's interesting.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.359
I was living in New York City at the time,
pursuing a career as a professional freelance

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.359
photographer.

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.359
Vanessa: Oh!

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.359
Quite different from yoga.

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.359
Gayle: Yeah.

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.359
Although, you know, everything kind of ... It's
a lot about your vision and being mindful

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.519
and exploring.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.060
And so, they kind of weave together in some
ways.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.060
Vanessa: I could see that.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.060
Gayle: But anyway!

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.239
I just dabbled in it.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.469
One thing that I always remember, and, I think,
one of the funniest things, is my first class

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.590
when the teacher said, "Pay attention to your
breath.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.819
Like, focus on your breath."

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.330
I thought, "That is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.669
Like, I'm here to move and do some cool poses.

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.439
Like, why would I think about my breath?

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.750
I'm breathing."

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.889
Right!

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.430
So, let's get to the good stuff.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.430
You know?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.140
Gayle: Then as I progressed in my yoga, I
just realized like, breath is everything.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.290
Breath is so key.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.700
So, now I focus on that, or I try to focus
on that, more than anything.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.980
It's really a powerful healing mechanism.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.980
Yeah.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.980
We do it all the time.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.969
It's part of our sympathetic nervous system,
so we'll breathe.

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.360
I mean, if we tried to stop breathing we'd
pass out and then we'd breathe again.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.859
Vanessa: Your body wants to breathe.

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:32.859
Gayle: Right.

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.989
But still, there's ways of like, breathing
more fully, breathing more mindfully, that

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.150
can, you know, help your overall health.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.250
Vanessa: That's funny that at the beginning
you thought, "What is she talking about?"

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.889
Gayle: I thought it was ridiculous.

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.389
Vanessa: Especially if you've never heard
that kind of phrasing before.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.389
Gayle: Yeah!

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.540
Vanessa: Everyone breathes.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:01.510
I feel like, for me, whenever they talk about
breathing in yoga class, I realize, "Oh, I

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.810
have been breathing all this time, all day,
and haven't been thinking about it."

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.209
Then when you start to think about it maybe
it's just that physical element, but I kind

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.419
of ... It clears my mind a little bit.

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:17.260
Once you focus on breathing it's not hypnotic,
but I almost feel like I'm in the zone or

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.190
like, when you're thinking about your breath
you can focus more on what's going on, at

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.190
least for me.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.190
Gayle: No.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.190
That's totally it.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.190
Here's the thing.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.420
Yoga is about union, and the union of opposites
complementing each other.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.460
So, the breath is composed of two opposites,
right?

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.220
The exhale and the exhale, and it's kind of
got an ebb and flow.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.560
So, like, if you sit by the ocean or by a
waterfall when you have that kind of constant

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.750
repeating noise, it really relaxes you.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.640
So, when you turn into your breath, it's kind
of the same thing.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.250
Gayle: A lot of the times when you pay attention
to your breath, you might realize that your

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.840
inhale is stronger than your exhale.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.600
What we're really trying to do is balance
the breath, because the inhale is more energetic

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.480
and the exhale is more relaxing and soothing.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.690
So, if you're like, feeling stressed out or
anything like that, if you just take moment,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.280
focus on the breath, and really letting that
exhale draw out, it's amazing how much it

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280
can calm you.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.930
Gayle: You're like, totally right on there.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.170
Vanessa: This seems like a simple thing, but
it could do a lot.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.170
Gayle: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.980
Vanessa: So, I'm curious what happened after
that.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.960
First, you were at class, you thought, "What
in the world is she talking about?

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960
Breath?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960
Okay."

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.500
Did you just go in full force after that,
or was there just a slow progression?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.530
Because you've been doing yoga for ...
Gayle: A long time.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.740
Vanessa: A long time.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.210
Gayle: It was like ... I dabbled.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.010
You know, when I was in New York City I dabbled.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.750
Like, sometimes I would go to class, but I
never completely committed like I did later

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.750
on.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.620
So, I dabbled in New York, and then I moved
from New York to Bryson City, North Carolina

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.900
and got into white water paddling.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.520
Gayle: So, occasionally ... I knew how to
do sun salutations and occasionally I would

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.050
do some yoga.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.450
I was teaching kayaking at that point, also
white water kayaking.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.070
So, occasionally I'd lead people through a
little bit of yoga but not that often.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.450
But then when I left Bryson City and moved
to Asheville, that's when I really committed,

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.770
and I found a class I liked.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.770
It was just like, Tuesday night, that's what
I was doing.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.770
Yoga.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.400
Gayle: I did that class religiously for two
years.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400
Vanessa: Oh!

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400
That's dedication.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400
Gayle: Yeah.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.170
Then the yoga teacher started offering yoga
teacher trainings.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.550
So, I thought, "Oh, I'll do that.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.560
You know, I don't know if I want to teach
but, you know, I'll just ... Why not?"

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.800
I wanted to learn more.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.060
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.140
Gayle: And so, that helped to grow it more.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.240
So, I got to the point where instead of like,
waiting for what the teacher was going to

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.070
say, I could do my own poses.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.760
Vanessa: You had that confidence to just branch
out yourself.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.590
Gayle: And so, then after that I stopped going
to yoga classes because I'm like, "I want

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.830
to breathe how I want to breathe.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.280
And I want to take as long in a pose as I
want to take, and not just be dictated to

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.720
all the time."

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.600
I learned a lot of poses, I understood them
more.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.930
So, I started more of my own practice.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:05.460
Gayle: But then, unfortunately, I got this
tech job where I was sitting at a desk, and

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.892
I was sitting, and sitting, and sitting.

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:09.410
I had never sat so much in my whole life.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.870
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.960
Gayle: Oh!

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.970
I knew it was.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.700
But I just thought, "I've got to do this."

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.700
Vanessa: Sure.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.270
Gayle: But it did take a toll on me, and actually,
I had a habit, which I wasn't even aware of,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.431
but I would lean on my left elbow, put my
chin, and stare at the screen, and then, you

00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:29.100
know, use the mouse here.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.660
I had meanwhile, had kind of lapsed in my
yoga, hadn't really done yoga in a while.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.660
Like, a while.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.180
Gayle: Then I went to a yoga class, and I
couldn't reach my arms, lying down to the

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.760
floor.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.840
I couldn't do dolphin pose, and I was like,
"What's up with my shoulders?"

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.380
My left shoulder had lost all this range of
motion from doing this thing.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.950
Sitting like that for hours at a time.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.430
Vanessa: That can make a big difference.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.430
Gayle: Yeah.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.920
Vanessa: That's just an unconscious movement
that you're making.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.160
Gayle: Right.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160
I thought, "What happened?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160
I didn't fall on my shoulder.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160
Like, why would it be like this?"

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.690
As soon as I thought, "I'll observe myself,"
which is one of the things that yoga teaches

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:11.419
you, also, is to observe yourself and to get
to know yourself better, even though you think,

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:13.220
"Well, of course I know myself.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.220
I'm myself."

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.370
Vanessa: I know I'm breathing all the time!

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.370
Gayle: Yeah.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.540
So, as soon as I saw that, I knew that's what
it was because I was rounding forward, stretching

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.550
this, weakening this.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.360
And so, it took me like, a year to rehab.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.030
But it was yoga that kind of showed me, and
that's what yoga will do.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.510
It'll show you your limitations.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.690
It can show you where you're injured.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.889
It can show you like, the good stuff and the
bad stuff, essentially.

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:40.760
Gayle: Then it's up to you to pay more attention,
to deal with it, and to not be ... not like,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.120
get too wound up in self criticism.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.360
You know, because you realize like, "Well,
I'm not very strong or I'm really limited."

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360
Yeah.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360
Exactly.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.560
So, that was like, a whole journey.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.720
Then I decided to teach yoga.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.020
Vanessa: Oh!

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.320
Gayle: Yeah.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.699
Then I really got into it, and I started off
teaching in businesses around Asheville, did

00:09:02.699 --> 00:09:03.699
that for a while.

00:09:03.699 --> 00:09:06.590
Vanessa: So, the businesses would just hire
a yoga teacher to come in and like, teach

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.590
their employees?

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.590
Gayle: Yeah.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.590
I mean ...
Vanessa: That's amazing.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.439
Gayle: All businesses should do that.

00:09:12.439 --> 00:09:13.439
Bring yoga to your business.

00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:14.629
Vanessa: That's a great idea.

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:15.629
Gayle: Yeah.

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:20.920
So, I had a couple places like Volvo and Liberty
Bikes, and, you know, a couple other offices

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.160
that would bring me in.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.470
A lot of times the company would pay.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.069
Sometimes the people would pay.

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:29.660
So, that was good.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.589
But then that kind of dried up a little bit.

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:35.430
And so, then I got into teaching more public
classes, and teaching privates.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.410
Gayle: That's what I really like, is teaching
privates.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.319
Because it was one on one.

00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:43.620
I could focus on that person and what they
need.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.620
It's interesting.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.670
In a class people are trying to cue to the
common issue, but there's other people that

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.670
are going to get ignored.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.920
If they don't understand like, how to pay
attention to their body, the cues might not

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.430
even be the best cues for them.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.300
Vanessa: Like, what the teacher is suggesting.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300
Gayle: Yes.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.829
And as I've gone through the years it's like,
things that I thought or was taught years

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:07.730
ago, I'm questioning now.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.920
I'm realizing that things are changing.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.430
20 years ago people didn't think fascia was
important.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.880
Like, when they would cut up a cadaver it's
just like, "Get this wrapping paper out of

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880
the way."

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880
You know?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.529
Now it's like, we realize the fascia is this
big connected network that connects everything

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:24.529
in our body.

00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:28.089
Gayle: So, even though our muscles have points
of origin and insertion, really the whole

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:33.139
muscle's connected via the fascia to all like,
our whole body.

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:37.249
So, if I like, pulled on my shirt, you know,
this hole ... There's going to be a whole

00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:40.050
thread that's going to feel that tug.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.050
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.050
It's all connected in some way.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.050
Gayle: Yeah.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.930
That brings us back to yoga is about connection.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.149
So, in a way, the last pose that you almost
always do in a yoga practice is called [shavasana

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.149
00:11:05].

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:53.600
It literally translates to corpse pose.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.889
So, in a way, it's like practicing our own
death and letting go, because death is the

00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:59.180
ultimate letting go.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.509
Just can we let go, and can you relax in savasana?

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:03.920
For some people it's the hardest pose.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.540
Gayle: They just want to jump up and run and
start doing things again.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.220
You know, their mind is so busy.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.069
But can you relax your mind, relax your body,
and the two are very connected, so that when

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:17.319
your body's relaxed it is easier to relax
your mind.

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:21.410
If you've been focusing on your breath the
whole time doing your yoga practice, you will

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.300
feel more centered, because you haven't been
thinking about all the other stuff that's

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.360
driving you crazy.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.360
Right?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.930
Gayle: So, you know, it's like, a whole really
interesting system.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.519
Then you can come into the whole thing of
what is yoga.

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:35.519
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.519
What is yoga?

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:37.519
Gayle: You know, is it just mindfulness?

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:38.519
Mindful action?

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:41.189
Being aware of your thoughts?

00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:44.949
You know, they say your thoughts become words,
and your words become actions, and your actions

00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:47.139
becomes your life.

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:49.839
We oftentimes, you know, myself, very much
so.

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:55.250
You think about all this negativity and don't
realize like, that has a lot of implications

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.250
down the road.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.660
Vanessa: I think that's been pretty proven
that your thoughts have a physical effect

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.589
on your life, whether it's just your mental
health or your body's physical health.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:04.589
Gayle: Right.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:09.439
Vanessa: Like, what you think is really important,
and if yoga can help you to kind of calm down

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:13.940
those anxious thoughts or whatever else is
going on, that's great.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.389
It's also good exercise, but it works for
your mind.

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:18.389
That's really awesome.

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:19.389
Gayle: Right.

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:24.390
We just, you know ... There's different types
of yoga, different styles, and some yoga can

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.829
be more rigorous, vigorous.

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:27.829
Some is more relaxing.

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:31.579
But I think we need to balance it, because
yoga's also about balance.

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:34.529
How do we balance opposite actions, opposite
energies?

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:36.350
Like, the breath, the inhale, the exhale.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.619
There's a rising up, kind of an energizing
on the inhale, then there's a relaxing, settling

00:12:41.619 --> 00:12:43.720
down, connecting to the earth on the exhale.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.509
Gayle: And so, in every yoga pose ... Like,
the asanas, the poses, are really a way of

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:52.920
bringing things up for you, and noticing like,
are you impatient?

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.830
Do you have a lot of negative self talk?

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.830
Are you distracted?

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.990
Are you just like, thinking, "I just want
to get this done," but meanwhile you're thinking

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.790
about what you're going to eat after class.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.790
Vanessa: Yep!

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:09.140
Gayle: But if you can be fully present in
the moment, in this moment, then that's when

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.579
your mind starts to relax.

00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:15.170
You do have that sense of ... At the end of
yoga class, it's really interesting how people

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.779
will feel very relaxed, but also have energy.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:21.650
But it's not that crazy kind of energy that
just like, you know ...

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.650
Vanessa: It's not chaotic.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.650
Gayle: Yeah.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.810
It's like, really getting your nervous system
all wound up.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:31.370
It's a more like, you know, I'm ready for
whatever life presents kind of energy, and

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.569
I have energy to do things, and I feel inspired.

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:35.509
Vanessa: That's the kind of energy you want.

00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:36.509
Gayle: Yeah.

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:37.610
People think it's all about flexibility.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.110
Well, it's about balance.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:45.499
It's about building strength and flexibility,
and trying to have the two be more or less

00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:48.339
equal, so one isn't overpowering the other.

00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:53.329
And also to have different muscle groups balanced,
so, you know ... For example, oftentimes our

00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:55.810
quads are really strong, but the hamstrings
are weak.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.230
That's like, really common.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:03.860
Gayle: So, you know, a good practice, which
takes some thought and takes some like, kind

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:10.279
of understanding what's going on, is to try
and balance those two energies.

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:13.860
But the more ... That's why it's nice to have
a home practice too, because you might discover

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:19.480
something in a yoga class that was brought
up, and then you can practice on, you know,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.480
practice that at home.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.480
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.769
Taking care of yourself in the way that you
need to do, not just what the teacher has

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:28.739
prepared for the day, which is kind of like,
learning English.

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:32.200
You know, maybe go to a class and the teacher
says, "Hey, we're going to talk about this

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.240
today," but you want to learn that and other
things.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.529
You know, taking charge of your own education
or exercise is always going to be a recipe

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:41.529
for success.

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:44.509
Vanessa: How did you enjoy that conversation
with Gayle?

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.079
Was it a little fast?

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:47.550
Was it a little tricky?

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.550
Did you understand everything?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:52.910
What we're going to do now is we're going
to go on to the vocabulary lesson.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.209
You're going to see my husband, Dan, and I,
going back and explaining some vocabulary

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:58.929
expressions that we used in that conversation.

00:14:58.929 --> 00:15:03.959
You're going to see a short clip from the
conversation with Gayle, so that you can remember,

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:04.959
"Oh, yeah.

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.000
That's what she said."

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Vanessa: Alright.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.690
Let's go on to the vocabulary lesson.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.759
The first expression we're going to talk about
today is vision.

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:12.759
Dan: Vision.

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:16.870
Vanessa: What does this literally mean, and
then we're going to talk about it in the figurative

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.870
sense.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.730
Dan: Well, it literally just means your sight.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.730
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.730
To see.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.730
Dan: Yes.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.730
My vision is seeing the room.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.730
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.730
So, do you have good vision?

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.730
Poor vision?

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.730
Dan: Oh.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.799
So, my real vision is very bad.

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:34.269
I have to go to the eye doctor and get classes
and contacts.

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:36.509
Right now I'm wearing contacts.

00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:37.639
They kind of hurt my eyes.

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:38.639
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.540
Your prescription is pretty strong because
you have poor vision.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.540
Dan: Yes.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.540
I have poor vision.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.540
Vanessa: Yes.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.730
Dan: It's a general way to describe sight.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.749
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative), but if we want
to talk about this in a figurative way, you

00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:53.309
can kind of imagine your mind or your heart
seeing in the future.

00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:55.620
It's kind of your plan or goal for the future.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.620
Dan: Yes.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.529
Vanessa: What is your vision for the future?

00:15:58.529 --> 00:15:59.959
You might even use this for English.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.639
"I have a vision for my English studies.

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.649
I'm going to become a fluent English speaker.

00:16:04.649 --> 00:16:08.199
I'm going to speak confidently and make a
lot of friends around the world."

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:09.199
That's my vision.

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:10.199
It's kind of your dream.

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:16.620
Dan: I think it is more emotional than plan
or goal, because essentially it's a plan or

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.149
a goal but when you say it's a vision you're
picturing yourself in that moment, how you're

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:25.579
going to feel, what's your vision for your
English lessons?

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:32.610
Are you envisioning going to America and meeting
all the new people, meeting Vanessa and speaking

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.620
perfect English?

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.620
Vanessa: Whoa!

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.620
Dan: That's your vision.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.230
Vanessa: So, you can tell there's a lot of
emotion behind this, a lot of passion behind

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.230
it.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.059
It's your vision, and that's pretty much how
Gayle used it in the conversation.

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:45.059
Dan: Yes.

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:47.350
Vanessa: When she talked about her vision.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.519
I think that you'll see that in the clip in
just a moment.

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:50.869
Are you ready to watch it?

00:16:50.869 --> 00:16:51.869
Dan: I'm ready.

00:16:51.869 --> 00:16:52.869
Vanessa: Alright.

00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:53.869
Let's watch.

00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:54.869
Gayle: Yeah.

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:57.009
Although, you know, everything kind of ... It's
a lot about your vision and being mindful

00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:58.509
and exploring.

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:00.990
And so, they kind of weave together in some
ways.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.500
Gayle: It's a lot about your vision and being
mindful.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.190
Gayle: It's a lot about your vision and being
mindful.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:14.130
Dan: The next expression is a casual expression,
and it is to dabble in something.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.920
And this basically just means to try something.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.490
But it means try something not seriously.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.120
So, "I dabbled in baking."

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.860
Actually over this last holiday I baked some
waffles.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.840
It was Belgian waffles, really sweet dessert
waffles.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.710
I would say I just dabble in baking, because
I only make that every now and then.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.710
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:43.010
You don't bake every week or every day, just
every couple months you make these amazing

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.430
Belgian waffles.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.780
But it's just, you know, casually, not so
seriously, every now and then.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.780
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.240
Vanessa: So, you can use this for really any
hobby that you do that's not so serious.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.590
So, that's how Gayle used it.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.590
She said that, "I dabbled in yoga."

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.590
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.700
Vanessa: I did it occasionally, maybe once
a month, maybe once every couple months.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.210
It wasn't a big important part of her life.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.300
Dan: Yeah.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.260
When I've heard this used it's usually when
somebody asked you if you do something, and

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.260
you just say, "Eh.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.260
I dabble."

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.260
Vanessa: Oh.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.980
So, you don't want to show them, "I'm so serious
about this."

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.980
Dan: Yeah.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.040
Vanessa: You just want to say, "Oh, it's not
so serious.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040
Oh, yeah.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.910
I dabbled in art for a while.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.070
I dabbled in painting, but, you know, it wasn't
anything serious."

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.070
Dan: Right.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.320
Vanessa: So, you're kind of being modest.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.660
You're not really saying, "I love this!"

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.660
Dan: Yeah.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.660
"I do it all the time!"

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.710
Vanessa: Oh, yeah!

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.360
Instead it's a little more casual than that.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.150
So, I hope that you'll be able to see that
from the conversation with Gayle.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.150
Let's watch it.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.150
Gayle: I just dabbled in it.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.121
One thing that I always remember ...
Gayle: I just dabbled in it.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.350
Gayle: I just dabbled in it.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.130
Vanessa: The next expression is to be mindful.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.420
Dan: Mindful.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.700
Vanessa: Mindful.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.060
Your mind is your brain.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.110
So, you can kind of imagine here that you
are aware.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.060
You are intentional.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.270
You're not doing something by accident.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.270
You are intentional.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.060
You're doing it consciously.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.510
You are aware.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.950
You are mindful.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:07.530
This is a word that's often linked with yoga,
because you are not just doing say, boxing,

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.670
where you're punching.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.670
No.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.540
Vanessa: Instead you're thinking about each
muscle.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.740
It's kind of slow and careful.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.210
So, you're in your mind, you're thinking about
each movement, you are mindful.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.770
You're careful and intentional.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.770
Dan: Yes.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.210
Vanessa: With each movement.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.300
We can use that for other activities as well.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.300
So, what about for you?

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.300
How would you use mindful?

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:32.170
Dan: Well, I think this has become a pretty
popular thing in modern society.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.440
Actually, we have a whole extra term, which
is mindfulness.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.530
Vanessa: Mmm.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.450
Dan: So, this is the art of being mindful.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:46.410
I assume that probably, you know, 100 years
ago, everybody was being mindful at some point,

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.460
because they had more time.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.110
Vanessa: And they didn't have too many things
to distract them, like screens.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.110
Dan: Yeah.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.110
Not as many distractions.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.860
But now you have to say, "I practice mindfulness."

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.860
Vanessa: Mmm.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.440
Dan: So, that just means at some point in
the day I stop and I think about my body,

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.993
my thoughts ...
Vanessa: My life.

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.150
Dan: What's just going on in my mind?

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.490
I'm not looking at my phone.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.730
I'm not watching a TV show.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.730
I'm being mindful.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.730
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.780
I think that that's actually a really good
New Year's Resolution that a lot of people

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.970
make, is, "I'm going to be mindful every day."

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.300
It could just be, "Okay, I'm going to sit
down for 10 seconds, and just sit down and

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.830
breathe, and think about nothing, or think
about, 'Oh, what was my posture like?

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.330
How do I feel today?'"

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.300
Dan: Let the emotions hit you right, left,
anger, sorrow!

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.750
Vanessa: And really just [crosstalk 00:20:49]
conscious about that, being mindful about

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.750
it.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:43.510
Or we can use this same idea and talk about
more of a concrete situation.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:50.140
So, for example, if you are a teacher and
you have a classroom, you have to be mindful

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.350
of all of the students' behavior.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.860
This means aware of their behavior.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.870
Just like I'm mindful of myself, I'm aware
of my own thoughts and feelings, you can be

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.760
mindful of the students, and kind of aware
of that situation?

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.400
Vanessa: What about the verb to mind?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400
Just to mind something.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400
Vanessa: How would you use that?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.910
Dan: I mean, it's basically the same thing,
be aware, but it's almost like, be careful.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.840
Like, mind the puddle.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.060
Vanessa: It's usually used as some kind of
warning.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.790
Like, "Mind the puddle!"

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.340
That might be a little bit ...
Dan: Don't step in the puddle.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.340
Vanessa: Old English, maybe?

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.370
Dan: It's not super common.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.250
Vanessa: I feel like there's a phrase where
we definitely use it.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.250
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.250
What's that?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.250
Vanessa: Mind your manners.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.250
Dan: Oh, that's right.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.250
Of course.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.890
Vanessa: I know that parents say this all
the time.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.580
If you were a kid and you were at the dinner
table, you just had your hands everywhere,

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.960
and you're eating, your parents would probably
say, "Mind your manners."

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.960
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.510
Vanessa: This means be careful of your manners.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.980
Don't put your hands all over the table.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.120
Be kind of more responsible and mature.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120
Mind your manners.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:02.250
This is also definitely an old term, but it's
carried over into modern popular culture.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.250
Vanessa: Yes.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.650
Have you ever visited London and seen this
expression?

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.610
Do you remember where this is in London?

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.660
Dan: Mind the gap?

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.660
Vanessa: Mind the gap!

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.660
Yes.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:18.070
If you go on the subway or the underground,
or they call it the tube, everywhere there's

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.710
signs that say, "Mind the gap."

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.000
The gap is the space between the platform
and the train.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Don't fall there.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
It's dangerous.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
So, they're saying, "Watch out!"

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Dan: Remember.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Vanessa: Be careful.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Dan: Look.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Vanessa: Of the gap.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
But it's a really polite way of saying, "Mind
the gap.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Be careful."

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.330
So, if you go to London you might see that
expression everywhere.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.000
You might even hear the announcer say, "Mind
the gap as you get on the train."

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.710
Dan: But would you say, "Be mindful of the
gap?"

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.010
Vanessa: You could.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.010
It makes sense.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.010
Dan: Technically, it's right.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.010
Vanessa: It's a little bit weird.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.010
Dan: It's strong.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.010
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.010
It's like, a little bit too strong.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.450
Dan: Be mindful of is like, really watch.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.980
You can work with this thing.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.260
You can't really work with a hole in the ground.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.260
You're just trying to miss it.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.260
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.450
Avoid the gap in the ground.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.450
Just step over it.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.450
Yeah.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:06.050
So, I feel like if you say, "Be mindful of
something," it's more, "Be thoughtful about

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.050
it.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.050
Think about it."

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.160
Kind of more than inner feeling like, with
yoga.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160
Vanessa: Alright.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.840
Let's watch the clip so that you can see how
it was used.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.600
Gayle: But still, there's ways of like, breathing
more fully, breathing more mindfully, that

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.890
can, you know, help your overall health.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.410
Gayle: There's ways of like, breathing more
fully, breathing more mindfully.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.920
Gayle: There's ways of like, breathing more
fully, breathing more mindfully.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.010
Dan: The next expression is to clear your
mind.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.120
This is a pretty self explanatory expression.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.190
It just means to forget, usually, your problems.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.190
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.190
Yes.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.780
We can imagine you're erasing the problems,
you're clearing the problems from your mind.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.780
Dan: Yeah.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.150
It might not even just be problems.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.290
Maybe you're just doing a lot of things.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.751
Maybe there's a lot of noise around you.

00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:52.540
So, you need to go outside.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.680
I would say usually it's going outside to
clear your mind.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.680
Vanessa: Yes.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.870
I this was something that happened to us a
couple months ago over Christmas break.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.060
We went to Dan's parents' house.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.350
There were a lot of people there.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.760
Every day there was so much going on, especially
when we were running after our toddler.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.540
It was just so busy.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.370
Every day it was like, "Okay, we need to get
outside, clear our minds."

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:23.560
So, every day we went for a walk, we went
to the park, and it was kind of necessary,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:28.380
because in that busy environment we're not
really worried or, you know, stressed.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.890
It's just a lot going on.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.710
Vanessa: So, it's nice to step outside, and
clear your mind.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:34.710
Dan: Yeah.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:39.070
I definitely would say though, it is mostly
associated with stress.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.800
So, if you're ...
Vanessa: It was a little bit stressful with

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.860
lots of people and a toddler.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.860
Dan: It was.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.860
Yes.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.240
So, like, if you're in an argument with somebody,
and you just need to walk away because you

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.690
can't solve the problem now, you might need
to say, "I just need to go and clear my mind.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.700
We'll come back to this problem."

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.960
Vanessa: That's a very responsible thing to
say.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.670
"Go clear my mind, and then we'll get back
to this."

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.160
Vanessa: Just to let you know, a quick grammar
about this, make sure that our possessive

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:12.270
pronoun, clear my mind, clear his mind ... Make
sure that it matches with the subject.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.800
You can't say, "I need to clear his mind."

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800
Dan: No.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.800
Vanessa: I, his.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.800
It doesn't really work.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800
You can only clear your mind.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800
Dan: That sounds like a threat.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.260
Vanessa: I need to clear his mind!

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.620
Kind of like you're going to erase his memory.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.840
So, instead, make sure that your subject matches
that possessive pronoun.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.290
He needs to clear his mind.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.880
She needs to clear her mind.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.370
I need to clear my mind.

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.370
Vanessa: Alright.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:37.370
Let's watch the clip.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.490
Vanessa: Then when you start to think about
it maybe it's just that physical element,

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.890
but I kind of ... It clears my mind a little
bit.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.170
Vanessa: It clears my mind a little bit.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.220
Vanessa: It clears my mind a little bit.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.990
Vanessa: The next expression is one that I
love.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.600
It's to be in the zone.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.780
We can kind of imagine here, this thing that
Dan's doing with his hands.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.780
In the zone.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.310
You're completely focused.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.870
You're not looking at other things.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.870
You're not distracted.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.580
You're so focused, you are in the zone.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.270
We can kind of imagine that mental thing that's
happening where your mind is blocking out

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.160
other things.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.160
You are in the zone.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.160
Dan: Yeah.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.160
You're not thinking about anything else.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160
Vanessa: Yes.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.160
I mentioned this in the conversation with
Gayle.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:23.330
This happens to me in yoga class sometimes,
if I really concentrate on breathing, and

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.700
then also my emotions, I am thinking about
my breathing, I am thinking about my emotions.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.300
There's not space in my brain to think about
other things.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.260
So, I kind of forget what's for dinner.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.910
I forget what else I was doing.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.130
I can just focus.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.160
I can be in the zone.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.290
It's kind of a great place to be.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.840
Vanessa: You feel relaxed.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.200
You're blocking out other distractions, as
long as that's okay.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200
So, what about for you?

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.620
When have you been in the zone?

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.620
Dan: Yeah.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.440
I definitely used this term for sports.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.870
So, when I play hockey I get in the zone.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.340
I'm not thinking about anything else.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:03.960
But I would also say for sports, when we say,
"in the zone," that also means you're playing

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.960
very well.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.960
Vanessa: Oh, right.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.800
Dan: Like, if you said, "he's in the zone,"
that means that he is scoring goals.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.610
He's playing really well.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.720
He's not making many mistakes.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.870
Vanessa: He's not distracted by other things.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.870
He's doing well.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:17.870
You're in the zone.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.090
Vanessa: So, I want to know for you.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.240
You can even use this when you're studying
English.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.090
When you're studying English, are you so focused,
you're so into it, your brain is tuning out

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:32.500
other things, your brain is ... You're clearing
your mind of other things, and you're in the

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.060
zone, and studying English.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.350
Vanessa: I want to know if that has ever happened
to you?

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.960
Maybe there's a lot going on in your house,
where it's not so possible ...

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960
Dan: Yes.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.130
I think they call it a flow state, as well.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.130
Vanessa: Oh.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.130
Sure.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.130
Your brain is just flowing, and you're just
going.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:47.130
Dan: In the flow.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.130
Vanessa: In the flow.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.340
That's another great way to say this.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.340
In the zone.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.340
In the flow.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.910
It means you're just going, and going, and
going.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.220
You're really on the ball.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.670
Oh, so many good expressions.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.110
Dan: On the ball too!

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.110
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.640
You're on the ball, you're really just focused.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.070
So, I hope that all of these expressions,
in the zone, on the ball ...

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.070
Dan: In the flow.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.070
Vanessa: In the flow.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.110
I hope that all of those are useful to you.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.410
To me, the similar thing of focused.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.410
Vanessa: Alright.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.410
Let's watch the clip.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.580
Vanessa: I almost feel like I'm in the zone
or like, when you're thinking about your breath

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.400
you can ...
Vanessa: I almost feel like I'm in the zone

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.330
or ...
Vanessa: I almost feel like I'm in the zone

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.160
or ...
Dan: The next expressions is religiously.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.130
This just means to have full commitment to
something.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.130
Vanessa: Yes.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.890
Dan: Almost in like, a spiritual way.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:37.760
I would say nine times out of 10, you're going
to use this as a joke or as hyperbole.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.960
Vanessa: Exaggeration.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.150
Dan: Yes.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.150
So, "I eat pizza religiously."

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.920
Vanessa: It doesn't mean that three times
a day you eat pizza.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.490
That would be literally religiously.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.460
Dan: Well, it would also mean you go to the
pizza and you worship the pizza.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.080
Vanessa: It's not that.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.080
Dan: No.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.530
You don't pray to pizza.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:01.550
You just love pizza so much, and you eat it
very often, and very regularly.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.550
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.700
But it doesn't mean actually that you treat
it like a religious.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.840
So, in this way it's a hyperbole, which is
a great way of saying an exaggeration.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.430
Dan: Yeah, and I mean, technically, you could
use this in a religious, a true religious

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.430
sense.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.790
Like, "I go to church religiously."

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.790
Vanessa: Oh.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.790
It actually is religion.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.790
Dan: Yeah.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.790
Vanessa: But you mean the same thing.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.790
You do it often.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:24.790
You're committed.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:25.790
You treat it seriously.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:31.330
Dan: Or if you say, "I prayed at church religiously,"
that doesn't really make sense, because it's

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.330
a given.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.330
You're at church.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.610
Vanessa: Of course, you're going to be doing
it religiously.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.610
Dan: Of course, it's religion.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.610
Right.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.610
Vanessa: So, I want to know for you, is there
anything that you do religiously?

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.220
I know I can think of one thing.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.810
Dan: Oh, no.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:41.810
You can?

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:42.810
Vanessa: Yes.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:43.810
Drink coffee!

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.810
Dan: Oh!

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:45.810
That's true!

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:46.810
I do drink coffee religiously.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.810
Vanessa: Yes.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.560
If Dan ...
Dan: I maybe do pray to it too.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.750
Vanessa: Secretly.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.540
Dan: Thank you.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.280
Vanessa: If you don't have coffee in a day,
I'm pretty surprised.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.000
Like, it happens every day religiously.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
You're committed to it.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.830
It happens every single day.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.900
You can kind of see it's a little bit of a
joke.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.900
Dan: It's funny.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.900
Vanessa: It's funny because ...
Dan: I'm committed to coffee.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.540
Vanessa: You're committed to coffee.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.200
Dan: I'm following coffee.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200
Vanessa: Yes.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200
Dan: To my grave.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200
Vanessa: Yes.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.200
So, I want to know, for you, what is something
that you do religiously?

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.960
It can be a little bit of an exaggeration.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960
That's fine.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.180
Or something silly like coffee.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.700
Do you drink coffee religiously?

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.320
Vanessa: I would say I drink tea, but I don't
drink tea religiously.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:29.750
I don't drink tea absolutely every single
day, and if I don't have it there's a problem.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.830
Dan: You don't do very many things religiously.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.940
Vanessa: Oh, yeah?

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.350
Dan: Yeah.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.350
It's just chaos.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.850
Vanessa: Just chaos!

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:39.860
Dan: Clearly.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.750
Vanessa: I, especially with teaching English,
there's a lot of things that I do religiously.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.170
Dan: We hope you religiously watch Vanessa's
videos.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:48.290
Vanessa: Oh!

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.310
That means that you are committed.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.400
Dan: Pray to Vanessa.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.840
Vanessa: It doesn't mean that.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.840
Dan: Worship Vanessa.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.620
Vanessa: It doesn't mean that.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.460
It means that you are doing it consistently.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.940
Dan: That's what I do.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.060
Vanessa: I hope that it's something that's
a part of your daily life, at least learning

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.060
English is.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.060
Vanessa: Alright.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.060
Let's watch the clip, so that you can see
how it was used.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.700
Gayle: I did that class religiously for two
years.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.700
Vanessa: Oh!

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.700
That's dedication.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.840
Gayle: I did that class religiously for two
years.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.510
Gayle: I did that class religiously for two
years.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:20.330
Vanessa: The next expression is a great idiom,
to take a toll or to take its toll.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.420
Dan: Take its toll.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.840
Vanessa: Both of these are the exact same
thing.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.280
We had a long discussion about what's the
difference between these two, and in the end

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.510
we came to the conclusion that they're exactly
the same.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.510
So, good news!

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.940
You get two for one.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.940
Dan: Yeah.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:33.940
Do you know where it came from?

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:34.940
The term?

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.940
Vanessa: A toll?

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.320
Do you know what a toll is?

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.350
It's like, when you're driving and you have
to pay ...

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.350
Dan: Yes.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.770
Vanessa: To pass to another road.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.770
It's a toll.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.970
Dan: It's a road or a bridge that you have
to pay to cross.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.970
Vanessa: Oh.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.280
Dan: So, that's the original meaning.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.840
I was actually looking this up.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.070
In ancient times, sometimes the toll on the
road was a lot.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.070
Vanessa: Oh.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.111
Dan: It was a lot of money, or you had to
give like, your cattle or something.

00:32:00.111 --> 00:32:01.920
Vanessa: Something really valuable.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.920
Dan: Yeah.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.500
People would really make the toll expensive,
to go across a bridge.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.500
Vanessa: Oh.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.740
Dan: Maybe there's only one bridge and you're
like, "Hey, cross this bridge, but give me

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.740
your cow."

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.430
Vanessa: So, in this sense, back in the day,
it was quite expensive to pay the toll.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.650
Nowadays it's like, a dollar.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.110
Dan: Yeah, there are roads and transport everywhere.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.110
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.970
So, you don't really have to pay that much
nowadays, but this meaning, it kind of seems

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.450
to go back to that original meaning of toll,
to take a toll.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.960
It means that something has gradually, over
time, weakened something.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960
Dan: Yes.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.650
Vanessa: So, let me give you a quick example.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:47.580
You might say that, "I drove my car 60 miles
every day, and it took a toll on my car."

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.580
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.700
Vanessa: That means that driving my car 60
miles every day, that's like, 60 kilometers,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.790
we could say.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.880
60 kilometers every day took a toll on my
car.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.110
It's a lot of driving.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.600
So, my car gradually weakened because of that.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600
It took a toll.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.890
Vanessa: What's another way that we could
say take a toll or take its toll?

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.070
Dan: Yeah You often use this with just your
body.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.070
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.580
Dan: So, maybe your job has taken its toll
on you?

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.480
Or your job took a toll on your body?

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.940
So, if you stand a lot or you sit a lot, or
maybe you're working with machinery, it can

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.940
take a toll.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:29.930
Maybe you get injured, just over time, or
you're 40 years old and all of a sudden, "Oh!

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:30.930
My arm.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.080
I can barely move this arm."

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.080
Right?

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080
Vanessa: Sure.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.820
Dan: Or in the most general sense, you can
even just say, "Life takes its toll."

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.920
Vanessa: That's quite dark.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.970
Dan: Yep.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.970
Vanessa: It's true!

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.250
Over time ...
Dan: As time goes on you just get older and

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.520
weaker, and life is taking its toll.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520
That happens to everybody.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.940
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:55.470
Vanessa: So, when you use this expression
it's implying that something is weakening

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.630
over time.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.100
We could say my car is weakening over time.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.210
We have kind of a cause and effect.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.700
Driving my car 60 miles took its toll on my
car.

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:17.730
The cause is driving 60 miles, and its effecting
my car, or maybe sitting down every day for

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:22.619
eight hours at my office took its toll on
my body.

00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:23.619
We have this ...
Dan: Parenthood ...

00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:24.619
Vanessa: Cause and effect.

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:25.619
Oh!

00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:28.250
Dan: Is taking is toll on my mental well being.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.480
Vanessa: Maybe that's ...
Dan: That's a little strong.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.310
Vanessa: Maybe that's just having a toddler.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:39.630
Vanessa: So, maybe there's something in your
life that is, over time ... The first time

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:44.360
it happens, maybe the second time or third
time, it doesn't really effect you, but gradually

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.760
over time something has weakened you.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:53.720
Maybe that's you physically, or maybe that's
mentally, or it could be something else in

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.790
your life, like your car ... It's taking its
toll.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.960
So, I recommend checking out the lesson guide
so that you can get a couple more sample sentences

00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960
for this.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.540
This is an excellent idiom that we use in
daily conversation.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.119
So, make sure that you're familiar with it.

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:05.119
Vanessa: Alright.

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:06.119
Let's watch the clip.

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:07.920
Gayle: I had never sat so much in my whole
life.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.660
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.660
Gayle: Oh!

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.660
I knew it was.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:12.660
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.050
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:18.030
Dan: The next expression is an idiom, down
the road.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.890
This is not literally down a road.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.710
This just means down in the future ...
Vanessa: Some time in the future.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.030
Dan: Or up in the future.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.240
Some time in the future.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.880
It doesn't mean tomorrow.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.670
It means in a later date, probably over a
year, I'd say.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.670
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.670
It's kind of vague.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:40.460
If you don't want to say exactly when something
will happen, you might say, "Oh, I'd like

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:46.920
to go to Japan down the road," or, "Some day
down the road I hope to be fluent in English."

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.540
This just means in the future.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:55.880
We can kind of imagine the road of life, and
somewhere down the road of life you will go

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.670
to Japan, or you will be fluent in English.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.880
Dan: It's obviously very non-specific and
non-committal.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.100
Maybe it will never happen.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.100
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:13.050
So, you don't want to use this if someone
says, "Hey, can you help me to clean the floor?"

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.720
"Oh, I'll do it down the road."

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.510
That's not a good way to use this.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.300
Dan: Some day down the road I'll clean the
floor for you, honey.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.400
Vanessa: That means maybe next year.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:28.470
So, we want to use this in situations where
it's pretty far in the future, or just some

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.960
unknown time in the future.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:34.619
Maybe some kind of goals you have for your
life, or you have a vision for something that

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:41.190
will happen in the future, and you say, "Oh,
down the road I would like this to happen."

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.760
Dan: Gayle actually used it in a negative
way.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:49.990
She was saying negative thoughts can have
implications down the road, or bad implications,

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:55.290
which means ... This is like, an unspoken
thing that will happen.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:56.290
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:37:02.590
So, something will happen down the road if
you have bad posture, if you don't exercise,

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.230
something negative will happen down the road
if you don't take care of yourself now.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:11.510
So, this might be motivation for you to start
exercising or eating healthy, or making some

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.070
kind of lifestyle change.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:18.590
Vanessa: Well, if I don't start eating more
vegetables, I will be very unhealthy down

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.590
the road.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.770
So, I need to change something now in my life.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.190
You're kind of looking towards that unspecific
time in the future.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.190
Down the road.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.369
This is another lovely expression.

00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:29.650
We've got a lot of lovely expressions in this
lesson.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:31.640
So, I hope that you'll be able to use it yourself.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.560
Vanessa: Let's watch the clip so you can see
how it was originally used.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.520
Gayle: You think about all this negativity
and don't realize like, that has a lot of

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.790
implications down the road.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.350
Gayle: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.790
Gayle: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.800
Vanessa: How did you enjoy that vocabulary
lesson?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.280
I hope that you learned a lot, and you can
include those into your daily vocabulary!

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.850
Vanessa: Next, it's going to be time for the
grammar lesson.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.119
This is phrasal verbs.

00:37:56.119 --> 00:38:00.390
You're going to be learning some important
phrasal verbs, four to be exact, so that you

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.600
can use these and integrate them into your
daily conversation.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.600
Let's watch.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:10.050
Vanessa: The first phrasal verb that we're
going to talk about is to tune in to something.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.830
In the conversation with Gayle, it kind of
sounded like she said turn in, but really

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.200
the expression is to tune into something.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:23.160
This means to have an understanding of something,
maybe a deeper understanding of something.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.600
So, you tune into your thoughts.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.310
It means you're thinking about your thoughts,
tuning into your thoughts.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:32.119
Vanessa: How would you use this get phrasal
verb, to tune in?

00:38:32.119 --> 00:38:36.690
Dan: Well, the first thing that comes to my
mind is tuning into a radio station.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:40.120
Vanessa: This is a good physical, literal
way to use that.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.580
Dan: This is a little more old school, but
people still say this today.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.230
Tuning in for a TV show.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.650
Tune in on Friday to see the brand new episode
of ...

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.710
Vanessa: Dan's TV show.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.500
Dan: Dan's TV show.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.500
Tune in Friday night.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:03.000
Vanessa: So, you can tune into the radio station,
which means that you can try to hear it more

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
clearly.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You're changing the stations.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
You're hearing it more clearly.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.100
But this also works in a figurative way.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.340
Maybe you could tune into your body.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.970
This means that you're thinking about the
different muscles.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.360
How does my back feel right now?

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.410
How do my feet feel?

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.770
You're tuning into the specific understanding.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:20.880
Dan: Yes.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.090
I think, perhaps, the origin of this comes
from tuning in music.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.090
Vanessa: Oh.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:31.600
Dan: So, if you're tuning in, everybody's
trying to get on the same page, and sound

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.600
the same.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.600
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600
So, you're tuning your instrument.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.800
You're making your instruments all sound similar.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.390
So, you could even say this as a teacher.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.610
I need to tune into the needs of my students.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.740
I need to tune into the needs of my students.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.770
Dan: There needs to be harmony.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:48.770
Everything needs to be together.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.320
Vanessa: I need to have a deeper understanding
of the needs of my students.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.810
Vanessa: So, let's go ahead and watch the
clip where you heard tune in.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:58.230
It kind of sounds like turn in, but try to
hear tune in ...

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.230
Dan: Tune in.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.430
Vanessa: Then we're going to talk about a
little bonus expression, which sounds like

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:02.430
the opposite.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.430
Vanessa: Alright.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:04.430
Let's watch the clip.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:05.430
Gayle: ... it really relaxes you.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.560
So, when you turn into your breath, it's kind
of the same thing.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.460
Gayle: ...it really relaxes you.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.580
So, when you turn into your breath, it's kind
of the same thing.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.580
Vanessa: Now for the special extra material
section!

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580
In this section, I'm going to be quickly explaining
some extra material that's not in the conversation

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.580
with Gayle, but it relates to what we just
talked about.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.580
Vanessa: So, we just talked about the phrasal
verb, to tune in.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.580
So, what you're going to do is you're going
to be listening to a short clip from a song

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.580
called Incense and Peppermints by the band
Strawberry Alarm Clock.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.580
In this song they say, "turn in, tune in,
turn your eyes around."

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.580
Vanessa: In this song ... Now, I'm just interpreting
this from my own opinion, but in this song

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.580
they're talking about realizing the world
for what it really is.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.580
Look past all of those false things, all of
the things that everyone says you should pay

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.580
attention to, and tune in, pay attention to,
really understand what matters in life.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.580
Vanessa: So, you're going to listen to this
short clip of the song, and I hope that you'll

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.580
be able to gain a deeper understanding, you'll
be able to tune into the meaning of this song.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.580
Vanessa: Alright.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.580
Let's watch the clip.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.580
Singer: Incense and peppermints, meaningless
nouns.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.580
Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.580
Look at yourself, look at yourself.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.580
Singer: Incense and peppermints, meaningless
nouns.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.580
Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.580
Look at yourself, look at yourself.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.580
Vanessa: The next phrasal verb that we're
talking about is kind of a bonus one.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.580
It wasn't in the conversation with Gayle,
but because we talked about to tune in, I

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.580
thought we'd talk about ... What's the opposite?

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:36.580
Dan: Tune out!

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.580
Vanessa: To tune out.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.580
Dan: La, la, la, la, la.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.580
Vanessa: Yep.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.580
It means that you're ignoring something that
somebody says.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.580
You are not gaining a deeper understanding.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.580
Dan: It's the opposite.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.580
Vanessa: It's the opposite.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.580
You are closing your ears, tuning out.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.580
So, if, maybe you know someone who talks a
lot, or maybe they talk about something that

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.580
you just don't want to hear, you can tune
them out.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.580
Dan: Yeah.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.580
I tuned her out.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.580
Vanessa: Yes.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.580
When she was talking too much.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.580
Dan: Not her, somebody else.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.580
Vanessa: I just tuned her out.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.810
There's someone particular that I'm thinking
of.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:41:02.070
At Christmas this past year, Dan has a family
member who talks all the time.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.070
Dan: Quite a lot.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:08.200
Vanessa: 24, seven, about everything, everything
in the world, every pastry she's ever baked,

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.310
every friend she's ever had who's broken a
hip or an ankle.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:12.830
Oh, and it's just non-stop.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:17.770
So, after a little bit of time I just had
to tune her out.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:18.770
Dan: Yeah.

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.780
Vanessa: I couldn't listen carefully to every
single word.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.890
It's too much.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:22.890
Dan: Yes.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.230
Sometimes you have to do this to family members,
certain family members.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.230
Vanessa: You have to tune them out.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.640
Dan: But this is definitely considered to
be rude.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.640
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.794
You don't want to show that you're tuning
them out.

00:41:31.794 --> 00:41:34.900
Dan: You don't want to tell people, "I'm tuning
you out."

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.930
If you say that to somebody, that means, "I
am ignoring you.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.650
I am not listening to you.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.020
I'm trying to pretend you're not even here."

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.650
It's very strong, if you're tuning somebody
out.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:46.650
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:50.010
Dan: Or, alternatively, you can tune something
else out.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:56.830
So, a lot of times in modern times we say
this for maybe the news?

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.260
Or maybe Twitter.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.250
You've got to tune out Twitter.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.670
I don't even know why you'd be on Twitter.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.030
I don't have Twitter because it just annoys
me.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:11.780
If you're tuning out the news you're just
... Talking heads just talking about all the

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.050
problems in the world, all the stuff.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.369
There's all these bad things going on, I can't
take it.

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:19.369
No.

00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:22.040
You just have to tune it out and focus on
the good things in life.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.040
Vanessa: Yes.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.310
You'll notice that oftentimes we split this
phrasal verb.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:30.000
In the lesson guide I specify, if you can
split a phrasal verb and then how to do it,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.920
but I'll just mention this briefly here.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.430
We often split tune her out.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.770
Tune it out.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.280
If you're talking about the news, this is
often done.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.410
So, make sure you check out the lesson guide
for some more examples.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:44.810
Vanessa: The next expression and a great phrasal
verb is to wind up.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.970
There are two different meanings for this.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:54.940
The first one ... Well, this is a literal
sense, is to twist something.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.980
You are winding up the clock.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.100
Dan: You're making it tight.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.340
Vanessa: You're making it tight.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.390
So, this also links to the figurative sense.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.000
Vanessa: What is that figurative sense?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.780
If you say, "Oh, I was so wound up after work."

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.780
Dan: Yeah.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.560
It means that you are stressed out.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.020
Usually we mean this in a stressed out way.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.020
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.390
Dan: But it could also be excited.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.030
I'm all wound up for the concert.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:21.240
But, you know, I'd usually say it's probably
associated with stress nowadays.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.360
Vanessa: Yes.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.550
And why are we using wound instead of wind
here?

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:31.890
We're using the past tense, because we only
use wound, "I am wound up," when we're talking

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.970
about that figurative sense.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.450
I feel so wound up, like, a clock, like, a
rope.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:39.450
I'm so tight.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.450
Dan: Yeah.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.450
Vanessa: I feel uncomfortable.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.160
Dan: It's how you feel now and it's something
that happened in the past to make you feel

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160
this way.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.280
So, I am wound up.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.960
But if you say the second meaning of this
phrasal verb, "I was driving down the road,

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.850
and I was following my directions.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.020
I don't know how ... How did I wind up here?"

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.020
Dan: Wow.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.600
Vanessa: What does this mean, the second meaning?

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.710
Dan: This means you end or conclude somewhere.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.710
Vanessa: Surprising.

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.440
Oh, I thought I was following my directions,
but then I ended up here.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.300
That's another phrasal verb.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.060
Ended up means wind up.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.180
How did I wind up here?

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.180
Dan: Yes.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.180
Vanessa: How did I end up here?

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.180
I thought I was following my directions.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.180
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.390
Vanessa: So, it's kind of a surprising place
that you go.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:24.510
Dan: Yeah.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.950
You weren't planning on something happening.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:32.910
If you wind up somewhere ... For example,
maybe you go to college and you are taking

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.120
biology ...
Vanessa: Like Dan!

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.720
Dan: This happened to me.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.460
Well, I started out in biology but I wound
up studying business.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.619
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:45.940
So, when you use it in the past tense, for
this meaning of surprisingly going somewhere.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.510
You can use it in the present.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.510
How did I wind up here?

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:54.570
Or we could say it in the past, "I wound up
here."

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.170
We need to use both of those when we're using
this specific meaning.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:00.110
Vanessa: So, Dan wound up as a business major.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:01.110
How did it happen?

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.210
How did I get here?

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.210
Dan: Yeah.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.260
Vanessa: This is a little bit surprising.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.460
Dan: I went to college and I wound up with
Vanessa.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.520
Vanessa: Wow!

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.530
How did that happen?

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.480
So, it's some kind of surprising conclusion.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.410
Vanessa: So, make sure that you check out
the lesson guide so that you can get both

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.880
of these meanings, and make sure that you
get the grammar correct.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:21.230
Gayle: ...and to not be ... not like, get
too wound up in self criticism.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.960
You know, because you realize like, "Well,
I'm not very strong or ...

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.990
Gayle: ...and to not be ... not like, get
too wound up in self criticism.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.590
You know, because you realize like, "Well,
I'm not very strong or ...

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:35.130
Vanessa: The last phrasal verb that we're
going to talk about today in detail in this

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.430
grammar lesson is to bring up something.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.430
Dan: Yes.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.550
We want to bring up the term bring up.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:41.550
Vanessa: Yes.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:45.830
That is the first way that we are going to
bring it up, and that is to just introduce

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:46.960
something in conversation.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:53.890
For example, in the US we rarely bring up
religion in conversation.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:59.160
This means we rarely talk about the topic
of religion spontaneously with, maybe people

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.310
we don't know that well.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:01.560
Dan: It gets personal.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.560
Right.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560
Yeah.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.150
So, bringing up is definitely the first introduction.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:06.150
Vanessa: Yes.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.150
Dan: Right?

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:10.619
Sometimes if you say, "All of a sudden he
brought up politics ..."

00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:11.619
Vanessa: Oh!

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:12.910
Dan: Or he brought up religion ...
Vanessa: Oh!

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:13.910
Dan: It's suddenly.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:14.910
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.350
Dan: So, it often means it's a sudden thing.

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:17.350
Vanessa: Yes.

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:18.350
It's entering into conversation.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:19.619
So, there are two main ways.

00:46:19.619 --> 00:46:23.590
They have the same meaning, but they're two
main things that are often brought up.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:24.590
One is topics.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.150
It is spontaneously entered into conversation.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:33.660
Or what if you look at a picture of your childhood,
and you see your brothers there, you see your

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.880
friends from across the street are there,
and you're playing with your favorite soccer

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880
ball?

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.750
It kind of brings up some warm feelings inside
of you.

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.410
Dan: Perhaps it brings up some nostalgia.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:46.520
Vanessa: Oh, nostalgia.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520
Dan: Nostalgia.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.400
Vanessa: That warm feeling from your past.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.340
So, it's bringing up some feelings inside
of you.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.340
It is rising.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.650
It's not coming up in conversation.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.250
But it's just coming up within you.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.250
Dan: Yeah.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.090
It could just be internal in the feelings,
the emotions.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.090
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:08.800
So, when you think back on our time, let's
say our time when we first were married and

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.050
we lived in Pennsylvania.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:11.770
What does that bring up within you?

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.440
Dan: What feelings does it bring up?

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.440
Vanessa: Yes.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.340
Dan: It brings up a sense of ... It's good
memories, I'd say.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.510
But overall, I'm glad we're not there.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.900
Mostly because we lived in a very cold house.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.620
Vanessa: There are no heat in Pennsylvania.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.880
Dan: We were very, very poor.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.920
Vanessa: And very busy all the time.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.840
Dan: Living off of a Starbucks salary.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.910
Vanessa: We were really busy.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:38.390
I think we had four jobs, and no heat in our
house.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.670
So, when I think about our first year married,
it brings up a lot of mixed feelings.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:44.670
Dan: Mixed emotions.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:48.340
Vanessa: It was a special time because we
were first married, but also we were really

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.340
busy.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.360
So, it was quite difficult.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.490
It brought up some mixed feelings inside of
me.

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:56.170
Or maybe when you're thinking back on a difficult
time.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.590
"Oh, it brought up some sad feelings."

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.430
Or it brought up some excitement from my past.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.440
It brought up some warm memories.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.570
Dan: Yes.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:09.849
Going back to the first meaning, you can also
split the phrasal verb up.

00:48:09.849 --> 00:48:11.390
So, you could say, "bring it up."

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.560
Or bring ...
Vanessa: Bringing a topic up.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.210
Dan: Bring blank up.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:16.210
Right.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.890
So, a lot of times as people are having an
argument, they might say, "Why did you bring

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:22.550
it up," or, "Why did you bring that up?"

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:23.550
Vanessa: Something from the past.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:24.550
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:27.530
Vanessa: It's not a good idea to bring up
stuff from the past.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.530
Don't bring it up.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.630
Don't bring it up now.

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:30.630
Someone might say that in an argument.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.630
"Don't bring it up now."

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.630
Dan: Right.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:33.630
Vanessa: Don't talk about that now.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.630
Dan: That would mean don't talk about it.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.630
Don't speak of it.

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:36.630
Vanessa: Yes, yes.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:42.340
So, there is one main meaning to arise with
bring up, but it could be topics in conversation,

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.220
or it could be feelings within yourself.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.880
Vanessa: So, let's watch the clip so you can
see how it was used.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.960
Gayle: ... you might discover something in
a yoga class that was brought up, and then

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.160
you can ...
Gayle: ... you might discover something in

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.100
a yoga class that was brought up, and then
you can ...

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.210
Vanessa: Were those phrasal verbs new to you?

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.450
I hope that you learned something new about
using them in your life.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:03.450
Vanessa: Alright.

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:05.990
Now we're going to go on to the pronunciation
lesson.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:11.770
This is where we take an in-depth look at
some of the vocabulary expression sentences,

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:14.580
and try to say them as naturally as possible.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.060
I want you to try to repeat after me.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.060
Speak out loud.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.720
Try to really follow my prompts, so that you
can speak naturally.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720
Vanessa: Let's go.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.250
Vanessa: What we're going to be doing is breaking
down each sentence.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:31.109
I'll show you the clip from the conversation,
we'll break it down in detail, you'll have

00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:32.690
a chance to repeat with me.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:34.680
Please be active during this lesson.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.020
Please repeat with me.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.790
Try to speak out loud as much as you can.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.380
When I pause, make sure that you fill in the
blanks.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.060
I'll be giving you some instruction so that
you can follow along.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:48.720
Then we'll watch the clip again, so that you
can hear every little thing that we talked

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.720
about.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.200
Vanessa: I'm sure that this will be useful
to you now as you improve, and also as you

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.910
go into the real world and have real conversations.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:56.910
Vanessa: Alright.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.750
Let's get started with the first clip.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.720
We're going to listen to the first sentence
from the conversation with Gayle.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.720
Gayle: Yeah.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.230
Although, you know, everything kind of ... It's
a lot about your vision and being mindful

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.420
and exploring.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.910
And so, they kind of weave together in some
ways.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:14.450
Gayle: It's a lot about your vision and being
mindful ...

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:18.170
Gayle: It's a lot about your vision and being
mindful ...

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.440
Vanessa: Did you hear the vocabulary word,
vision?

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.440
Vision?

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.740
We're going to be talking about this word,
and also the rest of this short sentence.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.010
It's a lot about your vision.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:31.170
It's a lot about your vision.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:34.500
It's a lot about your vision.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.290
Vanessa: Let's start at the beginning.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:40.070
Can you say with me, "It's."

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.070
It's.

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:47.230
Then we're going onto this next word, but
it's actually two words together, a lot.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.230
A lot.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.030
Vanessa: Do you hear a lot?

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:55.350
Really, this is something that's reoccurring
in American English, that that final T is

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.350
stopped.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:57.780
Your tongue is at the top of your mouth.

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.880
You're going to make that T sound but you
don't.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.400
Instead it just gets cut short.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.920
Your tongue stops at the top of your mouth.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.410
Vanessa: So, can you say that with me?

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.850
A lot.

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.200
Is your tongue on the top of your mouth?

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.200
I hope so.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.470
A lot.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:12.470
A lot.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:13.960
Don't let air pass through.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.880
Don't say a lot.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.150
Instead just let it stop there.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.150
A lot.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:19.770
Vanessa: Let's put those two words together.

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:21.150
It's a lot.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:22.670
It's a lot.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:23.670
It's a lot.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:24.670
Okay.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:25.670
Let's go onto the next word.

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.410
Vanessa: The next word is about.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.830
About.

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.180
Do you hear something similar happening here?

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.020
That final T gets cut short.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:35.950
Your tongue is at the top of your mouth, but
there's no air going through.

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.190
Say it with me.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:38.190
About.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.190
About.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:41.250
Let's say the full sentence up to this point.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:45.369
Vanessa: It's a lot about.

00:51:45.369 --> 00:51:46.720
It's a lot about.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:54.620
Vanessa: The next word is your, but those
two vowels in the middle, O, U, instead they

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.930
change and become E. Your.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.090
Your.

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:01.040
This happens when native speakers are talking
quickly.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.500
So, I want you to be able to imitate this
and use it yourself.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.790
Vanessa: Your.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.790
Your.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.790
Your.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.040
Can you say that with me?

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040
Your.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.170
Let's go and say the full sentence to this
point.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:16.750
Vanessa: It's a lot about your.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:19.100
It's a lot about your.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.349
It's a lot about your.

00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:23.250
Vanessa: The final word is our key word here.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.250
Vision.

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:25.250
Vision.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:28.940
There's a lot of vibrations that are happening
in this word.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.349
First with the letter V.

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:40.080
There should be some vibrations here, happening
with your lips.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:47.680
That final sound is in.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.680
In.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.510
Just like I'm in my house, in.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:52.510
Vision.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:53.510
Vision.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:54.510
Vision.

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:57.099
Those vowels are the same.

00:52:57.099 --> 00:52:58.890
They're both short Is.

00:52:58.890 --> 00:52:59.920
Vision.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.950
Vision.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:01.980
Vision.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.010
Vision.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:04.590
Can you say that with me?

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:05.590
Vision.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:06.590
What's your vision?

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:07.590
Vision.

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:10.630
Vanessa: Let's go back and try to say this
full sentence all together, and then I'm going

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.410
to pause so that you can say it by yourself?

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:13.410
Ready?

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:17.410
Vanessa: It's a lot about your vision.

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:19.460
It's a lot about your vision.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.320
It's a lot about your vision.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.859
It's a lot about your vision.

00:53:23.859 --> 00:53:25.359
It's a lot about your vision.

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:26.359
It's a lot about your vision.

00:53:26.359 --> 00:53:27.359
Vanessa: Alright.

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:28.359
I'm going to pause.

00:53:28.359 --> 00:53:29.359
I want you to say it by yourself.

00:53:29.359 --> 00:53:30.800
Go ahead.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.470
Vanessa: Great work!

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:34.470
Alright.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.400
Let's listen to the clip so that you can hear
Gayle say the sentence.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.770
Gayle: It's a lot about your vision and being
mindful ...

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:44.880
Gayle: It's a lot about your vision and ...
Gayle: It's a lot about your vision and ...

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.840
Vanessa: The second sentence that we're going
to practice shadowing features the expression

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.180
it takes a toll.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.180
It takes a toll.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.400
If you've already studied the vocabulary expression
you understand what this means.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.600
Let's watch the clip where I said this, and
then we're going to repeat it together.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.200
Gayle: I had never sat so much in my whole
life.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.940
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:02.940
Gayle: Oh!

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:03.940
I knew it was.

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.060
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.570
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.840
Vanessa: I said, "It takes a toll on you."

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.670
I said this quite quickly in the conversation.

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:13.790
It takes a toll on you.

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:14.990
It takes a toll on you.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:16.560
So, let's practice this together.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.480
Vanessa: The first two words together have
something unique happening, but we've already

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.480
talked about this.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.730
So, I hope that it will just refresh your
memory.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:25.270
Vanessa: It takes.

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:28.090
The word, it.

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:33.570
That final T. The same thing is going to happen,
what we talked about the T stopping short

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.050
on the top of your mouth.

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:36.050
It.

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:37.050
It.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:38.200
We didn't say it.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:44.550
But the tricky thing here is the next word
starts with a T. So, it kind of sounds like

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.040
one word.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.040
It takes.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.600
It takes.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.270
Just imagine putting a short I before the
word takes.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:53.690
It takes.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:54.920
It takes.

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.350
You don't need to say it takes.

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.760
We don't need to two Ts.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.070
Instead there's just one T and these words
are linked together.

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:04.820
Vanessa: This is going to help you speak quicker
and link those naturally.

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:05.820
It takes.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820
It takes.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.820
Can you say that with me?

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.820
It takes.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:09.820
It takes.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.820
It takes.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.400
Vanessa: In the final part of this sentence
we have three different O sounds.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.640
So, we're going to practice that together.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.090
Get your lips ready.

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:19.050
We're going to practice these three different
Os.

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:26.180
They are it takes a toll on you.

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.460
Let's start with that first word.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.460
Vanessa: Toll.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.460
Toll.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:30.460
Toll.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.359
Can you make your lips look mine?

00:55:32.359 --> 00:55:35.400
If you have a little mirror try to look at
your lips in that mirror so that you can see

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.680
if they're imitating me.

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.680
Toll.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.680
Toll.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.850
Vanessa: Then the next one is a little bit
longer.

00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:41.850
On.

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:42.850
Toll on.

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:43.850
Toll on.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:52.320
Vanessa: The final one, we're going to kind
of pucker our lips a little bit like a kiss.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.320
You.

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.320
You.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.570
Toll on you.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.240
Toll on you.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.850
So, it's starting small then tall, and then
puckered together.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:04.730
Toll on you.

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:06.790
Vanessa: Can you say that with me?

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:08.859
Toll on you.

00:56:08.859 --> 00:56:12.050
Make sure that you kind of exaggerate your
mouth like I'm doing.

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:15.010
Then we're going to say it faster, and it's
going to be a little bit less exaggerated.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:18.910
You're not going to see in the conversation
my lips saying toll on you.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.089
It's not going to be quite so clear.

00:56:21.089 --> 00:56:24.960
But when we say it we're going to be using
that same pronunciation, just a little bit

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:25.960
subtler.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.720
Vanessa: So, let's go ahead and say it together.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.770
Toll on you.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.160
Toll on you.

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.160
Toll on you.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.760
Can you say that with me?

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.859
Toll on you.

00:56:34.859 --> 00:56:35.859
Toll on you.

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.720
Let's say it faster.

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.940
Toll on you.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:39.940
Toll on you.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:40.980
Toll on you.

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.250
Vanessa: Alright.

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:44.810
Let's piece the sentence all together.

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:49.290
It takes a toll on you.

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:52.480
It takes a toll on you.

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.480
It takes a toll on you.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.290
It takes a toll on you.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:56.760
It takes a toll on you.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.170
It takes a toll on you.

00:56:58.170 --> 00:56:59.290
Vanessa: Are you saying that with me?

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:00.290
Say it with me.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.540
It takes a toll on you.

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.520
It takes a toll on you.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.520
Alright.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.480
Then a pause, and it's your tune.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.290
Go ahead.

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:10.109
Vanessa: Excellent.

00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:13.220
I hope that this practice doesn't take a toll
on you.

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.430
I hope that it's helpful to you instead.

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:16.430
Let's watch the clip.

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:17.560
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.160
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.849
Vanessa: It takes a toll on you.

00:57:20.849 --> 00:57:24.609
Vanessa: The next sentence that we're going
to practice includes the vocabulary expression,

00:57:24.609 --> 00:57:26.869
down the road.

00:57:26.869 --> 00:57:27.869
Down the road.

00:57:27.869 --> 00:57:28.869
Let's listen to that clip.

00:57:28.869 --> 00:57:33.510
Gayle: You think about all this negativity
and don't realize like, that has a lot of

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:34.869
implications down the road.

00:57:34.869 --> 00:57:37.280
Gayle: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.660
Gayle: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:43.820
Vanessa: Gayle says, "That has a lot of implications
down the road."

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:46.099
That has a lot of implications down the road.

00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:47.810
Let's break down the sentence starting with
the beginning.

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:50.619
Vanessa: The first word is that.

00:57:50.619 --> 00:57:52.190
Do you notice that final T here?

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:53.360
I hope that you do.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:57.210
I hope that you can say this now naturally
with me, your tongue at the top of your mouth,

00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:58.210
stopping.

00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.210
That.

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:00.210
That.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.210
That.

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:02.210
Are you saying it with me?

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:03.210
That.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.840
Vanessa: Has a lot.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.840
Has a lot.

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.840
Has.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.660
Here we have a Z sound.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.390
Has a lot.

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:14.980
Ooh, we have another T that's cut out.

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.240
Same word as before.

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.430
Has a lot.

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:19.839
That has a lot.

00:58:19.839 --> 00:58:21.080
That has a lot.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.080
That has a lot.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.770
Can you say that with me quickly?

00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:25.010
That has a lot.

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:27.350
That has a lot.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:28.359
That has a lot.

00:58:28.359 --> 00:58:32.520
Vanessa: Next let's try to tackle this beautiful
word, implications.

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.520
Let's break it down.

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.440
Try to say it with me as I say it.

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.320
Implications.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.200
Implications.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:46.470
There needs to be a short I in the middle.

00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:49.339
Impli ... That's the short I. Implications.

00:58:49.339 --> 00:58:50.500
Implications.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.650
Implications.

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:52.810
Implications.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:58.630
Vanessa: Let's say the full sentence up to
this point.

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:03.820
That has a lot of implications.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.240
That has a lot of implications.

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.270
Say it with me.

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:08.670
That has a lot of implications.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.109
That has a lot of implications.

00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:12.360
Are your mouth muscles warmed up?

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.360
I hope so.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.360
Vanessa: Let's go to the final part.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:19.570
Our key expression, down the road, has one
special element we're going to focus on.

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:22.000
It's the final letter.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.510
Road.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:28.570
Something happens with that D sound that we've
already talked about with the T. It isn't

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:29.770
really pronounced.

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:34.840
Your mouth is in the position to say it, but
there's really no air that comes out.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:38.700
Vanessa: So, let's practice saying road.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:42.020
Not road, but road.

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:47.930
Your tongue is there in place, about to make
the D sound, but there's no vibration and

00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:49.320
air that comes out.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.810
Let's say that expression.

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.010
Down the road.

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:53.270
Down the road.

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:55.260
Down the road.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.260
Down the road.

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.380
Vanessa: Of course, you can say down the road.

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.900
It's fine to add the D. But here in the conversation
we didn't add it, so I want to make sure that

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.930
you can really imitate exactly the way that
we're pronouncing, because once you learn

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:11.420
to break down sentences like this, you can
also do it on your own.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.859
You can listen carefully to a short clip,
like, one sentence, like we're doing now,

01:00:15.859 --> 01:00:17.060
and practice this yourself.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:21.720
Vanessa: If you hear something in the conversation
and you wonder, "Why could I not understand

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.430
that," you can break it down piece by piece
like this.

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:28.950
I hope I'm giving you some general tools to
help practice your pronunciation yourself.

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:31.110
Vanessa: So, let's say this full sentence
together.

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:32.480
Don't forget the word implications.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.240
Don't forget cutting off Ts, and then that
final word, road.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.990
Vanessa: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.260
Make sure that your flow is natural.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.760
Follow my hands.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:51.599
That has a lot of implications down the road.

01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:52.599
Like a wave.

01:00:52.599 --> 01:00:56.710
That has a lot of implications down the road.

01:00:56.710 --> 01:01:00.060
That has a lot of implications down the road.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.300
Can you say that with me?

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.900
That has a lot of implications down the road.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.710
That has a lot of implications down the road.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:07.710
Vanessa: Alright.

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:12.180
I'm going to pause, and I want you to say
this wonderful sentence yourself.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.370
Go ahead.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.060
Vanessa: Great work.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.060
Alright.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.060
Let's watch the clip again.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.800
Gayle: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.200
Gayle: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.470
Gayle: That has a lot of implications down
the road.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:27.530
Vanessa: Are your pronunciation muscles warmed
up?

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:34.270
Along with the conversation, vocabulary, grammar,
and pronunciation lessons in the Fearless

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:39.210
Fluency Club, you'll also get access to the
MP3 versions of all of these lessons, and

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:43.770
full PDF transcripts so that you can follow
along with each word, because I know there

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:47.280
are a lot of new things that you can learn
with really every sentence.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.290
Vanessa: You'll also be able to study with
the story.

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.540
Let's take a look at that really quick.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:57.310
Vanessa: The story is a fun, one page combination
of all of the things that you learned this

01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:58.310
month.

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:02.339
You'll see the vocabulary expressions, the
phrasal verbs, the idioms, everything that

01:02:02.339 --> 01:02:06.860
you have learned is combined into this short
story that you can repeat and listen to, and

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.000
say out loud, and even memorize if you want.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.510
Vanessa: I also host live lessons in our private
Facebook group so that we can interact with

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.700
this material every week, and also so that
you can meet each other.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:22.920
A lot of members like to talk together, and
I think it's a good way to increase and improve

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.359
your vocabulary, and just improve your speaking
skills.

01:02:25.359 --> 01:02:27.211
Vanessa: So, now I have a question for you.

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.510
Have you ever done yoga before?

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:34.320
If you join the Fearless Fluency Club in the
month of April, which is this month, April

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.250
2019, you'll also see a short clip of Gayle
teaching me some yoga poses.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:43.160
It's kind of embarrassing because I usually
don't do this for my English lessons.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.349
But it was fun, and it was a good chance for
you to be able to see Gayle's teaching style.

01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:49.470
But I want to know, have you ever done yoga?

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:51.810
Let me know in the comments.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:56.109
I'll see you again next Friday, here on my
YouTube channel, for another video.

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:58.490
Vanessa: Thanks so much for learning English
with me.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:59.490
Bye!

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:04.400
Vanessa: The next step is to download my free
E-book, Five Steps To Becoming A Confident

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.900
English Speaker.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:09.940
You'll learn what you need to do to speak
confidently and fluently.

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:13.490
Don't forget to subscribe to me YouTube channel
for more free lessons.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.890
Vanessa: Thanks so much.

01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:15.240
Bye!
