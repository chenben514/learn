Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:10.160
SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Are you ready to have&nbsp;
amazing English conversations? Yes, let's do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.280
Imagine this. You're at a party where you don't&nbsp;
know anyone. Everyone's having conversations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.720
in English, but you don't feel super comfortable&nbsp;
speaking with just anyone in English yet. Someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.120
walks up to you, smiles, introduces themselves,&nbsp;
and start speaking with you in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.400
They're friendly and seem genuinely interested in&nbsp;
what you have to say. Before you know it, you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.560
having a comfortable conversation in English. You&nbsp;
may not be saying everything perfectly, but your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.080
new friend is encouraging you and you're saying&nbsp;
things that you didn't even know that you knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.600
how to say. You leave the party feeling happy and&nbsp;
confident and proud of yourself for having such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.320
an amazing conversation. If you had not gone to&nbsp;
that party, or if you had hidden in the bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.480
you would have missed out on such an amazing time.
There's a famous quote by Maya Angelou, and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.560
says, "I've learned that people will forget&nbsp;
what you said, people will forget what you did,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.520
but people will never forget how you made them&nbsp;
feel." This is great news because you don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.040
to have perfect grammar, perfect vocabulary,&nbsp;
perfect pronunciation when you speak. When you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.880
make other people feel good, you are automatically&nbsp;
great at having amazing conversations. Today, I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.320
going to teach you four tips and several phrases&nbsp;
so that you can make other people feel awesome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.000
while you're speaking with them, which also&nbsp;
grows your confidence in speaking in English.&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.840
Tip number one for amazing conversations, is to&nbsp;
compliment other people. This doesn't mean that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.360
you tell everyone, "You're so beautiful. You're&nbsp;
handsome. Your hair is amazing. Your eyes are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.520
great." No, this doesn't mean that you are&nbsp;
complementing their physical appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.280
This means that you are showing genuine interest&nbsp;
in what other people have to say. A way that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.880
can show other people that you're interested in&nbsp;
what they have to say, and you're saying, "Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.400
what you're saying is interesting. I want&nbsp;
to hear more about that," is by using some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.600
positive interjections in conversations.&nbsp;
Advanced English speakers use these all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.080
time and you should too. I want to teach you some&nbsp;
of these positive interjections that you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.520
that tell the other person, "Hey, you're awesome.&nbsp;
I want to hear more about what you have to say."&nbsp;

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.800
I'm going to say each positive interjection&nbsp;
two times. The first time I want you to listen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.680
and the second time I want you to say it&nbsp;
out loud. Imagine that you're at that party,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.080
talking with someone else who you want to&nbsp;
become friends with, who you're interested in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.320
and you want to show them, I'm interested in&nbsp;
you. How can you compliment them with your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.640
ears? Listening to them with these interjections.&nbsp;
Let's give it a try. Wow, that's so cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:24.720
Say it with me. Wow, that's so cool. That's&nbsp;
great. That's great. I love that. I love that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:34.080
No way, that's awesome. No way, that's awesome.&nbsp;
Oh my gosh, how fun is that? Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:44.240
how fun is that? Oh, really? Oh, really? For real,&nbsp;
that's too funny. For real, that's too funny.&nbsp;

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.120
Can you get the sense from all of these positive&nbsp;
interjections that you're making that other person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.760
feel like I'm saying something that that person&nbsp;
really cares about. When they say, "For real,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.480
that's too funny." It shows you're listening. It&nbsp;
shows that you think they're funny and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.120
going to feel so good about themselves.&nbsp;
You are complementing what they're saying.&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.520
My second tip for having amazing conversations is&nbsp;
to have a mindset shift. I want you to shift your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.880
mindset into thinking that every person you speak&nbsp;
with has something interesting to say, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.920
can't wait to find out what that is. Be interested&nbsp;
in other people. If you only speak about yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.000
you're not a great conversationalist. If someone&nbsp;
says that their car broke down and you immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.680
say, "Oh yeah, my car broke down last week too."&nbsp;
How do you think that makes that other person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.400
feel? Makes them feel like, did you even hear what&nbsp;
I said? Do you care about me, that my car broke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.240
down? Take a step back and to be interested&nbsp;
in their story, be interested in their life.&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.280
Have you ever been telling someone something that&nbsp;
you are really excited about? Maybe you said, "Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.120
I just interviewed for a new job last week&nbsp;
at Google." And then the other person says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.880
"Oh yeah, I thought about interviewing for&nbsp;
there too." Well, how does that make you feel?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.160
Feels like they're not willing to share your&nbsp;
excitement because they only want to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.440
about themselves. "Oh yeah. I interviewed&nbsp;
there too." Well, you don't want to be that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.320
kind of person. You want to take interest&nbsp;
in what other people have to say and think,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.520
well, other people have something that I am&nbsp;
curious about and I can't wait to learn more.&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.200
I'd like to give you some phrases&nbsp;
that you can use to show that you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.640
genuinely interested in what other people have to&nbsp;
say. Like before, I'm going to say them two times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.840
first time you can listen, and the second time say&nbsp;
it with me. Speak out loud. How did that happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.040
How did that happen? What was that like? What&nbsp;
was that like? What do you think will happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.080
What do you think will happen? What made you want&nbsp;
to do that? What made you want to do that? Have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.240
you always been interested in that? Have you&nbsp;
always been interested in that? Great, these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.760
phrases show that you are genuinely interested in&nbsp;
what the other person has to say. Great. You're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.720
on your way to having amazing conversations.
Tip number three for having amazing conversations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:28.000
is to listen actively. Listen actively, but&nbsp;
listening is usually a passive thing, you're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.400
taking in input. But really active listening means&nbsp;
that you are either guessing the emotion of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.480
other person or you're mirroring their words. This&nbsp;
is actually excellent for learning English because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.640
you're taking their words and you're restating&nbsp;
it so you might be growing some new vocabulary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.520
growing some new grammar based on what the other&nbsp;
person said. Let me give you a couple examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:02.160
If you work in customer service and someone calls&nbsp;
your customer service line and says, "This product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.280
broke, I can't believe it." You might say,&nbsp;
"Oh, I'm sorry. You must be really frustrated."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.080
But they say, "No, I'm just disappointed&nbsp;
because I thought that it would work."&nbsp;

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.120
Well. What word did they use that you didn't&nbsp;
use? You said, "You must be frustrated," and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.880
they said, "No, I'm just disappointed."&nbsp;
Great chance for active listening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.960
You can say, "I'm sorry that you're so&nbsp;
disappointed. Let me do what I can to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:38.880
make it right." You're mirroring their word and it&nbsp;
makes them feel heard. You're actively listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.360
to the words that they're using and you're able&nbsp;
to use it yourself to reflect their feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.280
This is a great type of listening and phrasing&nbsp;
to use. When someone's telling you something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.240
there's a lot of emotion behind, it could be&nbsp;
positive emotion, it could be something they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.520
worried or fearful about, this type of negative&nbsp;
emotion. Here are some sample phrases that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:08.000
can use so that you show that you're listening&nbsp;
actively to someone else. That other person feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.960
good that you really heard what they had to say.
You can say, "You must be feeling," and then add&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.840
some kind of emotion. You must be feeling&nbsp;
really excited about that job interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.320
You must be feeling really nervous to approach&nbsp;
your boss. You must be feeling really upset that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.000
that happened. Oh, well maybe they didn't&nbsp;
say specifically excited, worried, upset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.120
but you are guessing their emotion. Maybe they'll&nbsp;
correct you and say, "Ah, actually I just feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.120
hesitant. I feel really disappointed." Okay.&nbsp;
That's all right. You can mirror that back. "Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.160
That's so disappointing." But when you are trying&nbsp;
to actively listen and pull out their emotion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.520
excellent, you are a wonderful conversationalist.
Let me give you some phrases. That must be really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:05.840
nerve wracking. That must be really exciting.&nbsp;
That must be really awful. That must be... Can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.640
you practice that with me? That must be really&nbsp;
wracking. That must be really exciting. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:19.920
must be really awful. Our final phrase for active&nbsp;
listening is, that sounds really nerve wracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:29.040
That sounds really exciting. That sounds really&nbsp;
awful. Here you're trying to pull that emotion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.240
out of it and connect with the other person.&nbsp;
Can you say that with me? That sounds really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:40.800
nerve wracking. That sounds really exciting.&nbsp;
Oh, that sounds really awful. Excellent work.&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.920
A little bonus tip, this works very well with&nbsp;
children. If you have young kids, I guess any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.440
kids, if you work with kids, you see kids, you&nbsp;
know that kids exist. I recommend this book, How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.880
To Talk So Kids Will Listen, How To Listen So Kids&nbsp;
Will Talk. They also have a teenage version as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.600
well, I think. It's a great way to be able to use&nbsp;
active listening at an age appropriate level so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:12.160
that your kids feel heard. Also so that your kids&nbsp;
hear you and hear you in the way that you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.600
them to hear. Great book, great recommendation.
Okay. Let's go to our fourth and final tip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:25.920
for amazing English conversations. Tip number four&nbsp;
for amazing conversations is body language. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.320
can have all the right words, all the right&nbsp;
things to say, but if your body is like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.040
well, you know what that tells the other person. I&nbsp;
don't really care what you have to say. Yeah. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.040
just kind of bored. So instead as you are&nbsp;
having a conversation with someone else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:55.200
I want you to remember NOSE. Your nose? No.&nbsp;
Instead, this is an acronym, N-O-S-E. We'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.160
talk about it in just a second. Remember&nbsp;
NOSE as you are speaking with someone else.&nbsp;

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:07.200
N is nodding. Nodding. If you're speaking and&nbsp;
someone just stands there and doesn't move,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.720
it seems a little robotic, a little bit like&nbsp;
they're not listening or they don't care.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.880
Makes you feel a little uncomfortable. So if&nbsp;
you just nod while someone else is speaking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.040
oh, it shows that you're listening. It doesn't&nbsp;
mean you always agree with them, but it shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:31.040
that you're listening. You're nodding. What&nbsp;
about O? O is for open posture. Which one feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:38.240
better to you? Me with my arms crossed maybe&nbsp;
turned away from you or me with my arms down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:45.360
and just listening to you? When your body is&nbsp;
open, you don't need to be very open or like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.080
Instead, just having an open posture, your&nbsp;
shoulders back, and you're facing someone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:00.640
This shows that care and that you're listening.
The S of NOSE is smile. Did you know that our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.320
brains can tell if a smile is real&nbsp;
or not? When you smile like this?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:15.440
Yes, my mouth is making a smiling face, but it's&nbsp;
not real. Could you tell? Could you tell that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:22.480
wasn't really smiling? I was just fake smiling.&nbsp;
Well, the reason why we can tell is because my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:29.760
eyes are not doing anything. A real smile goes&nbsp;
all the way up to your eyes. If I smile like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.440
do you see how my eyes are crinkling a little&nbsp;
bit, maybe even completely crinkling. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.200
means that it is a real smile, that we are really&nbsp;
interested. So as someone is speaking, you can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.080
completely, really interested in what they have&nbsp;
to say. Not just, it feels like a robot, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.880
But when you're really interested in what someone&nbsp;
has to say, oh, yeah, your eyes crinkle a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:09.520
bit and you smile all the way up to your eyes.
The final E of NOSE is eye contact. In English,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:17.200
in the US it is common and important to maintain&nbsp;
eye contact with someone when you're speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.680
You don't need to stare at them the whole time&nbsp;
and never look away. But if you avoid eye contact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.960
as someone's speaking, it makes them feel like&nbsp;
you don't want to be there, you don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:35.360
talk with them. So instead, if you look them in&nbsp;
the eyes and you smile and you nod and you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.000
open posture, you are a welcoming and inviting&nbsp;
person who anyone would want to speak with.&nbsp;

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.840
So maintain some eye contact. Maybe if that's&nbsp;
tough for you, you can focus here or focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.000
one eye over the other. You don't need to stress&nbsp;
yourself out too much, but having that kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.560
nodding, genuine smile, open posture and&nbsp;
maintaining eye contact, that is a great way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.920
to have excellent conversations. Well, now,&nbsp;
when you compliment others, having mindset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.480
shift that other people have interesting things&nbsp;
to say, and you listen actively and have great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.880
body language, well, congratulations, you&nbsp;
have the power to have amazing conversations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.240
great relationships and confidence in&nbsp;

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:03.840
you a little scenario. Imagine that I told you,&nbsp;
"I can't wait, I get to see my grandma next week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:11.360
for the first time in a year." What would you say&nbsp;
to me? Can you use any of these phrases, maybe an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.760
active listening phrase, you must be feeling&nbsp;
or one of the other phrases so that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.440
be a great conversationalist? Let me know in the&nbsp;
comments how you would respond to me. If I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.800
"I get to see my grandma next week after a&nbsp;
full year of not seeing her." Let me know in&nbsp;&nbsp;
