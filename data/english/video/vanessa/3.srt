00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.720
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.560
Are you ready to practice speaking&nbsp;
English today? Let's do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.760
Hey, whaâ€™tch up to this&nbsp;
weekend? Yes? What do you say?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:30.400
If I asked you, Hey, whatch up to this weekend?&nbsp;
Would you freeze and panic, because you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.680
know how to respond to this question easily and&nbsp;
naturally? Never fear. Today I'm going to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.600
you to naturally have a conversation about&nbsp;
your weekend plans which is a really common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.040
conversation topic. Maybe you're leaving school&nbsp;
or work on a Friday and someone asks you, "Hey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.040
whatch up to this weekend?" And they ask you&nbsp;
about your weekend plans, instead of freezing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.000
and panicking, today I want to help you learn&nbsp;
the most important conversation question that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.640
you can use in these situations. Also some common&nbsp;
vocabulary for talking about your weekend plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.240
And then at the end of this lesson, we're going&nbsp;
to practice a little exchange back and forth.&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.560
I hope that you can get your pronunciation and&nbsp;
speaking muscles ready so you can really use what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.920
you've learned during today's lesson. Are you&nbsp;
ready to learn the most important conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.440
question of all time, at least according to&nbsp;
me? Is that question, what's your name? No.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.880
Is that question, will you give me money? No. Is&nbsp;
that question, do you love me? No, no, no. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.680
most important conversation question is, there's&nbsp;
actually two parts, what about you? How about you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.160
When someone asks you about your weekend plans&nbsp;
and you say a little reply, I'm going hiking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.400
I'm not doing much, there might be an incredibly&nbsp;
awful awkward pause. What happens next?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.720
Well, this is where the most important question&nbsp;
comes in. You can ask them, what about you? How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.760
about you? You can imagine tossing a ball back and&nbsp;
forth. The other person has asked you a question.&nbsp;

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.960
What are you doing this weekend? They throw&nbsp;
you the ball. Now you reply and you say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.800
I'm going hiking, or I'm not doing much. You need&nbsp;
to throw or toss the ball back to that person. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.640
this question does that, how about you? It means&nbsp;
you are asking the same question back to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.400
What are you doing this weekend? How about you?&nbsp;
I want you to remember this wonderful question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.960
either of them, actually, they have&nbsp;
the exact same meaning, how about you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.880
What about you? Remember these questions, because&nbsp;
later when we practice this at the end of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.320
lesson during our conversation speaking time,&nbsp;
remember these questions and use them. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.720
let's go to some common vocabulary that&nbsp;
you can use to talk about weekend plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.720
Brunch, many Americans love brunch.&nbsp;
The word brunch is a combination of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.560
breakfast and lunch. And that's because we usually&nbsp;
eat this on the weekends, maybe a Saturday morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.000
or a Sunday morning between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM.
It's a time when you could eat either breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.360
or lunch, and it's usually a long social event.&nbsp;
So you might go out to brunch with your friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.760
or have your friends to your house to eat&nbsp;
brunch. My friends and I are meeting at our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.960
favorite brunch spot on Sunday. Great. It's&nbsp;
a restaurant where you can eat breakfast type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.840
foods. Usually with some kind of alcoholic drink&nbsp;
like a mimosa or something with fruit in it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.800
or maybe some champagne in the morning. And you&nbsp;
can eat this in the company of your friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.440
Another common weekend word is social butterfly.&nbsp;
A social butterfly refers to someone who makes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.200
lot of plans. They are flying around to event, to&nbsp;
another event, to another activity. They're always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.600
doing things usually involving lots of other&nbsp;
people. They are a social butterfly. If you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.960
a social butterfly, probably the year 2020 with&nbsp;
lockdowns and all of these things were probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.680
really difficult for you, because you love to get&nbsp;
together with other people and always be active.&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.560
So we can use this in a sentence like&nbsp;
this. My friend is a social butterfly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.720
She has invitations to three brunches&nbsp;
and four afternoon teas. Amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.720
What if you are not a social butterfly. What&nbsp;
if you are the opposite? Are you unsocial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:12.880
caterpillar? No. It means you are a homebody.&nbsp;
Your body likes to stay at home. I'm a homebody.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.960
She's a homebody. Someone who enjoys just doing&nbsp;
things slowly and staying at home. They feel most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.440
comfortable in a comfortable place at home. You&nbsp;
could say, "My friend is a social butterfly, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.560
I'm more of a homebody. When I get together with&nbsp;
friends, I would rather have dinner at my house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.080
and then play games here." I think this is true&nbsp;
for me personally, as I get a little bit older&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.800
I prefer these intimate group&nbsp;
settings. Instead of lots of people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.960
I prefer just a couple of friends at home.
Maybe having a bonfire outside, roasting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.920
some food or some marshmallows and this kind of&nbsp;
intimate setting. I enjoy doing activities at home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.880
more often than when I was a little bit younger.&nbsp;
To stay in, unfortunately that has been probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.560
a lot of our weekend plans for the past year. And&nbsp;
it means that you're just going to stay at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.200
It doesn't mean you're going to do nothing.&nbsp;
It just means you're not going to go anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.720
I'm going to stay in. You might say, "It's&nbsp;
supposed to be cold and rainy this weekend, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.440
I'm just going to stay in and read a book," or&nbsp;
"I'm just going to stay in and do some things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:38.240
around the house." To binge watch. This means that&nbsp;
you watch a lot of movies or TV shows usually back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.960
to back without stopping. So several hours, maybe&nbsp;
you watch four seasons of a TV show in one day.&nbsp;

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:56.480
This is binge watching. You are watching a lot.&nbsp;
This expression comes from a term we usually use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.280
with alcohol. To binge drink, this means&nbsp;
that you drink a lot of alcohol at one time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.400
not a very healthy thing to do. But when we&nbsp;
say to binge drink, that has that same idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.200
is you're doing a lot back to back. Or you could&nbsp;
binge watch TV. So you might say, "Last weekend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.800
my husband and I binge watched all of the Star&nbsp;
Wars movies." This isn't true. When you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.280
young children, you do not have time to binge&nbsp;
watch TV. But you might say this about your life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.360
"I binge watched that new TV show that just&nbsp;
came out." Our final expression that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.880
use to talk about your weekend plans is, to&nbsp;
catch up on some chores. This phrasal verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.080
to catch up on, is a beautiful phrasal verb that&nbsp;
you can use to talk about some kind of necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.800
activity that you haven't done for a while.
And now there's more and more and more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:06.160
and you need to finish all of this. So we can&nbsp;
imagine laundry, dishes, sweeping, cleaning, maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:13.840
some home repairs, tidying up, maybe even yard&nbsp;
work. If you don't do those things for one week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:20.800
or two weeks, Oh, there's so many you have to do.&nbsp;
So that means you need to catch up. You need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.520
do what you haven't done for a while. You need to&nbsp;
catch up on some chores, and chores are just those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.440
activities that I mentioned, laundry, dishes,&nbsp;
these necessary activities that involve cleaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.920
up, helping to make your home a wonderful place&nbsp;
to live. So maybe this weekend, you just need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.160
catch up on some chores. You might say, "I was&nbsp;
so busy all week and finally I'm going to catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.520
up on some chores this weekend." Maybe not very&nbsp;
fun, but when your house is clean it feels good.&nbsp;

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.960
All right, now that we have some common vocabulary&nbsp;
you can use to talk about your weekend plans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.640
let's talk about some introduction&nbsp;
questions that you might hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.040
and that you can also ask other people.&nbsp;
These have varying levels of reductions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:13.280
fast ways that you will hear them. So I want&nbsp;
to help you understand and recognize what other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.120
people are saying and also be able to use&nbsp;
it. So let's talk about our first question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.600
What are you up to this weekend? What are you up&nbsp;
to this weekend? You might know the expression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.920
what's up. This just means, how are you? So&nbsp;
we're using that same word, up to talk about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.200
what are you doing this weekend? What are&nbsp;
you up to this weekend? But do you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.120
that we usually say it like this? What are&nbsp;
you up to this weekend? So clear. So lovely.&nbsp;

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.600
No. Instead we're going to reduce this a&nbsp;
little bit and then we can reduce it a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.960
more. Let's talk about that first one. What&nbsp;
are you up to? What are you up to? What're.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.400
So here the word, what and are, are creating&nbsp;
a spoken contraction. Usually when we write,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:07.440
we don't write this type of contraction. It's only&nbsp;
in spoken English, but oftentimes be verbs like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.320
are, is, will be contracted with a question&nbsp;
word. Whatda you up to this weekend? Whatda,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.280
whatda you up to? We can reduce this a little&nbsp;
bit further. Whatch up to? Whatch up to?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.760
Whatch up to this weekend? There are a lot of&nbsp;
reductions happening at the beginning. Whatchh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:41.840
what-cha up to. So here we have, what are you,&nbsp;
being reduced to just, whatch, the chh is you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:50.080
And what are has just been smashed&nbsp;
together, and we can say whatch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.920
up to, whatch up to, whatch up to, whatch up to.
This is really fast. If you say this slowly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.480
whatch up to, it sounds really weird. So&nbsp;
we only use this in really fast English.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.000
So if you're going to say this, it needs to&nbsp;
be quickly and reduced and linked together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.160
Most likely you're going to hear this. So I want&nbsp;
to make sure that you can understand when someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.200
says, "Hey, whatch up to this weekend."&nbsp;
Whatch up to this weekend. You can say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.320
"Oh, Vanessa taught me that. I know what that&nbsp;
means. What are you up to this weekend? Yes."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.800
So let's go on to our next expression where we're&nbsp;
going to also reduce this a bit and help you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:37.920
understand it. What have you got going on this&nbsp;
weekend? What have you got going on this weekend?&nbsp;

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.240
These all mean the same thing. What are you doing&nbsp;
this weekend? But you might hear this expression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.680
with the word gut. What have you gut going&nbsp;
on this weekend? When you actually hear this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.640
we don't say it clearly. What have you got going&nbsp;
on this weekend? Wouldn't that be nice though?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.480
Instead, you're going to hear a reduction or a&nbsp;
contraction of the first two words, just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:12.000
we saw with the previous example. What've. So what&nbsp;
and have are going to be pushed together. What've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.160
you gut goin on? That final G in the word going&nbsp;
is going to be cut off and we'll just say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.120
goin. So let's try to say that altogether.&nbsp;
You want to try to say it with me? What've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.520
you gut goin on? What've you gut goin on this&nbsp;
weekend? What've you gut goin on this weekend?&nbsp;

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:40.080
Do you think we can reduce this further? Oh yes.&nbsp;
Whatda ya gut goin on this weekend? Whatda ya gut.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:49.440
Here the beginning of, what have you got, is&nbsp;
just really like you threw it in a mixing bowl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.880
stirred it up and threw it out on a cookie&nbsp;
tray. Well, let's try to break it down so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:01.120
it's not quite so messy and complicated. At&nbsp;
the beginning we have, what have you got?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:14.400
But it sounds like, whatda, whatda, this is, what&nbsp;
have. Whatda ya. Ya is you. Whatda ya gut goin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.440
again, we're going to drop that&nbsp;
G at the end of the word going.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.400
Goin on, whatda ya gut goin on? Whatda. Notice&nbsp;
what's happening at the end of the word, what?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.600
Do you hear a clear, T, Whatda ya, whatda ya.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.920
Nope. That at the end of the word,&nbsp;
what is going to change to a D sound?&nbsp;

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.160
This is really typical of American English,&nbsp;
where a T that's surrounded by vowel sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:48.240
is going to change to a D. It's called a flapped&nbsp;
T and it just rolls off your tongue in a smooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:55.600
way. Whatda ya gut goin on? Can you say it&nbsp;
with me? Whatda ya gut goin on this weekend?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.160
Whatda ya gut goin on this weekend? All right,&nbsp;
let's go to our last question. You doin anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.920
fun this weekend? You doin anything fun this&nbsp;
weekend? What's happening at the beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:14.640
this question? Should there be another word? Yep.&nbsp;
Are you doing anything fun this weekend? Are you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.840
but the word, are it's on vacation. It's just gone&nbsp;
somewhere. So we're going to start this question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.400
with the word you. You doin anything fun this&nbsp;
weekend? It makes the questions seem a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.800
more casual and less like an interrogation,&nbsp;
or you're asking someone out on a date.&nbsp;

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.880
It's just a casual question. You doin anything&nbsp;
fun this weekend? But we can reduce this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:42.640
We're not going to reduce it an awful lot, but we&nbsp;
will hear this reduced a little bit. When we say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:51.600
you doing anything fun. Instead, you're going to&nbsp;
hear it, ya doin. Ya, the word you is reduced to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:59.680
ya. Ya doin, listen to that G at the end,&nbsp;
ya doin, it's gone. It's also on vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:07.200
Maybe it's on vacation with the word are. So&nbsp;
let's say, ya doin anything fun this weekend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.840
ya doin, that's the main reduction that's going&nbsp;
to happen in this question. Ya doin anything fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:18.320
this weekend. Ya doin. Try to say that with me. Ya&nbsp;
doin anything fun this weekend? Ya doin anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.280
fun this weekend. All right, let's go onto some&nbsp;
other common things that you will hear in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.560
types of small talk, easy casual conversations.
If someone tells you about their weekend plans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.920
and it sounds interesting or fun, how can you&nbsp;
reply? You might say, "That sounds like fun," or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:45.600
"How interesting," or just simply, "Nice." If that&nbsp;
person is doing nothing, they're just sitting at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.760
home, maybe they're going to binge watch some&nbsp;
TV and stay in. Well sometimes it's nice to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:58.160
still say something positive in response. So you&nbsp;
might say, "Sometimes it's nice to do nothing."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.120
And that's true, especially if you've been&nbsp;
doing a lot, sometimes it's nice just to stay in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.760
and relax for the weekend. So you might say,&nbsp;
"Sometimes it's nice to do nothing." All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.640
Before we practice our sample conversation&nbsp;
together. What can you say at the end?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:18.000
Well, if you're talking about weekend plans, it&nbsp;
is before the weekend. So you could just say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.680
"Have a good weekend" or "Enjoy your weekend."&nbsp;
Simple, great way to end the conversation.&nbsp;

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.320
All right, let's take a deep breath. Are you&nbsp;
ready to put all of this together? What I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.960
would like you to do is, first, I would like&nbsp;
you to listen to this sample conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.960
Think about the different parts that&nbsp;
are happening. You're going to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:45.440
our key beautiful question. What about you? How&nbsp;
about you? You're going to also hear some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:52.080
key vocabulary that we talked about, and also just&nbsp;
some of the questions, the introductory questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.160
what you got going on this weekend? Great&nbsp;
things like that, that we'll put together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.400
And then I'm going to put some pauses&nbsp;
and it's going to be your turn to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.160
the conversation with me. So first&nbsp;
let's watch the conversation sample.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.800
"Hey, whatch up to this weekend?" "Not that&nbsp;
much. I'm just going to stay in and catch up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.320
some chores on Saturday. But on Sunday, I'm going&nbsp;
to meet up with some of my friends for brunch."&nbsp;

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.800
"That sounds fun. Where's your&nbsp;
favorite brunch spot?" "I usually go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.440
Sunday Morning Cafe." "What about you? What&nbsp;
have you got going on this weekend?" "I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.600
kind of a homebody. So I'll probably just read&nbsp;
a book in my hammock." "That sounds nice. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.200
have a good weekend. Enjoy your book." "Thanks.&nbsp;
You too. Have a good weekend." All right. Are you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.920
ready to take this to the next level? I'm going&nbsp;
to be asking you a question and then pausing. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:51.840
I would like you to reply in that pause. Take a&nbsp;
moment. Tell me about your plans. You can do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.840 --> 00:18:03.120
Let's go. "Hey, whatch up to this weekend?"
"How interesting. How often do you do that?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.280
"Oh, me? Oh, I'll probably go hiking&nbsp;
since the weather's going to be so warm."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.520
"Well, nice talking to you. Have a good weekend."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.400
Well, how did you do? If you would like you can go&nbsp;
back and practice that little sample conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.440
You can take a deep breath, enjoy yourself.&nbsp;
That's part of learning English. Because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.960

journey. So now I have a question for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;
