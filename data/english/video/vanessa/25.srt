Vanessa: Hi.

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:04.290
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.860
Let's talk about starting a conversation.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.779
Vanessa: To improve your speaking skills in
English, you need to speak, right?

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.820
Practice the skills that you want to improve.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.410
It's that easy.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.699
Well, maybe it's not that easy.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.570
Vanessa: Hi.
Dan: Hi.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.359
Vanessa: What do I say next?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.490
Why isn't he talking more?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.840
Dan: Oh, no.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.440
I don't know what to say.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.980
Vanessa: You know what?

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.630
This has probably happened to you in your
native language, so it makes sense that in

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.760
English, it can be tough to start a conversation,
too.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.730
But, never fear, Vanessa's tips are here!

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.510
Vanessa: In life, there are two kinds of people;
people you know and people you don't know.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.700
We call those strangers.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.370
So, it makes sense to have two different types
of conversation starters.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.440
Of course, there's some overlap, but it's
helpful to separate them.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.280
Vanessa: Let's start with people you know.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.320
Imagine that you are in the grocery store,
you're pushing your cart, looking for some

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.280
spinach, and you see a co-worker, and you
want to say, hi.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280
What can you say?

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.620
Well, here are four great questions that you
can ask in that situation, or that they might

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.990
ask you, so you need to understand them and
how to respond.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.470
Vanessa: The first two questions are about
the past.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.500
Let's take a look.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.520
Vanessa: Hi, Dan.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.870
Dan: Hi.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.080
Vanessa: How are you?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.080
Dan: Pretty good.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.560
Vanessa: What’ve(have) you been up to lately?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.400
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.200
Just went to see my family yesterday.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.200
What about you?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Vanessa: Hi, Dan.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
Dan: Hi.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Vanessa: How are you?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Dan: Pretty good.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Vanessa: What were you up to this weekend?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.890
Just went to see my family yesterday.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.890
What about you?

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.300
Vanessa: These questions asked about sometime
in the past.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.840
You can change the words to say, "lately",
"today", "last weekend", for “a recent holiday".

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.799
You can switch that up depending on the situation,
but it's great to ask about the past.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.340
Vanessa: The next questions are going to ask
about the present.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.540
Vanessa: What do you have going on today?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.020
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.909
Just going to a friend's house this evening.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:05.909
What about you?

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.740
Vanessa: What’ve (have) you got going on
today?

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.189
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.080
Just going to a friend's house this evening.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.080
What about you?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.779
Vanessa: These questions asked about the present.

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.849
Did you notice the beautiful, casual verbs
that were used here?

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.110
"What've you got going on today?"

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.379
"What have you got going on today?"

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.079
"What are you doing today?"

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.510
That's another way to say it, but we often
say, "What have you got going on today?",

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.870
and it's really casual, informal, it's great
for these just, passing by, situations when

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.840
you see someone who you already know.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.359
Vanessa: Let's go on to the next questions,
which talk about the future.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.879
Vanessa: Do you have anything fun going on
this weekend?

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.279
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.040
Just going to a friend's house tomorrow.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040
What about you?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.859
Vanessa: Do you have any plans for Easter?

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.430
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.260
Just going to have lunch with my family.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.299
What about you?

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.620
Vanessa: For these questions that ask about
the future, I want you to be a little bit

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.659
careful, because if you say this with a certain
type of intonation, the other person, especially

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.439
if you're a guy talking to a girl, it could
feel like you're trying to ask them on a date,

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.510
or maybe they'll feel a little bit uncomfortable.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.249
So, make sure that when you say, "Oh, do you
have anything fun going on this weekend?"

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.110
Make sure you say it with a smile, very casually.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.510
You don't need to look them into the eye and
say it seriously from the bottom of your heart.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.930
It's just a casual question.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.180
Of course, unless you do want to ask them
for a date.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.639
And then, you can say it a little more seriously.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.079
But if you just want to casually say something
to your co-worker, you need to have a light

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.079
tone.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.150
Don't worry about using this, just make sure
you have a light tone, and you say it with

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.150
a smile.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.569
"Oh, do you have anything fun going on this
weekend?"

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.569
Great.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.099
Like you saw on those sample conversation,
Dan could have just said, "Not much."

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.730
And then, stopped the conversation.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.069
Boring, boring, boring.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.890
But you know?

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.209
Some people do that.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.379
If you're lucky, the person you're talking
to might ask, "Not much, what about you?"

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.569
Okay, at least they're asking a question,
and you can share some information about what

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.629
you're doing, or what you did over the weekend.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.979
So, here, not everyone is going to give a
lot of information, but they might give you

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.639
something, and if they don't, don't worry
about it, it's not your fault, you tried your

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.659
best.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.830
What about the second kind of people?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.139
People you don't know.

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.139
Strangers.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.650
In the U.S., we sometimes strike up a conversation
with strangers, but it depends where you are.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.310
For example, in the south of the U.S. where
I live, it's pretty common that when you pass

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.250
by a stranger, you make eye contact and you
might say, "Hi."

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.530
But, if you're in Manhattan in New York, if
you did that to every stranger who you passed

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.629
by, "Hi.

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:47.629
Hi.

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:48.629
Hi."

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:49.629
People would think you're a little bit strange.

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.520
So, it depends on where you are in the U.S.,
but it's certainly common to strike up a conversation

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.260
with someone who you don't know.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.159
If you visit the U.S., I recommend visiting
a grocery store called Trader Joe's, because

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:05.260
it's a requirement for working there that
every employee is amazing at having small

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.939
talk conversations with strangers, and it's
part of their job to talk with customers.

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.980
So, if you have ever visited a Trader Joe's,
you know exactly what I mean.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.970
These employees are known for being so kind
and so friendly, and if you go there, be prepared

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.310
with some of these questions and be prepared
to answer them, because they'll definitely

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.599
ask you them.

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.000
Let's think about a scenario where you might
talk with the stranger.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.939
We can imagine you're in the park.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:35.800
You're walking your dog, and like dogs do,
your dog is sniffing and going towards another

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
dog.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.240
Well, you'd like to strike up a conversation
with the owner of that dog.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.310
What can you say?

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.730
Vanessa: Aww, what a cute dog.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.730
Do you come here often?

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.110
Dan: Yeah, we try to.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.110
It's a great place to walk.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.560
Vanessa: Aww, what a cute dog.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.560
Have you ever been here before?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.919
Dan: Yeah, a lot.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.569
It's a great place to walk.

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.690
Vanessa: Aww, what a cute dog.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.340
Dan: Yeah, he's a sweetie.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.210
Vanessa: Have you been in Asheville for a
while?

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.620
Dan: Just two years.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.620
What about you?

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.569
Vanessa: Aww, what a cute dog.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.220
Dan: Yeah, he's a sweetie.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.620
Vanessa: Do you live nearby?

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.680
Dan: Yeah, we live just down the street.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
What about you?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.500
Vanessa: Like with the previous set of questions,
it's important to have a light attitude.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.759
If you ask someone, "Do you come here often?"

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.160
The other person might feel a little bit uncomfortable,
like, "Are they following me?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.509
Are they a scary person?"

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.250
So, make sure you just say it lightly.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.849
"Oh, do you come here often?"

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:33.990
No problem.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.060
This is a great question to ask.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.319
And I ask this all the time when I go to the
park and I'm playing with my toddler, and

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.270
he ends up playing with another kid, and I
ask the parent, "Oh, do you come here often?"

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.069
It's just a way to start a conversation.

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.610
Okay, now it's special notice time.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.939
I want to let you know that not everyone is
a great conversationalist.

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.950
You have to try your best and practice this.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.169
So, if you ask these questions to someone,
and they don't respond, and you don't have

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.300
an amazing conversation, you know what?

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.060
Maybe they're just not a good conversationalist.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.800
Maybe they haven't practiced this skill.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.060
So, I want you to be able to try your best,
and then, it's really up to the other person.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.789
It's their choice if the conversation continues.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:20.189
You might be thinking, "Vanessa, you seem
like a good conversationalist.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.770
What do you know about being worried about
what to say, or not knowing what to say?"

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.100
Let me tell you a little story.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.719
Well, Dan and I lived in South Korea for three
years.

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:35.379
So, that means that for three years, every
time that I had small talk or started a conversation

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:37.789
with someone, it was in Korean.

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:42.060
That means that I didn't practice small talk
in English for three years.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.370
When we moved back to the U.S., I remember
two situations.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.270
One was when I was getting my drivers license
because we had just moved back, so I needed

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.180
my driver's license again.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.110
And the man at the desk said something to
me like, "Have you just moved here," or "How's

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.110
your day going?"

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.249
Some kind of typical small talk question.

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:04.999
And I just did there, and I stuttered, and
I didn't really know what to say.

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:09.199
And then, he repeated the question, and I
said something, probably something silly,

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:14.470
and when I walked away from that conversation,
I just laughed and thought, "What happened?

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.800
This is my native language.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.870
Why can't I respond to him?"

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:23.680
And then, I realized, "Oh, I haven't practiced
small talk with strangers in English in three

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.680
years.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.449
I'm going to need a little bit of practice
to get used to speaking like that again."

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:32.960
Then, a few weeks later, I was at Trader Joe's,
the grocery store that I mentioned to you,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.700
and I was getting a sample of food from one
of the workers, and she asked me some typical

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.700
question.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.830
I don't even remember what it was, but it
was some kind of small talk question, and

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:48.190
my brain just went, "Meeer," and shut down
completely.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.650
And I recognized this feeling because it happened
a couple weeks earlier at the driver's license

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.650
place.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.370
So, I thought, I should just tell her why
I am reacting like this.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.700
So, I said, "I'm sorry.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:05.160
I just moved back from Korea and I haven't
had small talk in English for a long time,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.360
so I'm sorry about my awkwardness."

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.600
And, you know what, she had lived in Korea,
too.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.370
It was a really unusual circumstance, but
we bonded over that, and I could kind of loosen

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.140
up a little bit and feel comfortable, because
we started talking a little bit.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.620
And this helped me to get practice.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.480
And practice and practice and repetition is
what's going to help you to really improve

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.510
this skill.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.520
Always remember that, a smile is the best
tool.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.130
Sometimes when we feel nervous, our face gets
really serious and we forget to smile.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:41.120
But, something happens when you smile, you
start to loosen up.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.540
You start to feel a little more comfortable,
and maybe you'll be able to remember some

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.660
of the sentences and questions that we talked
about.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.820
All right, my challenge for you is this, choose
one of these questions that you're going to

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.310
ask in your next English conversation, practice
it by writing it in the comments, and check

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.600
out to see what other students questions are,
too.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.890
It's a good chance to pretend that they're
asking you.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.520
Pretend to answer it, and really use this
repetition.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.590
Thanks so much for learning English with me,
and I'll see you again next Friday for a new

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.400
lesson here on my YouTube channel.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.840
Bye.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.120
Vanessa: Do you have anything fun going on
this weekend?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.520
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.270
Just going to a friend's house tomorrow.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.270
What about you?

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.270
Vanessa: Don't do that.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.270
(haha!)

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.270
Vanessa: Hi, Dan.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.270
Dan: Hi.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.270
Vanessa: How are you?

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.270
Dan: Pretty good.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.700
Vanessa: What were you up to this weekend?

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.700
Vanessa: Hi Dan.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.940
Dan: Hi.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.500
Vanessa: How are you?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.420
Dan: Pretty good.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.540
Vanessa: What have you been up to lately?

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.150
Dan: I don't remember.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.760
Dan: Oh, not much.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.940
Just went to see my family yesterday.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.960
What about you?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.070
Vanessa: Aww, what a cute dog.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.830
Dan: Yeah, he's a sweetie.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.900
Vanessa: Have you been in Asheville for a
while?

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.140
Dan: Just two years.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.530
What about you?

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:03.540
Vanessa: I have a unicorn dog.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.840
Dan: I want a corn dog?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.150
Vanessa: I have a unicorn dog, not I want
a corn dog.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.910
Dan: I thought you said, "I want a corn dog."

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.910
Unicorn dog.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.440
Vanessa: Aww, What a cute ... What a cutie.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.470
But, I said, "Cutie dog".

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.920
Vanessa: Aww, what a cute dog.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.920
Dan: Mmm.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920
Thanks.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920
Vanessa: Mmm.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920
Thanks.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.130
