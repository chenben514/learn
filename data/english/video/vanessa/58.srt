00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.229
Hi.

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.660
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.570
I get this question a lot, "Vanessa, why can
I understand you but I can't understand other

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.719
English speakers?"

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.809
Today I wanna give you three reasons why.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.140
Let's talk about it.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.550
The first reason why you can understand me
but not other english speakers in TV shows

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.510
and movies, is because the topic that we're
talking about is a pretty comfortable topic

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.510
for you.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.469
We're not talking about economics, politics
or sociology.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.480
We're talking about learning English.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.480
So this is something that you feel pretty
comfortable with already, you've probably

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.950
been studying English for a while.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.360
So the kind of vocabulary that you need to
use in these videos is pretty basic.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.390
So I think this is a great reason why you
probably understand me in these videos more

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.620
than TV shows, but let's talk about the second
reason why.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.200
To be honest, when I first started making
YouTube videos, I was kinda surprised that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.941
so many people could understand me, because
when my husband Dan watched my videos, he

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:18.680
told me, "Vanessa, you're talking too fast.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.700
People aren't gonna be able to understand.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.750
You're teaching English, you need to speak
slower and in a better way so that people

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.880
can understand you."

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.640
But I kept getting comments from people who
said, "Vanessa, I can understand you.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.790
This is great!"

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.750
So I've continued in that way and forgot his
advice.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.310
So this was a little surprising to me, but
after thinking about it, I realized that even

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.820
though I speak pretty quickly, this is pretty
natural speed.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.750
I do speak clearly and I think this is just
something about my style of speech, where

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.510
I speak clearly but I do speak fast.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.200
So I think that's something that hopefully
will test your ears and help you start to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200
get ready.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.680
I don't wanna speak like this, "Welcome to
this English channel.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.030
I'm so glad that you are here."

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.060
That's boring and it's not your level.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.780
This is for intermediate learners.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.819
So I wanna speak quickly and at a difficult
pace, but clearly.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.730
So I hope that that's useful for you.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760
I wanna test your ears, but also speak clearly.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.360
The third reason why you can understand me
but you can't understand other English speakers

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.830
as much is because simply, it's just me.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.620
It's not a conversation.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.840
You're just listening to me talk and you're
focusing on my voice.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.360
So because these videos are one person.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.489
You're not needing to focus on multiple people
at the same time and in TV shows and in movies,

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.879
you're often gonna hear two or three or five
people talking together, and that's real life.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.560
So I wanna be able to present that to you
to share real conversations with you, and

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.689
that's what a lot of my premium course, 'The
Fearless Fluency Club' is about.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:14.989
I present two conversations per month to you
with me and another English speaker and with

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.510
me and Dan, my husband talking about vocabulary,
talking about a natural topic because I wanna

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.510
test your ears.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.239
I wanna help train you to be able to understand
everyone and anyone, and that's really important,

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.909
to hear multiple people talking at the same
time.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.690
I hope that today's video and these three
ideas were useful for you.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.819
I wanna help you start to understand other
native speakers now.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.230
So I wanna give you a special sample lesson
set that you can start watching and testing

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.340
your ears.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.640
If you click on the 'I' at the top up here
or in the description below, you can watch

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.700

You're gonna see a conversation between my
sister and I, you're gonna see a conversation

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.579
between Dan, my husband and I, and you're
gonna be able to really learn what is going

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.579
on.

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.409

you to understand other speakers.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.290

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.860
understand it and use it yourself of course.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.070
So I hope that you'll join me and watch this
sample lesson set and I hope it's useful for

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.070
you.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.780
So far, hundreds of English learners have
really enjoyed it.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.170
So you can be there too.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.770
Thanks so much every one.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.920
Have a beautiful day.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.840
See you the next time, bye.
