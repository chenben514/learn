00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:04.520
Vanessa: Hello, hello.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.520
Dan: Hello.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.990
Vanessa: Welcome to today's live English lesson
here in our wonderful YouTube community in

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.120
the Speak English with Vanessa YouTube channel.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.590
I'm Vanessa and I'm here with my husband Dan.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.590
Dan: Hello everybody.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.640
Vanessa: We're going to be talking about a
really important topic today that everyone

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.880
encounters in life, so I hope that you'll
be able to expand your vocabulary skills but

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.050
also test your listening skills because Dan
and I are both native English speakers and

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.790
I hope that the way that we talk together
is understandable, but also a little bit challenging.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.690
Make sure you take notes and try to remember
some of the expressions that we talked about

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.670
and write some notes in comments or in the
chat so that you can use them as we're talking.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.890
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.880
Vanessa: Okay, are you ready to get started?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.880
Dan: I'm ready.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.880
Vanessa: All right.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.880
Dan: Let's do this.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.880
Vanessa: I have a question for you, Dan.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880
Dan: Yes, what?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.840
Vanessa: I want to know when was a time that
you had to get out of your comfort zone?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.140
Dan: Yeah, okay, we're going to talk about
getting out of your comfort zone.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.960
One might say I'm getting out of my comfort
zone right now.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.960
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.070
Dan: Maybe, because you know it's very comfortable
to just I don't know, sit on the couch and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.010
watch some videos on YouTube, hey, some of
you might be doing that now but sometimes

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.970
it makes me a little nervous to speak publicly
to people so it's getting out of my comfort

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.220
zone to talk to a lot of people.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.700
I would say probably the most intense example
in our life was when we taught in South Korea.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.620
We taught English in South Korea and we really
got out of our comfort zone there.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.210
Dan: One day we were in America, then we took
an airplane and then the next day, we were

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.810
teaching English, so that was not very comfortable.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.420
Vanessa: You had never taught English before,
right?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.729
Dan: Yeah, no, so that was a completely new
experience for me.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.610
I'd never been a teacher before.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.510
Nothing, it was just completely new so one
could say I really just gave it a shot as

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.510
well.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.510
Vanessa: Oh, you gave it a shot.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.560
This is an idiom that I'd like to talk about
so thank you for mentioning it, Dan.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.920
What does it mean to give it a shot?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.380
Dan gave teaching a shot.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.670
He just gave it a shot.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.290
Dan: Yeah, so that means you're going to try
and just try your best.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.290
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.719
Dan: To me, this sounds a little more risky
to give something a shot so maybe you'll actually

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.250
fail so-
Vanessa: The kids could laugh at you.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
Dan: Right.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.519
Vanessa: Or you just start to cry because
you're so scared.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.120
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah, basically
it just means you're going to try and you're

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.159
going to try really hard.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.629
Vanessa: Yeah, so I think this is a great
idiom that you can use when you're trying

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.719
to give yourself courage to speak with someone
else.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.930
When you want to speak with someone in English,
you need to get outside your comfort zone.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.310
Dan's examples have been perfect for that.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.689
Doing something that's a little bit different,
maybe a little bit more difficult or risky

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.359
than what you usually do.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.600
Dan: It makes you nervous.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.529
Vanessa: Yes, it makes you nervous so when
you're sitting on the couch watching this

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:06.809
lesson, you probably don't feel your heart
pounding but maybe right now Dan's heart is

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.739
pounding because he's getting out of his comfort
zone.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.459
I make lessons and videos a lot, I still feel
a little bit nervous each time but maybe for

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.609
Dan, he's getting out of his comfort zone
more to do this type of lesson but when he

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:27.639
or when we both went to do something new and
try something completely different, we gave

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.080
it a shot.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.299
This means we're just trying it.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.340
Maybe we'll succeed, maybe we'll fail.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.180
I want to know for you when was a time that
you gave something a shot, that you just tried

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.790
it, there was some risk involved but you just
tried it.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.379
Dan: Yeah, and I would say we use give it
a shot for maybe smaller things too, like

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.889
if you want to try a new food, you're just
going to give it a shot, which means maybe

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.370
it's sushi.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.370
Do you like sushi?

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.599
I don't know but maybe you're uncertain about
sushi.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.449
Maybe you're a little scared but you say,
"I'm going to give it a shot," so you just

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:06.449
try a little bit.

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.790
Vanessa: Yeah, it doesn't have to be a whole
new life experience like moving to a new country,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.880
it could just be something new like trying
a new food or maybe if you haven't been on

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.819
a date in a long time and you decide to go
on a date with someone and you feel pretty

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:27.380
nervous about it, you could say, "Okay, I'm
just going to give it a shot."

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.919
This full expression sticks together.

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.660
I'm just going to give it a shot and see what
happens.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.389
Maybe they're a wonderful person, maybe I
am really annoyed and bored after three minutes

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.800
but I'm just going to give it a shot and try
it.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800
This is great.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.169
Dan: Hey, when was the last time you gave
something a shot?

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.540
Vanessa: Well, I give stuff a shot a lot,
especially by teaching English, I'm always

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.759
trying new things, trying out new different
types of technology, new different ways to

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.560
create lessons for you but there's one time
in the past that I can think about giving

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.110
something a shot and that was when I was living
in France.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.160
The first week that I was in France, I needed
to do some official paperwork and I didn't

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.120
know hardly any French, this was my first
week there so I was really lost, but I had

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.540
to go to these government offices and fill
out this paperwork.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.560
Vanessa: First, I needed to find the office,
then I needed to communicate with the officials

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.400
at the office, and then I needed to answer
their questions and fill out the forms.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.060
There was a lot of things that were outside
my comfort zone and I just said, "Okay, I'm

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.300
going to give it a shot, I'm going to try
this.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.919
I don't have any French-speaking friends to
help me so I'm all alone, I have to do this."

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:47.960
Do you know what?

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.240
At the end of that day, it was a long day,
there was a lot of mistakes that I made but

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.659
at the end of the day, I felt so good.

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.340
Vanessa: It was amazing because I had eventually
succeeded.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.291
I gave it a shot and I found the office, I
talked to them, I filled out the forms, and

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:09.990
maybe for you if you do something outside
your comfort zone, you have that same experience.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.939
That there's a lot of mistakes along the way
but in the end, if you speak to someone else

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:22.419
in English and at the end of the conversation
you have this feeling of, I did it, I gave

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.210
it a shot, it feels really good.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.949
Dan: It does, yeah, unless it goes wrong.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.110
Vanessa: Unless it goes wrong.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.270
Dan: Have you ever given something a shot
and it went wrong?

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.610
Vanessa: Yes, but I want to hear your story
about this because I know it's quite interesting.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:43.610
Dan: One time I tried to prepare for a speech
in college but I didn't practice enough and

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.439
so I thought to myself oh, I'll just give
it a shot, right?

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.860
I'll just make this speech and-
Vanessa: Bad idea.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.590
Dan: Maybe I'll remember everything I need
to and I forgot everything.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.590
It was really bad.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:02.240
I stood up there and I had my paper and I
went like this, I don't remember and I had

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.240
to leave the room.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.469
It was really embarrassing.

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:06.909
I gave it a shot but I failed.

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:09.039
Vanessa: Yeah, so what happened after that?

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:14.430
Did you pick yourself up and continue after
that?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.749
What happened after you failed in that speech?

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:17.749
Dan: That day?

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:18.749
The same day?

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:19.749
Vanessa: Oh, after that in general.

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:25.389
Dan: In general, well the next time I practiced
a lot more so I learned something about this

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:32.150
and I practiced for my next speech probably
10 days in advance and I was really prepared

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.720
and I made a really good speech and I got
an A-plus on my next one.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.610
Vanessa: Great job, Dan.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.479
As you were telling that story about some
time you gave it a shot and it didn't go well,

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:48.669
I was thinking about one of the first times
that I ever interviewed another English teacher

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:50.850
for my YouTube Channel.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.979
If you go back a long time ago in my YouTube
channel, I interviewed some other YouTube

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:02.279
English teachers and one of the first interviews
that I did like this, I'd never used that

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:07.979
technology to record an interview before so
the technology was kind of new for me and

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:12.969
I thought, okay, I downloaded the technology,
I think I can do it, I'll just give it a shot,

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:14.340
but do you know what happened?

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.480
Vanessa: I recorded the whole interview with
only the audio.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:26.220
There was no video, so I felt so embarrassed
and I felt so bad because he said, "You know

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.030
what, let's just re-do the interview.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.699
Let's do it again and it'll be fine."

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:38.010
He was very forgiving and kind thankfully
but for me, I gave it a shot and it was pretty

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.010
embarrassing.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.010
Dan: She messed up.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.010
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.020
We have a great comment here from Vincent.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.340
Oh, Vincent, thank you for using the Super
Chat and sharing money with us, wow, you're

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.340
awesome.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.340
Dan: All right.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.340
Go Vincent.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.510
Vanessa: He said, "The last time I gave it
a shot was when I had to present a lecture

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.040
about Chinese herb therapy.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.940
I don't know if I should've used a present
or shown a lecture."

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.200
Oh, so maybe here you weren't sure if you
should've physically shown something or given

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.630
a lecture.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.660
"When I had to present a lecture or show a
lecture."

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.300
Present a lecture is the best expression.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.300
Dan: Yes.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.200
Vanessa: "To present a lecture about Chinese
herb therapy."

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:21.330
Just to let you know, when we use this expression,
we always use it in the middle, or we can

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.260
use that thing that's getting out of your
comfort zone so let me give you a quick grammatical

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.260
example.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:33.160
For Vincent's sentence he said, "The last
time I gave it a shot was when I presented

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.690
a lecture."

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.790
Or he could say, "I gave the lecture a shot."

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.390
The word it is referring to the lecture, so
you could put lecture in the middle of this

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.800
idiom or you could simply put it.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.430
No problem, so we've got two different grammatical
structures for this.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.320
Dan: Yeah, we don't just say give a shot.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320
Vanessa: Give a shot.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.170
Dan: If you say that then you're giving maybe
a shot of whiskey.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.430
Vanessa: Oh, or a gun.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.390
Dan: Oh, or maybe a medicine.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.180
Vanessa: Okay, getting a shot, so there's
other ways that we could use this, but we

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.270
need to say give it a shot.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.270
Dan: Give it a shot.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.270
Vanessa: Yeah, great way to use it.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.280
Dan: Is there any other expression that kind
of is talking about getting out of your comfort

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.280
zone?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.810
Vanessa: Yeah, so I want to ask you another
question, Dan.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:17.600
When you were teaching in Korea, did you feel
like you were prepared for it or did they

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.130
just throw you in?

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.430
Dan: Ah yes.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.920
I would say I was thrown in.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.500
They threw me in.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.030
Vanessa: Did they actually take your body
and throw you into the classroom?

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.530
Dan: Yeah, no, so it doesn't literally mean
they picked me up and then threw me into the

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.530
classroom.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.530
Vanessa: No.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:41.650
Dan: No, it means that I wasn't really prepared
but they expected me to teach, right?

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.070
I didn't get a lot of preparation or training
like-

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:50.130
Vanessa: We had like one or two days of training,
kind of we shadowed the other teachers but-

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.570
Dan: Yeah, very, very little training.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.020
That would mean you're thrown in.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.770
We use this a lot for jobs, right?

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.770
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.250
Dan: Yeah, the best way to learn this job
is to be thrown in.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.890
Some people might say that to you.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.180
Vanessa: Yeah, I kind of feel like in some
ways teaching is like that.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.540
Every job you need to learn as you go.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:14.840
You need to learn with experience, so you
might say for Dan, he was thrown in on the

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.890
first day.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:21.550
This is a beautiful phrasal verb that means
you were expected to do something that was

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.140
outside your comfort zone, probably without
training, without too much training or much

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.230
training.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:33.250
I think for me, it was the same situation
when I was a teacher before that.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:39.100
Vanessa: Before we moved to Korea, I was an
English teacher in the US for middle school

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.380
and high school American kids.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:47.640
I wasn't teaching English as a second language,
I was teaching American kids about grammar,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.580
and Shakespeare, and essay skills, these types
of things that you learn in language class

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.130
but I had no idea what I was doing.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.810
I was a complete newbie.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:05.040
I had no idea about this type of teaching
style so on my first day in the classroom,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.010
there was zero training.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.470
No training.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.040
I was completely thrown into the classroom.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.010
Vanessa: Here we can imagine that I'm standing
in front of the students, thankfully I tried

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.070
to be really prepared but nobody helped me
to prepare.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.070
Dan: Yeah, she prepared herself.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.500
It wasn't like training and that would still
be throwing you in.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.521
Vanessa: Yes, so I'm curious for you, have
you ever experienced a time when you were

00:12:28.521 --> 00:12:34.430
thrown into a new experience, thrown into
a new job, or maybe you are sitting at your

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:40.650
desk and your boss says, "Oh, the American
branch, some of the employees from the American

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.570
branch are visiting us today, can you take
them to lunch today?"

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.570
Dan: Go give them a tour.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:50.240
Vanessa: Yes, and you immediately have to
speak in English with them, take them to lunch,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.420
show them around the city.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.570
You have no training, no preparation, you
were thrown into that situation.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:01.130
Dan: Yeah, and that situation you may even
use the really strong term, they threw me

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.130
to the wolves.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.050
Vanessa: Oh, I like that one.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:09.220
Dan: Yeah, if you're thrown to the wolves,
just imagine being put in front of angry and

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.050
hungry wolves, it's really scary.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:18.381
That means your boss or somebody puts you
in or threw you in a situation that you were

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:24.970
not ready for and maybe you got really scared,
or had a lot of pain, or you failed.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.310
You'd say they threw me to the wolves.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:31.580
Vanessa: They threw me to the wolves, so if
you have a first day at your new job, you

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:37.470
could tell your boss this as kind of a suggestion
or a request.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:44.140
You could say, "I would like to have some
training for a few days so please, don't throw

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.620
me to the wolves, or at my last job, they
threw me to the wolves so I appreciate that

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.990
you're training me."

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:57.310
You're kind of showing that before it was
a really scary experience but you're grateful

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.280
that they're not throwing you in, they're
giving you some training.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.440
Vanessa: I think everyone's experienced this
in some way but for English, it is very important

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.700
to get out of your comfort zone, just give
it a shot.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.240
If you get an opportunity to speak English,
give it a shot.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240
Just do it.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.530
Don't think about it, don't worry about the
failure, just think about the opportunity

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.770
being able to do it and maybe you haven't
practiced, you just need to throw yourself

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.970
in and do that.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.110
Dan: Yeah, somebody doesn't have to throw
you in, you can throw yourself in.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.110
Vanessa: Yes.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.310
Dan: I just need to throw myself into this
work, just go at it.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.320
Vanessa: Yes, I need to really just do it
myself.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.320
If you enjoyed talking about getting out of
your comfort zone and this idiom, give it

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:49.220
a shot, and the phrasal verb, to throw yourself
in, Dan and I are talking about this topic,

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:54.430
getting out of your comfort zone during our
course, the Fearless Fluency Club this month

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.100
in the month of May, doing something that's
a little bit risky.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.260
Doing something that maybe takes a little
bit of challenge for you.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Dan: Courage maybe?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.420
Vanessa: Yes, some courage.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.030
We're talking with our friend Mike who did
this.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:11.870
He really took an opportunity that was outside
his comfort zone and it was quite different

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.900
than his live so we talk about his experience
getting out of his comfort zone.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:21.420
There's a good chance to learn about this,
maybe challenge yourself and expand your vocabulary.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.520
Vanessa: What I'd like to do next is I'd like
to share my screen with you so that if you

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.110
would like to continue learning like this
with us, you can do that.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.620
Let me share my screen with you here really
quick.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.260
All right.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:42.250
You can see that here we're on the page for
the Fearless Fluency Club, which is our monthly

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:47.550
English subscription course where you can
expand your English, your conversation skills,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.700
your vocabulary, your grammar, your pronunciation.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:56.450
Vanessa: If you click on the link in the description,
you can go to this page and learn more details

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:02.090
about the course, and if you have any questions
about it, of course you can send me an email.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.770
If you decide to join this month in the month
of May, you'll be able to have access to the

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.860
course.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.110
This is the course for the month of May.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.810
We're going to be talking with Mike.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.500
Let's take a look at the beginning of this
conversation.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:23.200
Vanessa: You'll be able to learn this lesson
with Mike about his experience doing something

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.390
outside of his comfort zone.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:31.370
Something that I personally would never do,
but he decided to give a try and do it.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:36.160
It's a good chance to hear native speakers
talking together, but you'll also get a chance

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.660
in the vocabulary lesson to do exactly what
we did today, which is learn vocabulary with

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.110
Dan and I.
Vanessa: Here we're going to be talking about

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.330
all of the great vocabulary, this is a great
picture of Dan's face.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.670
Dan: Nice pause.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.220
Vanessa: We're going to be talking about all
of the vocabulary from the conversation with

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.500
Mike.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:02.500
You'll learn some important phrasal verbs
with Dan and I, and also with some extra clips,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:08.180
like some clips from movies, some clips from
songs to be able to improve your phrasal verbs

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:13.780
including to throw someone in, the phrasal
verb we talked about, and we'll also talk

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.890
about pronunciation so you'll be able to step
by step practice your pronunciation skills

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:25.040
and imitate my pronunciation and imitate Mike's
pronunciation in the conversation.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.510
Vanessa: All right, we're back.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:35.760
I want to thank you so much for learning with
us and hopefully thinking about getting outside

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.140
your comfort zone.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.721
In the comments below this video, I want to
know when was a time that you had to get out

00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:43.380
of your comfort zone.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:49.660
Can you use the expressions we talked about,
give it a shot or throw yourself in?

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.730
Can you use those?

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.080
Dan used them wonderfully.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080
Dan: I tried.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.500
Vanessa: Yes, I-
Dan: I gave it a shot.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:00.260
Vanessa: I hope that you can too, and I hope
that you will have a wonderful week.

Vanessa: Oh, I want to to show you something
before we go.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.750
Dan: She's forgetting something.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.750
Vanessa: Yes.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.511
Something happened last week that I'd like
to share with you.

00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:18.511
Let's see, can we-
Dan: Oh, what could be in this box?

00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:19.511
Vanessa: Open this up.

00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:20.511
Oh boy.

00:18:20.511 --> 00:18:21.511
Dan: Whoa.

00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:22.511
Can you take it out?

00:18:22.511 --> 00:18:23.511
Vanessa: Let's see if I can take it out.

00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:24.511
It's a little bit tough.

00:18:24.511 --> 00:18:25.511
Dan: Oh, it's all shiny now.

00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:26.520
Look at that.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.010
Vanessa: Oh wow.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.540
Dan: It's a trophy.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.810
Vanessa: Thank you everyone for one million
subscribers.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.230
