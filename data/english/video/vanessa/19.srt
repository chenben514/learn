00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.590
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.000
Dan: And I'm Dan.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.559
Vanessa: My husband, who is also going to
be giving another perspective in today's conversation.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.390
Today we're bringing you an amazing, long,
English conversation, so prepare your ears,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.580
prepare your mind.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.380
We're going to be talking about 12 different
topics, and hopefully providing some new expressions

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.100
and new ways to think about life.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.590
I don't know about that, but at least some
English help for you.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.761
Dan: Yeah, it's going to get personal today,
so get ready.

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:31.761
Vanessa: Yes.

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:32.761
All right, are you ready to get started?

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:33.761
Dan: I'm ready.

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:40.539
Vanessa: Let's go.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.620
Our first topic is family, and my question
is, who do you think that you're the most

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.620
like?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.579
Dan: Who am I the most like, in appearance?

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.030
Vanessa: Yes.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.190
Dan: Both appearance and character?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.499
Vanessa: Yeah, both.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.140
Dan: Okay, so appearance I look mostly like
my mom, I think.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140
Vanessa: Okay.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.069
Dan: I have more of her skin tone, I have
her eyes.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.069
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:07.939
Dan: And on her side of the family, most of
the people are pretty skinny, and I'm a rather

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.590
skinny guy.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.159
My dad's side is German, and they tend to
be a little bit bigger.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.860
So yeah, I definitely got my mom's side.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.680
But character wise, I think I'm a little more
like my dad.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.680
Would you agree?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.740
Vanessa: Yeah, I'd say you have shades of
your dad.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.880
Dan: You know me so well, so you can answer
this, too.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.880
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.310
Yeah, I think you have shades of your dad.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.310
Yeah.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.310
Dan: Shades, yeah.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.890
I think I'm more silly than my dad, that's
not very hard because my dad is pretty serious.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.149
Vanessa: Ah, he's got a silly side though.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.149
Dan: He does, yeah.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.189
But for the most part, I think I'm more like
my dad because he has a very calm demeanor,

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.229
he's very patient, and he doesn't get stressed
about anything.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.729
And actually, my dad gets so unstressed about
everything, I can't even understand it.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.049
I'm like, "How are you so calm right now?"

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.249
And everybody I know thinks that I'm the most
stress free person they know.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.119
Vanessa: But your dad is even more stress
free.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.570
Dan: Yeah, but we're similar, like growing
up when my parents would be going somewhere,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.790
and needing to get out of the house, me and
my dad would be the last one out of the house

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.280
every single time.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.533
Then we would be like, "What?

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:17.533
We'll make it.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:18.533
We'll be okay.

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:19.533
No problem."

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.879
Vanessa: And your mom, and brother, and sister
were saying, "Come on, hurry."

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.409
Dan: And my mom is like, "Ah, let's go."

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.530
My mom is much more high stress, anxious kind
of personality.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.830
Vanessa: That's kind of a typical family situation,
I think.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.190
Dan: Yeah, how about you?

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.489
Vanessa: I think I have both my parents in
me as well.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.890
I think I look a lot like my mom.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.459
Dan: Yeah, she looks exactly like her mom,
though, like to a T.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.980
Vanessa: Sometimes when I see pictures of
myself, and then I look at a picture of her

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.640
at the same age, I think, "Whoa.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640
We look really similar."

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.280
And she looks a lot like her mom, so I can
kind of imagine what I'll look like when I'm

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280
getting older.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280
Dan: Yeah.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.150
I mean, you have darker hair, and darker features.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.150
You got that from your dad.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Vanessa: Yeah, somewhat.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.849
But I think a lot of my features are similar
to my mom.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.200
But I think I also got my facial expressions
from my mom.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200
Dan: Yes.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.290
Vanessa: A lot of comment that, "Wow, Vanessa,
you have a lot of expressions."

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.549
Dan: Your mom is very expressive, just like
you.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.959
Vanessa: And I think it's true that I use
a lot of expressions, but it's just natural

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.959
for me.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.870
I do this in daily life as I'm talking about
things.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.540
And I think that I get that from my mom, sometimes
I see some of her expressions and I realize,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.590
"Oh, I do that too."

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.480
Dan: Yeah, I remember when we lived in South
Korea, every single Korean person was commenting

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.670
on Vanessa's expressions.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.770
They're like, "Your face, it's so exciting.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.599
How are you making so many faces?"

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.599
Everybody was surprised.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.599
Vanessa: I don't know.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.530
Dan: I guess in Korea they don't make as many
faces.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.050
Vanessa: I don't know, maybe it's just not.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.930
Maybe it's just an unusual trait.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.310
I'm grateful for that, especially as a teacher,
I can hopefully help to explain some different

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.210
concepts with my face as well.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.180
But I feel like I also have parts of my dad.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.670
My dad is a pretty rational guy.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.650
Dan: You're rational like your dad.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.239
Vanessa: Yeah, but I think I also have his
sense of humor, sometimes a little strange

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.840
sense of humor, but we laugh at the same things,
we enjoy playing games, and being competitive,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.380
so I think that that side of me, maybe some
of the character side of me, is similar to

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.380
him.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.940
But I feel like I also have parts of my grandma.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.100
My grandma is a go, go, go, go person.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.330
Dan: Oh, that's true.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Yeah.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.350
Vanessa: She never stops, and I think my biggest
flaw is that I have difficulty slowing down

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.090
and relaxing, I just keep going and I think
that-

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.250
Dan: That's why she's with me.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.000
Vanessa: ... I need help relaxing.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.850
Dan: I help her relax.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.470
Vanessa: Yeah, so I think that my grandma's
like this too, that she's always going, and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.420
always doing things, and it's healthy to slow
down every now and then.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.300
And so, I need to do that, she probably needs
to do that too sometimes.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.870
But I don't know if I learned that from her,
but maybe that's just part of my-

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.190
Dan: I think it's your personality.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.190
Vanessa: ... DNA, my character.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.509
Dan: Yeah, I can remember even when I first
met Vanessa, she was more go, go, go than

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.509
she is now.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.569
Vanessa: Oh, you think so?

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.569
Dan: Yeah.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.960
More like so this thing, then the next, and
the enthusiasm was always, she was like bouncing

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.960
everywhere.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960
Vanessa: I always have a lot of enthusiasm,
that's true.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.731
Dan: Yes, it was off the charts.

00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:24.450
Vanessa: Yeah, so I want to know for you,
who are you most like in your family?

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.590
Is it maybe your physical traits or for your
character?

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.180
All right, let's go on to our second question.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.410
The next topic is childhood.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.060
I want to know when do you think childhood
ends, and when do you become an adult?

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.319
Dan: When does childhood end?

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.840
Vanessa: This is a deep question.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.770
Dan: Well, I don't think it can be a specific
age, I think it's different for everyone.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.160
I think it's at any point you can leave this
house of your parents and live on your own,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
take care of yourself, and you're not dependent
on somebody else.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.500
Like if you're living with your friends and
bumming off them, you're probably not an adult

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.500
yet.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.259
So if I had to pick an age, I'd probably say
16.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.259
Vanessa: Oh.

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.410
Dan: Yeah, I'm saying kind of young.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.410
Vanessa: Okay.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.150
Dan: In an ideal world, I think a 16 year
old should be ready.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.150
Vanessa: Okay.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.150
Okay.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.150
I get it.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.150
At 16 were you ready?

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.490
Dan: No, of course not.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.490
Vanessa: Ideally.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.650
Dan: Ideally, yeah.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.370
I don't think our society prepares us to be
ready at 16.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.030
It prepares you to be ready at 18.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.430
Vanessa: Or later.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.289
Dan: Right, or later.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.960
But you know, in an ideal world I think you
could be ready at 16, but it's a kind of complicated

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.229
world now, so maybe 18 is an acceptable age.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.280
Vanessa: I feel like, for me, I have less
ideas about childhood ending and adulthood

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.710
starting that are physical.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.150
I feel like it has more to do with making
your own decisions.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.740
There might be a lot of reasons why you have
to live at home, or you have to be dependent

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:59.040
on someone else, but if you are making your
own decisions you are not a child, you're

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040
an adult.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.640
And I'm sure as our children get older and
become teenagers, that's going to be a little

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.960
bit harder for us to make that line for someone
else, but I know for myself-

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.139
Dan: Well, this is-
Vanessa: ... making more decisions.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.310
Dan: ... assuming you are capable as a person
to live on your own, of course.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.310
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.220
Yeah, I think you can still be an adult just
making your own decisions, but we still need

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.750
help from other people as adults, so there's
a... it's a gray area.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.750
Dan: Sure.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.750
Yeah.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.750
I would-
Vanessa: Yeah, it's not so clear.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.240
Dan: ... also add, I don't know, for myself
personally, having children really makes you

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.570
an adult.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.500
It doesn't have to be true for everyone, but
I think it's easier for some people to just

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.889
kind of be really selfish, and do their own
thing, and kind of live like a kid, especially

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:48.400
nowadays because we have so much entertainment,
you could just watch TV every day.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.090
A lot of guys I know play video games a lot,
and I'm not knocking on video games but playing

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.210
video games every day is a good way to remain
a child, at heart anyways.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.210
Vanessa: Sure.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.790
Dan: This is my opinion, it's a little judgemental,
but-

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.729
Vanessa: Yeah, I think if you are a good person,
and you have a child, then you feel forced

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:08.729
to be become an adult.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:09.729
Dan: Yes.

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:12.020
Vanessa: There's still bad people who have
kids, who remain children themselves-

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.020
Dan: That's true.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.020
Vanessa: ... and then they're bad parents.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.690
But I think if you're generally a good person,
when you have kids, it's kind of a shock.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.300
Dan: Yeah, well-
Vanessa: Like, "Whoa, this child is so dependent

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.300
on me.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.300
I need to be responsible.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.199
I have to organize myself somehow."

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.199
You have to change.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:31.860
Dan: ... I think being an adult, part of it
is having a burden of responsibility of some

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.490
kind, whether it's a job, or your house payments,
or whatever it is.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:42.790
Some people add those burdens of responsibility
anyways without children, but I don't know,

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.130
for me, it's just different.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.330
Like, "This is the person I'm taking care
of in my life."

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.330
People now-
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.630
Dan: ... because we've got two.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.430
Vanessa: Well, two coming up soon.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.550
So I have a question for you, when do you
think childhood ends?

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.220
When does adulthood start?

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.380
It's going to be different for every culture,
too because this is a pretty cultural specific

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.380
question.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.580
Maybe in the U.S.-
Dan: Yeah, maybe you have a-

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.880
Vanessa: ... it's different than your country.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.070
Dan: ... maybe you have a rite of passage
in your country.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.900
Vanessa: Oh, can you explain what a rite of
passage is?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.120
Because that's kind of a nuanced thing.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.320
Dan: Yeah, a rite of passage is something
that every boy or every girl does to become

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320
an adult.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.740
Vanessa: Oh, like some ceremony, or activity.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.180
Dan: Yeah, like a ceremony.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.410
Yeah, I mean, we don't really have this in
the U.S., some people say college is a rite

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.710
of passage, but not...

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.950
I mean, more and more, almost everybody goes
to college now.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.380
Vanessa: A lot of people do, but-
Dan: Yeah, so it kind of is, but it's a really

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.420
bad one because usually people just go, and
they have parties, and they live really irresponsibly.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.650
Vanessa: It's not a way to become a responsible
adult.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.590
Dan: Yeah, and then you do more school.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.590
Vanessa: Ah, yes.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.940
Dan: It's not really becoming a man.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.670
Vanessa: Changing your life completely.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.670
Yeah.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.720
So I'm curious, in your country is there something
that signifies, "Now you are an adult.", this

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.290
kind of rite of passage ceremony, or festivity,
or party that you have.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.571
In the U.S. we don't really have that, but
I think it's kind of a cool idea that you're

00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:06.240
celebrating-
Dan: I wish we did.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.410
Vanessa: ... this big change, going from childhood
to adulthood, and it is a gray area, at least

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.951
in the U.S. it's a really gray area, so it's
nice to celebrate that as parents, that your

00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.190
kids are adults, hopefully.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.800
And that as a child, "Oh, great, now I'm an
adult.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.190
Society sees me as an adult."

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.750
So I think it's kind of a cool idea, but maybe
it's something we can do with our future kids.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.810
All right, let's go onto the next topic.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.600
The next topic is jobs.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.630
I want to know what was your worst job ever.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.400
Dan: Worst job ever?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.410
Dan: Well, I have two competing jobs.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.940
Vanessa: Hopefully it's not your current job,
making English lessons.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.550
Dan: It's video editing and doing these videos.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.550
Vanessa: Oh, no.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.410
Dan: I can't stand working with my wife.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.560
Just kidding.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.290
It's the best.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.290
Yeah.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.230
So yeah, really my worst job, if I had to
pick just one, it would be being a dishwasher.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.550
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.300
Dan: Now notice, there's no differentiation
between the machine, a dishwasher, and the

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.600
person who is a dishwasher, it's the same
word.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.540
Vanessa: So you were like the machine, you
were washing dishes.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.540
Dan: Yeah.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.590
I mean, you did have a machine, so you'd have
something on the side you'd slide the dishes

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:23.830
in and all that, but it's just, I was also
like, I think I was 16 at the time, an adult

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:30.150
and I had no friends in the restaurant.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.160
They were all older and they were all really
tough.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.430
I don't know, in America, when you... the
kitchens have a reputation for having really

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:44.380
kind of tough kitchen cooks, and they all...
they swear a lot, and they make foul jokes-

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.960
Vanessa: They've had a lot of life experiences.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:51.620
Dan: ... and I was just like a little Christian
16 year old kid, washing dishes in the corner,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.680
trying to look like relatively normal.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.240
But I didn't talk to anybody-
Vanessa: And you were homeschooled.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.240
Yeah, no experiences.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.950
Dan: Yeah, well at that time I was in high
school.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:01.950
Vanessa: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.110
Dan: But it was a small, private school.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.410
Anyway-
Vanessa: You were very different from the

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.410
other people.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.140
Dan: ... not only was that really awkward,
it was also bad because washing dishes just

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.140
kind of stinks.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:17.020
You just get all the dishes, and some of the
guys used to make fun that I wasn't going

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.130
fast enough.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.950
One guy said, "Dan, you have two speeds, slow
and stop."

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.100
Vanessa: You're like a turtle?

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.100
Dan: Yeah, I'm like a turtle.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.070
Vanessa: Well, sometimes I still say that.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.670
Dan: I wasn't fast enough, and another time
I reached into the mucky, dirty water and

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.650
I cut my finger on a broken glass and I was
bleeding in the water.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.650
Vanessa: Oh.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.310
Things you don't want to know when you visit
a restaurant.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.010
Dan: And I was paid under the table.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.010
Vanessa: Oh, really?

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.010
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.270
Vanessa: Why'd they have to pay you under
the table?

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.440
Dan: I don't know, because it's an Italian
restaurant-

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440
Vanessa: Because you were too young?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440
Dan: ... in rural Pennsylvania.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.870
Vanessa: They didn't want to pay taxes on
their employees or something?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.870
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.870
Vanessa: Oh.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.870
Dan: Plus who wants to pay taxes on a dishwasher?

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.030
Vanessa: I wonder if it was because you were
16, like was there an age limit?

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.050
Dan: I might have even been 15 at the time.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.570
Vanessa: Okay, maybe you were under the legal
age that they could hire someone-

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.570
Dan: Could be.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.431
Vanessa: ... so they just paid you under the
table.

00:13:04.431 --> 00:13:05.431
Dan: Yeah, so that was pretty bad.

00:13:05.431 --> 00:13:06.431
Vanessa: That sounds pretty bad.

00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:07.970
Dan: Yeah, it was an awkward job.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.540
Vanessa: Especially as a first job, it just
seems uncomfortable.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.350
Dan: That was my second job.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.350
Yeah.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.350
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.350
Well-
Dan: How about you?

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.080
Vanessa: ... I feel like-
Dan: Could it beat that?

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:24.220
Vanessa: Well, I feel like my worst job wasn't
bad because of the social situation like yours,

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.200
it was bad because it was so boring.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:35.220
I worked for a summer at this office, I was
like a temporary employee just for the summer,

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.190
working kind of like a call center job.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:45.720
But every day they gave us these scripts and
we had to call companies who maybe this company

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.490
bought a printer within the last couple months.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.830
Dan: I'm bored just listening about it.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.010
Vanessa: Yeah, and I called the company and
said company and said, "Oh, I saw that you

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:58.720
recently bought the HP Inkjet printer, and
we have a upcoming training session on this

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.720
day.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.300
Would you like to attend the training session
about this printer?"

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.730
Dan: She does have a really good call voice,
though.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.180
Vanessa: And I called so many companies again
and again, talking with secretaries, talking

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:13.440
with other people, just saying, "Do you want
to go to this seminar about..." some electronic

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.280
device that they had recently bought.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.320
Dan: If you called me, I'd be like, "Yeah,
I do.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320
Can I buy more?"

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.500
Vanessa: Well, people were generally nice
to me, it was just... it wasn't a subject

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.160
that I was interested in, it wasn't something
I was trained to do, so I didn't feel like

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.310
it was my specialty, it was just a temporary
job to make money.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.180
Dan: And you were sitting in an office all
day, right?

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.150
Vanessa: Yeah, it was my first office job.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.690
Dan: Vanessa doesn't like to sit very long.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.540
Vanessa: No, I have to go, go, go, like we
talked about.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.910
So sitting in that office desk, it was just
not my thing.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.700
But the office, on the other hand, did really
try to make it interesting for the employees,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.840
because they knew most of the people I worked
with were in a similar position as me, where

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.170
it wasn't their life-long dream to work in
that job.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.090
So about once a week, we had these game show
competitions-

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.320
Dan: That sounds fun.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.090
Vanessa: ... where at lunch, during the lunch
break, everyone would go to the lunchroom,

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.880
if you wanted to of course, and they had these
competitions kind of like Wheel of Fortune,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.490
or Jeopardy, and the company just had them
for the employees.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.210
Sometimes we had dress up days where we dressed
up like cowboys, or dressed up like... they

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.260
were trying to make it interesting.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.360
Dan: Come on, this is better than being a
dishwasher.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.081
Vanessa: It's probably better than being a
dishwasher, but I just felt like they were

00:15:28.081 --> 00:15:31.680
trying so hard to keep employees-
Dan: To make it interesting.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.950
Vanessa: ... to make it interesting-
Dan: All right.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.330
Vanessa: ... because they knew this is not
an interesting job.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.730
Dan: Yeah, can I say my second worst job?

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.730
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.730
Sure.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.180
Dan: Can you guess what it is?

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.610
Vanessa: I know you worked at a lot of coffee
shops, but those weren't that bad.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.160
Dan: Working at a coffee shop is good.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
It's fun.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160
Vanessa: Okay, well what was it?

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.160
Dan: It's the sharpshooter.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.890
Vanessa: Oh, can you explain about that job?

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:57.410
Dan: Yeah, so I don't know if you've ever
seen this in your country, but have you ever

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.110
been to a place where somebody takes your
picture, and then later they try to sell you

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.670
that picture?

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.230
I was that guy.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:11.820
So we took the same pictures, it was going
onto a boat on one of the rivers in Pittsburgh.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.220
Vanessa: So it was kind of like a cruise boat,
but a river cruise.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.220
Dan: Yeah, kind of.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.350
It was very kitschy though, like not high
class at all.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:25.780
So people, before they got on the boat, we
forced them to stop and go through the line,

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.070
and we'd take their picture.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.120
And it was required, but people were like,
"I don't want to get my picture taken."

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.500
Vanessa: And everyone had their own cameras
and phones.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.500
Dan: And this is...

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.500
Yeah.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.230
Mind you, this is in like 2010, where people
already have phones on their cameras and stuff.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.780
I mean, that's at least getting more popular.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.580
Vanessa: Yeah, they didn't need your picture.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.610
Dan: No.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.010
So I had to take everybody's picture, and
then when they got off the boat, I stood at

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.480
the side and said, "Hey, come over here, buy
this picture."

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.040
And they were like $20 for one picture.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040
Vanessa: Crazy.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.580
Dan: A terrible rip-off, even I knew it was
a terrible rip-off, just not a worthwhile

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.280
business, at least in 2010 when I was doing
that job.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.470
Vanessa: Yeah, maybe 10 years before that
it would have been cool.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.120
Dan: Yeah, it was a viable business like 30
years ago.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120
Vanessa: But not now.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.199
Dan: Yeah, but not any more.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:17.190
That was really bad, and one time somebody
stole one of my pictures and I actually got

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.220
fired from that job.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.530
Vanessa: Because they stole a picture.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.420
Dan: Because they stole a picture and I couldn't...

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.200
I didn't catch them on time, and I was like,
"Good riddance."

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.540
Vanessa: Yeah, "Goodbye to this job.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.540
Goodbye forever."

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.540
Dan: Yeah.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.850
The only reason this was better than the other
job, than dish washing, is because I worked

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.040
with some people who were funny and we got
along pretty well.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.010
Vanessa: And you were outside, you were by
the river.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.010
Dan: It was okay.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.290
Vanessa: Except you did have to drive an hour
to get there, that's crazy.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.660
Dan: I did drive an hour to work.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.070
Vanessa: You should never drive an hour to
get to a part-time job.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.920
Dan: But that was my fault, I wanted to work
in Pittsburgh, and I still lived... did I

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.010
live with my parents?

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.270
Vanessa: Yeah, I think so.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.420
Dan: I think I did.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.770
I wasn't an adult yet.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.770
Vanessa: Oh.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.770
Oh.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.770
All right.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.420
Well, I'm curious for you, what is the worst
job that you've ever had?

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.670
Let us know.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.510
And let's go to the next topic.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.040
The next topic is travel.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.470
I want to know what are three locations that
you would like to visit or revisit in the

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.900
U.S.?
Dan: In the U.S.?

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.900
Vanessa: Yes.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.820
Dan: Why just the U.S.?
Vanessa: Well, the world's a big place, so

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.850
I had to narrow down the question somehow.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:18.850
Dan: Okay.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:19.850
All right.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.710
The first place I'd say is the Grand Canyon.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.710
Vanessa: Okay.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.740
Dan: Because of course you have to see the
Grand Canyon, right?

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.050
I've never been there.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:31.970
I used to live in Colorado, but my family
never made a trip to the Grand Canyon, and

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.940
it just would be an amazing sight, I'm sure
of it.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.940
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.940
Yeah.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.160
Dan: Second would be the Pacific Northwest,
just in general.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.160
Vanessa: Okay.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.450
Dan: Because I've heard it-
Vanessa: Not like Portland, Seattle, and specific?

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.700
Just-
Dan: I think I would like to go to Seattle

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.500
because it's a big city and the city sounds
cool.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.950
Not many cities in the U.S. are that interesting
to me because I've traveled in other places

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.590
in Europe and in Asia.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:02.750
And those cities are so much more vibrant,
except for New York City, which is an awesome

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.750
city.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.640
Vanessa: Yeah, I'm sure a lot of students-
Dan: Sorry, U.S.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.940
Vanessa: ... want to visit the U.S. and they
want to see these places.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.120
Dan: But I'm also from America, so it's like
not as-

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.120
Vanessa: It's always less interesting, yeah.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.100
Dan: Yeah, it's less interesting to me.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.910
But Seattle seems like a really cool town,
and it's higher on my list than, say, Los

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.860
Angeles, which just kind of seems like a big,
sprawling, stinky place.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.550
Vanessa: It seems like a lot more-
Dan: No offense, L.A.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.310
Vanessa: It seems a lot more intimidating,
at least.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.310
Dan: Okay, that's a nice way to put it.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.530
Vanessa: Like there's a lot going on there,
but Seattle feels more comfortable.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.910
Dan: Yeah, it seems pretty hip, too.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.050
Vanessa: The Northwest.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:43.090
Dan: Yeah, the Northwest also because there's
big mountains there, and then there's really

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.510
lush and green forests.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.510
Vanessa: Oh.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.510
Okay, cool.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.930
Dan: And I love taking hikes, and if you go
at the right time of the year, because I've

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:55.910
heard it's very rainy in the Pacific Northwest,
I'd like to go and take a nice hike up to

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.390
a big mountain-
Vanessa: Yes.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.240
Dan: ... and maybe hop over to Canada, go
to Vancouver, Vancouver Island.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.620
Vanessa: That'd be cool.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.890
Dan: All of that area sounds really, really
cool to me.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.520
Vanessa: Yeah, I'd be up for that.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.520
Dan: Yes.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520
Vanessa: Let's do it.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520
Dan: Let's do it.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.520
Vanessa: Tomorrow.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.520
Dan: Okay.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.520
Vanessa: Maybe not tomorrow-
Dan: Okay.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.520
Vanessa: ... but I think that'd be really
cool.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.990
Dan: And third would be Colorado.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.110
Vanessa: So revisit Colorado?

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.330
Dan: This is a revisit.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.890
I used to live in Colorado.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:25.860
I grew up there for five years of my life,
and it was when I was a kid, and I used to

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.980
really consider it my home.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.370
But now I haven't been back in probably 15
years, or so.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.822
Vanessa: Oh, that's a long time.

00:20:33.822 --> 00:20:37.750
Dan: It's been a really long time since I've
been back, and I'd like to go and maybe travel

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.840
to where I was when I was a kid.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:45.610
It's gotten so much bigger than it was when
I was a kid, so I'm sure there's so many more

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:46.610
people there.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.970
But also, there's really great nature, there's
a lot of really big mountains in Colorado,

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.690
there's the Garden of the Gods, which has
really interesting rock formations.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.930
As you can tell, we're very nature driven,
we want to go see natural places.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:01.930
Vanessa: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.010
Well, a lot of my places have to do with nature
too.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.010
Dan: Yes, let's hear them.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.380
Vanessa: I almost said the Grand Canyon, but-
Dan: You knew I was going to say it.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.520
Vanessa: ... I kind of figured you'd say,
and I think it would be really cool to camp

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.380
in the Grand Canyon, or go for a long hike
in the Grand Canyon because you can't just-

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.500
Dan: With two children?

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.080
Vanessa: Well, maybe when they're older, or
maybe we'll just leave them at home.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.500
Dan: They can take it.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.761
Vanessa: Because when you are just... when
you're looking down at the Grand Canyon, that's

00:21:26.761 --> 00:21:32.630
incredible, but I imagine going down into
the Grand Canyon, that would also be just

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.680
another part of that-
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.900
We'd have to-
Vanessa: ... it would be so amazing.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.900
Dan: ... hike down in the Grand Canyon.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.900
Vanessa: Yeah, that'd be really cool.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.900
Dan: I should have mentioned that for sure.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.060
Vanessa: Maybe with a donkey.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.100
Dan: Because we're big hikers, we like to
hike everywhere.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.100
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.100
Yeah.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.980
Well, one of my places is kind of the opposite
of yours.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.340
It's not a big city, but you said the Pacific
Northwest, and I said the Northeast.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.670
I've never been to Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
this area.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:04.940
And I feel like one of the best road trips
would be driving all the way up the East Coast

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:10.020
of the U.S., and going around Maine, and coming
down through Vermont.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:15.410
I think all of that geography is just really
different than everywhere else I've visited

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:21.180
in the U.S. I've heard the coasts, like the
Northeast coasts are really rocky, and lots

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.370
of just kind of rugged coastline, that I think
would be really cool to see.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:36.030
And the forests, I've heard the forests in
Vermont are amazing, just a different type

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.030
of feel.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.050
We live in the mountains here in North Carolina,
which is also a great place to visit-

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.050
Dan: Yes.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.050
Vanessa: ... but we already are here.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.050
Dan: We live here.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.390
Vanessa: But I feel like the mountains, and
the forests, and the coast, and other places

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.390
are pretty various.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.140
Dan: Yeah, it's also close to Canada.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.400
Vanessa: Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.481
Dan: Got to hop over to Quebec-
Vanessa: Yeah, maybe do that.

00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:54.040
Dan: ... because that sounds like a really
cool place.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.310
Dan: Vanessa speaks French, so-
Vanessa: That'd be cool.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.710
Dan: ... she'd like to speak some French to
some Quebecois.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.120
Vanessa: That would be fun.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.680
Well, one of my others was kind of similar
to what you were saying with Colorado and

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.080
that area, is going to Yosemite National Park.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.400
I feel like it's just a classic place to visit
in the U.S. because there's so many national

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.620
parks on the West Coast, it's kind of hard
to choose.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.640
So I feel like-
Dan: Yeah, well that one's a must, I think.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.830
Vanessa: Yeah, it's kind of one of the top
three.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.620
Dan: Although I've heard it's gotten crazy
popular.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.620
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.851
Dan: You have to be on lists to get in.

00:23:28.851 --> 00:23:29.920
Vanessa: Whoa, really?

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.850
Dan: Maybe it's to just camp, I don't know.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:32.850
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.450
Dan: Your dad went through a lot of stuff,
didn't he?

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.510
Vanessa: Yeah, when they camped, they had
to...

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:43.550
I think the camping spots were opened, say
like May 3rd, the camping spots were opened

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:48.660
and you had to go online to sign up, and the
website opened... or the camping registration

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:54.510
opened at 6:00 AM, he booked at like 6:05
and there were two spots yet.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.710
Everyone was cramming to camp in that spot.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.710
Dan: Camping season.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.680
Vanessa: So yeah, I guess it's really popular.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.270
And that was for the whole year, that wasn't
just for that day.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.300
That was to book a spot to camp for that whole
year.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.600
Anyway, that's crazy.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.820
So maybe we'll do that.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.770
Maybe we need to book it five years in advance,
but I think it'd be cool to visit national

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:18.800
parks in the west because most tourism, well
there's a lot of city tourism in the U.S.,

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.030
but I feel like a lot of tourism is natural
tourism.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.309
Dan: Yeah, the meat of our tourism is nature.

00:24:24.309 --> 00:24:25.309
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:24:25.309 --> 00:24:31.200
Yeah, because I feel like the U.S. is such
a young country that we don't have Rome, we

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.880
don't have these old cities, and this kind
of stuff you can visit in cities, it's more

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.150
nature, which is also old.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.271
Dan: Except New York City.

00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:40.870
Vanessa: Yeah, except New York's got a lot
of cool stuff.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.640
Dan: As you can tell, I'm a big fan of New
York.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.470
It's just-
Vanessa: It's a cool place to visit.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.500
Dan: ... it's a wild animal.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.500
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.871
Dan: There's some quote about New York City,
it's like, "You'd be crazy to live here, you'd

00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:51.871
be crazy to leave."

00:24:51.871 --> 00:24:52.871
Which is perfect.

00:24:52.871 --> 00:24:58.400
Vanessa: Oh, well I heard another quote that
said, "New York is twice as fun, but it's

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.190
three times as expensive."

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.170
So it's really fun, but it's even more expensive.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.170
Dan: That's also true.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.280
Vanessa: Especially if you live there.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.809
Well, my third and final place is, can you
guess?

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:11.809
Dan: I don't remember.

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:12.809
Vanessa: Hawaii.

00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:14.240
Dan: Oh, I read your list before, but I don't
remember.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.300
Vanessa: Well, I feel like Hawaii, it's in
the U.S., but it's not.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.300
Dan: Yeah.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.830
Vanessa: It's so far away, but it's still
part of the U.S. and it would be incredible

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.870
to visit Hawaii.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.090
Dan: It's kind of like cheating, it's like,
"I'm in the U.S."

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.160
Vanessa: And it's so far away from the U.S.
Dan: But it's like, "This isn't America, come

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160
on."

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.160
Vanessa: Yeah, it would be really cool.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.700
I'm curious, if you've ever been to Hawaii
if you'd recommend it.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.330
I know your parents are planning on going
there next May.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:42.040
Dan: Yeah, and get this, my mom was like,
"And I booked these extra rooms just in case

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.520
somebody wanted to join."

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.840
She winked at us.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.790
Vanessa: We will have a two month old baby
when they go.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.760
Maybe we'll go to Hawaii, I don't know.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.210
It's a little soon, I think.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.140
Dan: I'm saying, "Yes-
Vanessa: We'll let you know.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.140
Dan: ... let's go."

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.140
You'll find out.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.660
Vanessa: I think it'd be really cool to go
to Hawaii, just to see volcanoes, and hiking,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.700
and moving around, and scuba diving, and it's
so different.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.050
Dan: That would be the problem.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.200
Trying to do all we want to do.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.830
But if my parents are there, they can watch
the kids.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:12.110
Vanessa: They can watch our kids, so we're
going to crash their vacation and make them

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.600
watch our kids-
Dan: Yes.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.600
Yes.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.680
Vanessa: ... while we go have fun?

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680
Dan: Vacation crashers.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.790
Vanessa: Sounds great, so I'm curious for
you, what are some locations that you'd like

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.380
to visit in the U.S.? Or maybe somewhere that
you've already been that you'd like to go

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.380
back to.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.380
Let us know.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.781
Let's go on to the next topic.

00:26:27.781 --> 00:26:28.980
The next topic is food.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.070
Dan: Yes.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:34.640
Vanessa: I want to know, what are some of
your favorite foods, specifically to cook

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640
at home?

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.640
Dan: To cook at home?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.640
Well-
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.930
Not to eat, not that someone else makes, but
that we cook at home.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.970
Dan: Yes, usually I go for bulk items.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.970
Vanessa: Okay.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.570
Dan: Not bulk items, bulk meals.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.200
Something that I can get for days, and days,
and days.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.940
Vanessa: Or you could put it in the freezer
and have the next week.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.630
Dan: This is a very, I think, a male way to
think about it.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.660
You've got to make a bulk and make it last.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.170
Vanessa: Ah, utilitarian cooking.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.170
Dan: Yes.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.220
Although, you're kind of similar, I think.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.980
Vanessa: I don't like making a new meal every
single day.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.980
Dan: Yeah.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.800
Vanessa: If we have a soup that's in the freezer
that we made the week before, that's great,

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.150
save some time.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.500
Dan: Sure, yeah.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.760
The first thing I like to make, I think we
have the same one-

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.760
Vanessa: Oh, yeah?

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.760
Dan: ... is chili.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.760
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760
Dan: Yeah, we both like to make chili.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.810
Vanessa: Yeah, some people call this chili
con carne in other countries, but in the U.S.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.870
we just say, "Chili."

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:23.870
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:29.200
Usually I make the chili, so I mean, it's
so easy to make, you just ground up some beef,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.900
then you chop a bunch of vegetables, add a
ton of spices, throw it in a pot and make

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:35.950
it boil, and it's done.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:36.950
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:37.950
Yeah, it's great.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.240
And it gets even better as it kind of melds
those flavors together over a couple days.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240
Dan: Yeah.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:49.179
And you throw in some cheese, and sour cream,
and some kind of grain, some rice or something.

00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:53.300
And yeah, it's always very satisfying, it
reminds me of fall and winter.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.580
It's a very nice, cozy meal.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.890
Hot tip, don't leave it on your counter for
three days and then try to eat it.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.280
It should always go in the fridge after you
eat it.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280
Dan: Who did that?

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.880
Vanessa: Dan did that in college-
Dan: Oh.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880
Vanessa: ... and got sick.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.320
Dan: I didn't leave it on the counter, my
roommate left the chili out.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.390
Vanessa: Oh, and you just ate it?

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.920
Dan: Yeah, he left the pot out.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.020
It was already like, this is college life
here, it was already probably a week old and

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.970
he left it on the counter all day, and he
didn't tell me-

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.970
Vanessa: Not a good idea.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.470
Dan: ... and then I went and ate it that night,
and then I got really sick.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.700
Vanessa: But you still like chili, so it didn't-
Dan: But I still like chili.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.070
Vanessa: ... taint your idea of chili.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.059
Dan: It probably did for like a year.

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:31.059
Vanessa: Really?

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:32.059
Dan: Yeah.

00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:33.059
Yeah.

00:28:33.059 --> 00:28:34.750
Vanessa: I feel like we're especially thinking-
Dan: TMI?

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.320
Vanessa: ... thinking about those types of
foods because it's getting colder here, so

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.850
making lots of warm, hearty foods, as opposed
to in July-

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.850
Dan: Yes.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:46.850
Vanessa: ... we don't make chili because it's
so hot.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.850
Dan: Yeah.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.850
Vanessa: You make other kinds of fresh things.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.390
Dan: I have trouble making summer food, because
I like hot food.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.030
Vanessa: Ah, like soups and that kind of stuff.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.900
Dan: Although, when we lived in South Korea,
I think, didn't they have something where

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.990
they eat something super hot in the summer?

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.180
Vanessa: I think hot or spicy, is that-
Dan: And it's like I'm just eating, and you're

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.180
sweating, and the water's pouring off your
face.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.180
And, "Yeah, this is healthy."

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.880
It's a very Korean thing.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.070
They've got to be diligent.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.070
Vanessa: Wow.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.070
Well, what are some of your other favorite
foods?

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.070
You said chili.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.250
We're on the first one.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.050
Dan: Number two would be tacos.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.050
Vanessa: Oh.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:18.190
Dan: I got a Mexican food thing, I think,
although I don't consider chili a Mexican

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.270
food, but you said chili con carne, so-
Vanessa: Maybe.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.270
Yeah.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.270
Dan: ... I don't know.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.270
Maybe it's Mexican inspired.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.270
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.960
What kind of tacos do you like to make, because
there's so many different types-

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.721
Dan: Ground beef, again, just all the spices,
and it's kind of one of those easy things

00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:37.580
to make, and then you can pile all kinds of
toppings, you can put salsa on it.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.880
Yeah, it's just delicious.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.730
Vanessa: I like when you make fish tacos.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.600
Dan: Yeah, fish tacos are good too.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.200
Vanessa: Sometimes when Dan makes fish tacos,
or sometimes I make them too, we get some

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.380
kind of white fish like cod or tilapia, and
bread it, and then bake it so it's baked,

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:59.080
and then you have some kind of cabbage slaw
mixed up on top with some spices in it, and

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.750
you put that on the tortilla with the fish,
with the kind of spicy cabbage, maybe slices

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.750
of avocado.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.750
Dan: Yeah, and the mayo.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.230
Vanessa: Yeah, some mayo, maybe some-
Dan: Spicy mayo.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.330
Vanessa: ... pico de gallo, some salsa on
top, that's also great.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.040
We make that a lot in the summer, because
that is kind of a fresh type of thing.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.220
Dan: Yeah, well speaking of fish-
Vanessa: Yes?

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.410
Dan: ... my third would be salmon.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.370
Vanessa: Oh, how do you like to make salmon?

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.740
Dan: Well, I think you can make it in a lot
of different ways, but just throw it in the

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:29.490
oven with some... like lately we've been adding
lemon slices and dill, and just keeping it

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.490
basic.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.710
Vanessa: Sometimes we put-
Dan: Oh, and butter.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:32.710
Vanessa: Oh, butter.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:33.710
Of course, butter.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.710
Dan: That's important.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.910
Vanessa: Sometimes we do it in the opposite
way with soy sauce, and sesame oil, kind of

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:38.910
more-
Dan: You do it that way.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.910
Vanessa: ... Asian style.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:40.910
Dan: Yeah.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.830
Vanessa: And that's also great with rice,
or some kind of veggie.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.410
Dan: I do it more European style.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.250
Vanessa: Yeah, well I think you can't go wrong
with salmon.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:50.710
Dan: Yeah, but it's just a very healthy meal
that tastes very filling, and fulfilling.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:54.150
Vanessa: Yeah, I think your answers have been
much more varied than mine.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.150
Dan: Oh, yeah?

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.440
Vanessa: Because I was going to say soup,
soup, and soup.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.440
Dan: Oh.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.040
Vanessa: I think that, especially now because
it's the begging of the winter, those are

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.770
the types of things that we like to eat.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:11.500
But recently, I've been making a lot of butternut
squash soup, and it's a type of squash, and

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:17.030
you just peel it, and then you chop it up,
and you steam it with some cumin, and paprika,

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:22.130
and coconut milk, and red peppers-
Dan: It's a nice appetizer.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:27.590
Vanessa: ... and you can also maybe dip some
bread in it's mixed together, because you

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.830
have to blend it.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:29.830
It's really great.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.270
It feels kind of cleansing, especially if
you've eaten-

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.900
Dan: It's not filling enough to me.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.330
Vanessa: It's nice to have with something
else sometimes.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.760
Dan: I need some meat in my life.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.029
Vanessa: Typical answer, right?

00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:44.540
I think we also made a really great, it's
called Italian vegetable soup, but I don't

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.559
know if it's actually Italian, I don't know
why it's considered Italian.

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.130
Dan: It's probably Italian American.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.130
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.110
Dan: Everything American's say is Italian,
I bet you every Italian out there is like,

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.620
"That is not Italian."

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.340
Vanessa: Yeah, that-
Dan: "What is this?"

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.179
Vanessa: That is not-
Dan: Is that Italian?

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:03.700
Vanessa: ... an Italian accent, but that's
okay.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.700
Dan: Zut alors.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.830
Vanessa: That is-
Dan: Oh, that's French.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.340
Vanessa: Yeah, certainly not Italian.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:12.741
Though when we make the Italian vegetable
soup, it's basically every vegetable you can

00:32:12.741 --> 00:32:20.540
imagine mixed in a pot, even with some tomatoes,
and cabbage, and everything, peppers, and

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.920
everything mixed together, and some ground
beef.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:28.710
So it kind of has a hearty, beefy flavor,
but it also has a lot of vegetables so it

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.970
feels healthy and filling with some nice bread
to dip it in.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:33.970
Dan: It was very good.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:34.970
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:38.420
Dan: Although, I will say that you can probably
tell from this conversation that we are not

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.420
chefs.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.420
Vanessa: No.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.179
Dan: We don't prepare like really good meals
very often.

00:32:43.179 --> 00:32:44.179
Vanessa: Or something that's fancy.

00:32:44.179 --> 00:32:48.840
Dan: They're delicious, but they're not...
they don't have, you know, what's a sous vide,

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840
or something.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.200
Vanessa: Oh, something that's really exciting.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.200
Dan: Yeah.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.020
Vanessa: Well-
Dan: Although I did make risotto, that was

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.020
really good.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.020
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.020
You've made risotto a lot.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.540
Dan: I made some really good risotto, and
I felt like it took a lot of work, and that

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.540
was fun.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.220
Vanessa: I think it took some particular attention
to detail and I won't do that.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:10.020
Dan: You know, you use lemon zest, any time
you use lemon zest, I feel like you're probably

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.360
crossing over to chef territory.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.450
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.190
Well, you have crossed over into chef territory
a few times.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.660
I remain clearly on the other side, just happily
eating whatever you make.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:24.070
But I'm curious for you, what are some of
your favorite foods to eat at home?

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.760
What are some of your favorite foods to make
at home?

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.820
Maybe it's something that comes from your
country, or maybe it's just something that

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.860
you like to make, like toast, something simple.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.860
Let us know.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.860
Dan: Toast.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.860
Vanessa: Yes.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.340
All right, let's go to the next topic.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.929
The next topic is housing.

00:33:39.929 --> 00:33:46.220
I want you to dream big, if you could have
your dream home, what three features would

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.220
it have?

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:52.220
Let's say this is a dream home, this is idealistic,
this is not realistic.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.430
Dan: This is probably not going to happen
to us.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.480
Vanessa: No, but it's just a dream.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480
Everyone can dream, right?

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480
Dan: Yeah.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.140
Vanessa: What would you ideally love to have?

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.140
Dan: A palace.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.340
A castle.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.049
Vanessa: Hopefully you can hire some people
to clean it at that point.

00:34:05.049 --> 00:34:06.450
Dan: Okay, not really.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.010
So the features of the home?

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.950
Vanessa: Yes, what three features would you
love to have if you could dream and build

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.139
your own home?

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:15.139
Dan: Okay.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:20.520
Well, first, I would want the living room,
and I don't know is a living common in other

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520
countries?

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.520
Vanessa: Yeah, a place where you have a couch,
and maybe a TV.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.360
Dan: This is where you gather together, where
you have the couch, and where you visit with

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360
friends.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:33.040
I would like this room to be humongous, and
have a really large window.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.940
Vanessa: Are we talking soccer field size
humongous, or are we talking like twice as

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.940
big as a normal one?

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.110
Dan: I'm talking football stadium big.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.110
Vanessa: Okay.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.110
Dan: No, not really.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.110
Just large.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.350
Large ceilings, vaulted ceilings as they say
in the industry.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.350
Vanessa: Okay.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.830
Dan: And a very large window.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:50.830
Vanessa: Okay.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:51.830
Dan: Or large windows.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.830
Vanessa: I said the same thing.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.010
I would like a main room with a big window.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.010
Dan: Yes, but there's more.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.010
Vanessa: Okay.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.369
Dan: And it needs a great view, an incredible
view.

00:34:58.369 --> 00:35:00.100
Vanessa: Oh, what's a good view for you?

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.100
What would be an ideal view?

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.810
Dan: I really love looking out at the ocean,
that would be great.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:10.630
I'm not a big fan of where I live on the East
Coast of America, the beaches are all kind

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.630
of the same to me.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.050
They're not my favorite.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.850
This would be in the Mediterranean, on a big
cliff.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.530
Vanessa: Oh, so it wouldn't be-
Dan: Yeah, a cliff side home.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.150
Vanessa: ... in the U.S., okay.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.690
Dan: Yeah, it wouldn't be in the U.S., sorry
U.S.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:24.630
Well, maybe somewhere in the U.S. I don't
know.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:27.210
Vanessa: Could be Pacific Northwest, you've
never been there.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.210
You don't know.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.270
Dan: It may be the Pacific Northwest, maybe
that's my kind of ocean view.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.740
Vanessa: Yeah, so you'd like an ocean view?

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.530
Dan: It'd be really high.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.840
Looking down on my kingdom.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.640
Vanessa: So you'd need to be a king too?

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.461
Dan: I have to be a king in this scenario.

00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:39.750
Vanessa: This is getting a little excessive.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.260
Dan: So yeah, a really big, open ocean view.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.619
Remember, this is dreaming.

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:45.619
Vanessa: This is dreaming.

00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:46.619
All right, keep dreaming.

00:35:46.619 --> 00:35:47.619
What else would you like?

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:52.150
Dan: All right, so it's very open, so close
by would be a very epic, open kitchen.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.490
Vanessa: Oh, so open you mean it's connected
to the living space?

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.950
Dan: Yeah, this is popular, I think, nowadays
in architecture.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:58.950
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.300
Dan: Yeah, so open to the living room.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.980
Vanessa: So as you're cooking-
Dan: At least-

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.050
Vanessa: ... you can still talk to your guests.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.800
Dan: Yeah, at least part of the kitchen would
be visible.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.890
Vanessa: Yeah, so at the moment, our kitchen
is open to the living room.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.010
Dan: Yes, we have this now.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.890
Vanessa: We don't have an epic, giant-
Dan: Except for the view.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.090
Vanessa: ... living room with a view of the
Mediterranean.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.090
Dan: And the big kitchen.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.310
Vanessa: Yes, but we have an open space, so
it's kind of like one room.

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:26.260
Our kitchen is connected to our living space,
so when our guests, or our friends, or our

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:31.290
family, or our kids are in the living space,
the living room, we can see them and still

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.290
kind of interact.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:39.480
So this type of layout is pretty popular,
at least in newer houses, or as people remodel

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.100
their houses, they're kind of looking for
this open layout, is what it's called.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.550
Dan: Yeah, it's called an open floor plan.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.570
Vanessa: Open floor plan, that's the word.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.570
Yeah.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.570
So anything else you would like in this amazing
house?

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.510
Dan: Yes, there's one more thing in my palace.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.010
Vanessa: Okay, in your kingdom.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.680
Dan: In my kingdom.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.470
So there would be a game room, because I love
games a lot.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:00.470
Vanessa: Okay, what kind of games?

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:01.470
Dan: All kinds of games.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.850
So we actually rented a place like this that
was very similar.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.690
Vanessa: Oh, like your grandparents rented
that beach house.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:07.690
Dan: Actually my grandma rented it.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.820
It was a beach house, so it was like four
layers of house.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.820
Vanessa: That's crazy.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.820
Dan: It was humongous.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.820
It was called The Ritz-
Vanessa: Of course.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.990
Dan: ... which is like a fancy thing.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:22.940
So the very top floor of this building was
just this giant game room.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.450
They had a pool table, they had a-
Vanessa: A ping-pong.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.010
Dan: Oh, that was... the ping-pong table was
somewhere else.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.350
But in palace, the ping-pong table would be
in the same room.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.750
Vanessa: So ping-pong, foosball, pool.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.490
Dan: Other games too, chess, yeah.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:35.790
Vanessa: Oh, board game cabinets.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.869
Dan: There would be all kinds of games.

00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:41.640
There'd be a TV with video games, it'd just
be fun everywhere.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.140
Vanessa: Okay, so you want a whole big room?

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.590
Dan: And then I'd have to lock it up so I
didn't go in, because I'd spend all my time

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.590
in there.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:51.180
Vanessa: Okay, so you'd have to request the
key from one of the people?

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.180
Dan: You.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.180
Vanessa: From me?

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.180
Okay.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.180
Dan: "Gate keeper, let me in the game room."

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.881
Vanessa: I'm sorry to say, but in my dream
home-

00:37:57.881 --> 00:37:59.070
Dan: There's no game room?

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.930
Vanessa: ... there is not a game room, although
it's a fun idea.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:03.930
It's a good idea.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.290
Dan: Save that for the vacation home?

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:10.460
Vanessa: Yeah, that's good if your grandparents
rent a house for a week and invite all the

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.460
family.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.460
Dan: Yes, it was perfect for that.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.240
Vanessa: That's a good thing to have, but
maybe not in my forever house.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.050
Dan: Okay, what's your forever dream home
look like?

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.100
Vanessa: Well, I did say I'd like a main room
with a big window.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.700
I think that would be really great.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.290
So we have some-
Dan: But what's your ideal view?

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.630
Vanessa: I didn't really say.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:33.000
I feel like it doesn't have to be the beach,
maybe not someone else's house right there,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.609
but it could be the mountains, that would
be nice.

00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:35.609
Dan: Sure.

00:38:35.609 --> 00:38:37.280
Vanessa: But I also like-
Dan: Any kind of picturesque view.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.090
Vanessa: ... I don't like to be isolated,
so if you have a beautiful mountain view,

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.910
that means you probably live in the middle
of the mountains away from everybody.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:46.910
Dan: It's true.

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:50.250
Vanessa: So I don't mind if the view's not
perfect, but I'd just like to have a big window

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.270
with lots of light, that'd be really great.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:59.320
The other thing that I said is a little more
practical, and that is a huge studio room

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.060
with different walls that I can film on.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.119
Dan: Very practical for the Fearless Fluency
Club.

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:06.119
Vanessa: Yes.

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:07.119
Dan: Oh, wait, and for YouTube.

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:08.119
Vanessa: Yes.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:12.670
So for, of course, the fearless fluency club,
and also for YouTube, having different locations

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.370
where I can easily film.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:19.490
And the room where we often film videos, in
here, it's okay.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.580
It's not super small, but I have an image
of-

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.720
Dan: It's pretty small.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.970
Vanessa: ... four different walls with different
backgrounds and different things that I can

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:33.710
move lights and easily have different locations
to film, I think that would be really cool.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:37.530
So I'm starting out small, we have this room,
and then maybe someday in my dream home.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.760
Dan: Yeah, this is way better than our other
house.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.730
Vanessa: Oh, yeah, where we used to live in
the apartment.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:42.900
Dan: She used to film in a closet.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.010
Vanessa: It wasn't a closet, but it was really
small.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.140
Dan: Two closets combined.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.640
Vanessa: Yeah, it was like a little triangle
room.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.640
Dan: It was very small.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.990
Vanessa: But-
Dan: Hey, we made it work.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.990
Vanessa: Yeah, it worked.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.990
We made it work.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:59.100
And the other feature that I would like is,
in a dream home, is a roof deck.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.100
Dan: That's cool.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.380
Vanessa: Yeah, so some stairs, and then a
little roof-

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.440
Dan: This is the adventurer in Vanessa speaking.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.310
Vanessa: ... on the top so you can look down
everywhere.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.310
Dan: But that's in my house, too.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.380
Vanessa: Oh, it's in your house?

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.380
Oh, good.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.099
Maybe we can have a house together.

00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:14.390
And also at night you could lay up there and
see the stars.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.230
I think that would be really cool-
Dan: Yeah, that would be neat.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.530
Vanessa: ... so you could have a perfect place
to stargaze.

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.310
Dan: I don't know why more houses don't have
this.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.590
Vanessa: Yeah, we should put a deck on top
of our house.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.590
Dan: Yeah, why not?

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:23.590
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.990
Dan: Maybe some architect out there has a
reason.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.340
"Well, actually it's bad for structural integrity."

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.160
Vanessa: I think that people just don't value
stargazing like we do.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.160
Dan: Maybe.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.349
Vanessa: It's really cool to see the stars
at night, and especially if you're... if you

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:39.510
just have a perfect view from a rooftop deck.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.310
Dan: You're perched in a high place.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.000
Vanessa: Yeah, that'd be really cool.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Well, it was nice to dream.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Thanks for dreaming with me.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Dan: Yeah.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Oh, dream's over.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.330
I'm curious for you, if you could have your
dream home, what features would you like in

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.330
that home?

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.530
All right, let's go to the next topic.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.849
The next topic is nature.

00:40:54.849 --> 00:40:55.849
Dan: Nature.

00:40:55.849 --> 00:41:01.099
Vanessa: I want to know what are two cool
facts about animals or nature?

00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:02.920
Dan: You want to know two facts?

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.510
Vanessa: Yeah, so we did a little bit of research
before this, because we love watching animal

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.510
documentaries.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.440
Dan: Okay, well I have a story behind my first
factoid.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.770
Vanessa: Okay.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:19.130
Dan: One time I was talking to my mom, I don't
remember how this came up, but we were talking

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.130
about turtles.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:24.590
And I don't know why we were talking about
turtles, but she said, "Did you know that

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.410
turtles breathe through their butts?"

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:28.830
My mom said this.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:33.681
And we, for days, we were like, "Mom, turtles...
where did you hear that?

00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:35.480
That is so-
Vanessa: Were you a kid?

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.070
Dan: That was like, no, I was older.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.070
Vanessa: Okay.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.070
Dan: Probably a teenager, I guess.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.070
Vanessa: Okay.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.849
Dan: But we, me and my siblings, we all just
made fun of her.

00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:45.700
We were like, "Mom, you just made that up.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.460
Where on Earth did you hear that?"

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.110
But really, it's actually true.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.670
A turtle can breathe through its butt.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.670
Vanessa: What?

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:55.670
Dan: It's true.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.670
Vanessa: Wait, why do they do this?

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.130
Dan: Okay, so it's when they're hibernating.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:03.440
I looked it up to verify because I remember
hearing that that actually was true.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:09.050
So in the winter, it gets really cold, obviously,
and they live under water.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:14.410
So it's like really cold, it's almost freezing,
and they can't use their lungs.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:22.020
So they basically suck water up their butts,
and the water gives them oxygen, therefore-

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.150
Vanessa: Oh, why?

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.380
Dan: ... they breathe through their butts
in the winter when they're hibernating.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.820
Vanessa: Wow, and your mom was right.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.750
Dan: So my mom was right, but we just... we
did not believe her when she said that.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.830
Vanessa: I mean, it's really bizarre, so why
would you believe her?

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:34.830
Dan: Yeah.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.040
Also, it was very random of her.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.670
She was like, "Don't turtles breathe through
their butts?"

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.790
Vanessa: And we were like, "Mom, you just
made that up.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.790
There's no way."

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.790
Dan: But it's true.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:44.790
Vanessa: But it's true.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.880
Dan: So this is turtles who specifically live
in the water?

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.890
Not box turtles, or those types of things.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:48.890
Vanessa: No.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.620
Yeah, turtles but not ocean turtles either.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.050
Dan: Okay, so just ones that live in fresh
water-

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.050
Vanessa: Yes.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.050
Dan: ... and live in the water?

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.050
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.050
Dan: This is a very... yeah, tell your friends.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.050
Vanessa: Oh.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.050
Dan: Turtles breathe through their butts.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.540
Vanessa: Before you get to your second fact,
I'm going to share one of mine-

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.540
Dan: Okay.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.290
Vanessa: ... which is amazing about butterflies
and caterpillars.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.460
We recently-
Dan: We're like a nature documentary now.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.400
Vanessa: Well, I included this because-
Dan: Should we talk like David Attenborough?

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.670
Vanessa: I feel really nerdy about animals.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:15.900
Dan: "The beautiful butterflies."

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.910
Vanessa: Yeah, if you've ever seen nature
documentaries by BBC, David Attenborough is

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.730
one of the main commentators.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:28.490
He's been a staple of nature documentaries
for over a decade, two decades, three decades

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:29.850
maybe, the '70s.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:34.869
So we are big fans of him and his work, but
I included this topic because we're nerdy

00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:38.910
about animals and nature, and like that stuff,
and I thought it would be fun to talk about.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:39.910
Dan: Sure.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:45.780
Vanessa: Well, a couple months ago, we found
four monarch butterfly caterpillars in our

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.090
backyard.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.911
And they didn't look so good, they looked
like they needed a little bit of help, so

00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:58.970
we gave them some milkweed leaves, which is
what monarch butterflies eat, or monarch caterpillars

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:03.390
eat, and we put them in this... we have a
butterfly net, it's like a little container

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.330
where you can grow butterflies.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.580
Dan: Grow and release.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.580
Vanessa: Yes.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:13.510
And so we put the caterpillars in there, gave
them a lot of leaves, and they turned into

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.470
cocoons.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:20.191
Then two of them died, but two of them became
butterflies, it was really amazing, so that

00:44:20.191 --> 00:44:23.530
kind of sparked my interest in learning more
about that.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:29.240
We kind of all know caterpillars become butterflies,
but did you know that a caterpillar, when

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.590
it creates a cocoon, it will liquefy it's
body.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:40.180
It's like a soup inside the cocoon, and it
is digesting, it's eating itself inside the

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.850
cocoon, and its DNA just kind of mixes around
and becomes a butterfly.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.790
Dan: Yeah, so it's not like wrapping a blanket
around itself.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:49.790
Vanessa: No.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.790
Dan: Because-
Vanessa: It's crazy.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:55.630
Dan: ... usually when I thought of a cocoon,
you would think that the caterpillar spins

00:44:55.630 --> 00:45:01.700
something around itself, but no, it's literally
liquefying its body on the inside, and then

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.260
turning into, I believe the technical term
is a pupa.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.599
Vanessa: A pupa.

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:14.119
Yeah, so inside when it actually makes that
cocoon, so we saw this happen, where the cocoon

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:20.619
pops out of the caterpillars body, and the
skin and the head pop off, and they fall onto

00:45:20.619 --> 00:45:22.580
the ground because-
Dan: It's kind of like a Halloween story.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:23.580
Vanessa: It is.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.580
It's pretty horrific, if you think about it.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.869
Dan: It was almost Halloween.

00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:31.480
Vanessa: And inside the cocoon is the liquefied
soup of the butterfly.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.900
Dan: And it's body liquefied and it turned
into a terrible creature.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.510
Vanessa: How did nature-
Dan: A butterfly.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.790
Vanessa: ... think that this would work?

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.020
But it does, it's amazing.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.020
Wow.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.020
So, that's my first cool fact about nature.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.310
Dan: Cool nature factoid.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.310
Vanessa: Yes.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:46.310
Caterpillar soup.

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.310
Dan: All right.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.890
My second is about the noble albatross.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:50.890
Vanessa: Albatross are so cool.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:56.150
Dan: Although if you say something is an albatross,
that kind of means it's a bad thing, or like

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:57.150
a burden.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:58.359
It's like a saying.

00:45:58.359 --> 00:46:01.130
Vanessa: Ah, that's kind of like an old fashioned
expression.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:02.130
But-
Dan: Yeah.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.000
But anyways, my factoid is-
Vanessa: ... it is a bird.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.440
Dan: ... an albatross has the longest wingspan
of any bird.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.440
Did you know that?

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.090
Almost 12 feet long, or 3.2 meters.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.210
Vanessa: Three meters?

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.700
Dan: Something like that.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.480
Vanessa: Three meters is so long, so that
means from the tip of one wing to the tip

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.880
of the other wing is three meters, 12 feet.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.800
Dan: Yeah, it's a really huge bird.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.800
Vanessa: One bird.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.530
Dan: And actually, if you've watched any David
Attenborough documentaries-

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:29.530
Vanessa: Or others.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:34.830
Dan: ... we watched one with the albatross,
it needs to take a really long run before

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:38.109
it flies, because its wings are so huge-
Vanessa: Like a huge airplane, it needs a

00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:39.670
lot of runway to get off.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.540
Dan: But there's a lot of other animals.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.550
What was it in the documentary that was trying
to get them?

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:44.550
Vanessa: It was the babies.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:45.550
Dan: Oh, sharks.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.550
Vanessa: Yes.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:47.550
Dan: Because they would crash in the water
and the sharks would eat them.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:52.849
Vanessa: When the babies were first learning
how to fly, a lot of them crash in the water,

00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:57.290
and I think they do it the same time every
year, so sharks gather there-

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:58.560
Dan: They wait for the babies.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.510
Vanessa: ... and as the babies are learning
to fly, if they fail on their first try, that's

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:03.510
it.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.510
Dan: Yeah, they can't make it.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.430
Vanessa: Anyway, that was a really sad part
of the documentary.

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:11.990
Dan: But once they actually get in the air,
an albatross can stay in the air for up to

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:15.859
10,000 miles, which is a lot of kilometers.

00:47:15.859 --> 00:47:17.420
Vanessa: 6,000, 7,000 kilometers?

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:22.119
Dan: Yeah, I'm not so good with those conversions
that everybody else uses.

00:47:22.119 --> 00:47:26.330
Vanessa: Yeah, and I remember you also told
me that they could fly for-

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.500
Dan: A day.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.050
Vanessa: ... a whole day with just one [inaudible
00:47:30].

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.339
Dan: Just one flap of their wings.

00:47:31.339 --> 00:47:34.750
Vanessa: If they have the right wind, because
they go off into the ocean.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:35.750
Dan: Yeah, it requires good wind.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:36.750
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:37.750
Dan: Because they just use the wind to bounce
up and down.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.430
Vanessa: So they only need to flap their wings
one time per day, if there is good wind.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.450
Dan: It'd be a very lonely existence, just
flying over the ocean.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:49.570
Vanessa: But talking about lonely, they also
mate for life.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:50.580
Dan: That's lonely?

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.050
Vanessa: Well, no, that's crazy because they...

00:47:54.050 --> 00:48:01.470
most birds are not like that, so they go off
alone into the ocean to hunt, and then once

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:09.020
a year they come back to the same place and
they hope that their husband or wife, their

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.870
mate, has survived also.

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:12.750
Dan: And then they promptly cheat on them.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.830
Vanessa: Well, they are not monogamous.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:20.300
Dan: They have partners that they regularly
come back to, but then they also go and flirt

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.300
with other birds.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:26.270
Vanessa: Other birds as well, but they have
the same main partner for their whole lives,

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:30.910
and they only see them once a year, but they
find each other at that same... on the same

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.099
rock, on the same land, every... albatross
are really cool.

00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:35.099
Dan: [crosstalk 00:48:34] kisses.

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:36.099
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:38.720
Yeah, you should look up some videos about
albatross, they're really cool.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.320
Well, one of my other cool facts-
Dan: What's your last factoid?

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.630
Vanessa: ... my last cool fact is about a
mantis shrimp.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.660
Dan: The mantis shrimp.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:51.890
Vanessa: We think about shrimp as the thing
that we eat, but the mantis shrimp is really

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:52.890
different.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:53.990
I'll show you a picture here.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:57.660
The mantis shrimp is an insane animal.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:04.310
It has the best visual senses of any animal,
including humans.

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:06.900
I looked this up to make sure I could explain
it correctly.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.810
Humans have three photoreceptors in our eyes.

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.890
How many do you think the mantis shrimp have?

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.280
Dan: 10.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.160
Vanessa: 12 to 16.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.880
So this means they can see infrared, they
can see ultraviolet, they can see every possible

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.450
thing that's coming through the light spectrum.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.450
It is crazy.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:31.460
Dan: Basically thank god it's not huge and
lives on land, because it would kill us.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.880
Vanessa: Yes, this and it can also punch through,
it has the-

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.339
Dan: Look how it's hand's like this.

00:49:37.339 --> 00:49:38.990
Vanessa: Yes, they're like this.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:45.020
It can punch through bulletproof glass that
is 1 centimeter thick.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:49.280
So it's almost impossible to keep a mantis
shrimp in an aquarium because-

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.280
Dan: Because it will break the glass.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.640
Vanessa: ... they're so strong... it's just
a shrimp, they're small, but it can punch

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.060
through bullet proof glass, and most aquariums
don't have bullet proof glass, it's less than

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.060
that.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.060
Dan: Why not?

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:05.380
Vanessa: But it will punch through the glass
and get out, so they can see everything, and

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.940
they also can punch through the glass, which
is absolutely insane.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.550
There's a lot of really cool videos-
Dan: And they look cool too.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:12.770
Vanessa: Yeah, colors, and their big eyes.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:13.770
Dan: Yeah, beautiful.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:16.670
You should share the comic about it too.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:19.430
There's a popular comic in America called
The Oatmeal.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:20.450
Vanessa: It's a website.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.730
Dan: Yeah, it's a website.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:24.560
And they have a whole story about the mantis
shrimp.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.380
Vanessa: Yeah, there's a good YouTube video
too, about the mantis shrimp.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.380
Dan: About it?

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.380
Oh.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.340
Vanessa: I think it's... who's that guy who
does kind of funny stuff about animals who's

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.700
like, "That's how the mantis shrimp do."

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.700
Dan: Oh, zefrank.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.700
Vanessa: Zefrank, yes.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.070
Dan: Look up zefrank for a good laugh.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:42.810
Vanessa: Just look up mantis shrimp on YouTube,
you'll find many great things because those

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:43.810
animals are cool.

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:47.410
All right, we had a chance to be nerdy, let's
go on to the next topic, and I want to know

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:49.240
for you, do you know any cool animal facts?

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.240
Dan: Yeah.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.491
Vanessa: All right, let's go to the next topic.

00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:55.270
The next topic is holidays.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:51:00.510
And it is the end of November-ish, which is
Thanksgiving time in the U.S., so I want to

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:04.740
know, in your experience, what is Thanksgiving
like in the U.S.?

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.330
Dan: In the U.S., well it's pretty much just
an American holiday, right?

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:08.330
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:09.520
Dan: Or Canadian, I suppose.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.080
Vanessa: Canada also has Thanksgiving.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.320
Dan: So for Thanksgiving, the primary thing
that we do is eat food.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.610
Vanessa: Okay, next topic.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:17.610
Dan: The end.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.530
Vanessa: Oh, yeah, it's pretty much all about
food.

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:22.060
Dan: It's really all about the food, especially
turkey.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:26.060
Vanessa: So tell us about food on Thanksgiving.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.099
Dan: Pretty much everybody gets a turkey.

00:51:28.099 --> 00:51:29.099
Vanessa: A big, full turkey.

00:51:29.099 --> 00:51:34.470
Dan: Yeah, there must be this huge spike in
turkey sales in November in the U.S.

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:35.470
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:38.980
Dan: But everybody gets a turkey, you cook
the whole turkey, and you get gravy, and you

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:44.010
pour it on there, and there's something called
stuffing as well, which is this bread pudding

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:45.010
kind of thing, I guess.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:49.800
Vanessa: Yeah, well, you have it inside the
turkey, usually you cook some seasonings,

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.110
and lemons, and breads, and all different
types of things inside the turkey.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.810
Dan: Some may argue that the stuffing is better
than the turkey.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:58.810
Vanessa: Yeah, sometimes it is.

00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:00.204
Dan: I'm one of those people-
Vanessa: Stuff is great.

00:52:00.204 --> 00:52:01.400
Dan: ... I just eat the stuffing.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.480
Vanessa: It's really full of turkey juices,
so it's kind of like a breaded mixture, I'll

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.810
try to share a picture, but stuffing, turkey.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:13.540
Dan: So the holiday is really just centered
around the meal, and then you invite lots

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.540
of family over.

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.540
Vanessa: Yes.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:19.330
Dan: And usually one family member will host
a lot of family, I find.

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.330
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.010
Dan: And sometimes friends as well, but like
your dad has been doing friends for the last

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.010
few years.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:26.010
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:27.010
Dan: But traditionally, it's only family.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:31.180
Vanessa: Yeah, I think this is definitely
more a family holiday, that you say goodbye

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:35.730
to your friends, go back home wherever you
came from, if you live far away from your

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.720
parents, maybe you'll go back home and have
Thanksgiving at their home, or maybe they'll

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720
come visit you.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:44.010
It's kind of a time for families to come back
together during Thanksgiving.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:45.010
Dan: Yeah.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:50.430
And if you are a very bonded family, then
you always say what you're thankful for.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.430
Vanessa: Oh.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:55.330
Dan: So every year my family would always
say something they're thankful for around

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:56.330
the table.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:00.470
And usually when I was a kid I remember being
like-

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:01.470
Vanessa: "I don't want to do this."

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:04.720
Dan: "I don't want..." but now I'm like, "I'm
thankful for everybody and everything in my

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.720
family.

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720
It's so beautiful."

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.710
Get a little more sentimental when you get
older.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:10.710
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:15.790
Well, back to the food, we're kind of talking
about the traditions now, but back to the

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:20.610
food, the typical things are a big turkey
bird, a full bird, you don't have just slices

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.050
of turkey, you have the full bird and then
you cut it up.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:24.050
Dan: Yeah.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:28.849
Vanessa: And then stuffing, green beans is
common with gravy, mashed potatoes, sweet

00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:33.990
potatoes, in the south of the U.S., sweet
potato casserole is really big.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.680
This is insane-
Dan: With brown sugar on it.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.980
Vanessa: ... it's insanely sweet because it's
sweet potatoes, which are orange and already

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.640
pretty sweet naturally, then brown sugar,
and then-

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.640
Dan: Marshmallows, right?

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.890
Vanessa: ... marshmallows, for dinner.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.490
Dan: Oh, I forgot about that.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:51.990
Vanessa: Crazy, but-
Dan: I always eat like this much of that because

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.990
it's too sweet.

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:56.640
Vanessa: It's really rich, but that's kind
of a southern thing, and you also always have

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.730
cranberry sauce.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:58.790
Dan: Right.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:05.030
Vanessa: This is... a cranberry is a really
tart berry, it's so tart, it's really sour,

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:07.460
but when you mix it with a lot of sugar, it's
great.

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.460
Dan: And you need mashed potatoes.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:13.470
Vanessa: Yeah, so the cranberries, and the
mashed potatoes, and the turkey, it's a perfect

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:14.470
combination.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:18.260
That kind of tart flavors with the mashed
potatoes with the turkey, it kind of mixes

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.260
together really great.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.089
Dan: Yeah, basically the point is to eat so
much you can barely move at the end of the

00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:24.089
day.

00:54:24.089 --> 00:54:29.010
Vanessa: Well, they do say that turkey, the
bird, the turkey meat, has some kind of-

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:30.010
Dan: Tryptophan.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:31.010
Vanessa: Is that what it's called?

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:32.010
Dan: I think so.

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:34.280
Vanessa: That kind of enzyme in it.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.280
Isn't it enzyme?

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.280
Hormone, or-
Dan: Chemical?

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.599
Vanessa: It has something in the meat naturally
that makes you feel sleepy, so at Thanksgiving

00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:46.609
that's really one of the only times when we
eat turkey, so because we eat so much turkey,

00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:52.430
it's kind of stereotypical to say after the
Thanksgiving meal everyone crashes on the

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.359
couch and watches football.

00:54:54.359 --> 00:54:57.080
So it's kind of a tradition.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:00.430
Dan: Yeah, football is probably the most American
aspect of this.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.430
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:02.810
Dan: They don't really play football in other
countries, do they?

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:03.869
Vanessa: Well, this is American football.

00:55:03.869 --> 00:55:05.560
Dan: I mean, not... yeah, not-
Vanessa: American football.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.950
Dan: ... real football, like you know, not
kicking the ball.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:08.950
Vanessa: Soccer.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:11.680
Dan: Football like, we throw the ball, and
we tackle each other, and stuff.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.869
Vanessa: Yeah, so there are... there's always
a football, an American football game on Thanksgiving,

00:55:16.869 --> 00:55:23.410
so that's why some of the sayings abut Thanksgiving
is the three Fs, family, food, football.

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:29.359
When I was growing up, my family would eat
Thanksgiving, and then we often would go to

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:34.190
the living room and watch football together,
even though we weren't big football fans.

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:35.290
It's kind of just-
Dan: It's just tradition.

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:36.850
Vanessa: ... what you do.

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:40.740
So we would say what we were thankful for,
and then-

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.740
Dan: It's the American religion.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.350
Vanessa: ... watch football, and that was
just kind of a family time together.

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:45.360
I don't know.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.670
Did you guys ever do anything?

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:48.130
Sometimes we threw a football in backyard.

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:50.890
Dan: Yeah, a few years we would throw the
football.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:52.840
Our family didn't watch that much football.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.920
Vanessa: Yeah-
Dan: We would sometimes, just like the Superbowl,

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.920
that's all.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:04.380
Yeah, so I'm curious, for you, in your country,
do you have any fall meal holiday that's really

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.859
centered around food?

00:56:05.859 --> 00:56:10.570
Dan: Yeah, we should also say, I think it's
supposed to also traditionally be you feast

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.200
on all the food that you grew.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.700
Vanessa: Yeah, but most people are not farmers
nowadays.

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:19.210
Dan: Yeah, but I think traditionally it does
have that element of, "The harvest is in.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.160
We come and eat all this delicious food.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.160
It was a good year."

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.860
Vanessa: "We're thankful for the good harvest."

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:24.960
Dan: "We're thankful for the good harvest."

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.460
So maybe a lot of countries have something
like that.

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.460
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.460
All right.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.460
Let's go to the next topic.

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.940
The next topic is relaxation.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:39.560
I want to know, if I were feeling stressed,
what tips would you give me to help me feel

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.560
relaxed?

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.710
Dan: If you were feeling stressed?

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:42.710
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:48.980
Dan: Well, I don't know if this would work
for everyone, but I find that playing a sport,

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:55.940
or doing something active that requires some
concentration, really helps me not be stressed,

00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:01.849
like if I'm concerned about something I like
to go and maybe play some basketball, where

00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:06.360
your only goal is to put the ball in the hoop,
it's just something very simple and you're

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:12.849
using your body, which is different from how
a lot of people live today, which is very

00:57:12.849 --> 00:57:17.960
stationary and thinking about all kinds of
problems and then looking at your phone and

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.710
reading about more problems.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.490
Everything's a big problem it seems like.

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:26.350
Vanessa: So if you get out and move your body-
Dan: So if you get out and you move your body-

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:27.350
Vanessa: ... in the real world, yeah.

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:29.370
Dan: Yeah, and it could just be a hike, a
hike or something.

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:30.370
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:34.330
Dan: But yeah, I like to go and play basketball,
or maybe play some hockey, I like to do that

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.839
too, just shoot the puck around, it's a lot
of fun.

00:57:36.839 --> 00:57:38.280
Vanessa: Some kind of organized activity.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.320
Dan: Yeah.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:43.510
Vanessa: Like shooting hoops, playing hockey-
Dan: And it doesn't even have to be with people,

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:45.820
just practicing, doing some kind of routine
like that.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:50.119
Vanessa: I said something similar, which was
just to go for a walk, because that's not

00:57:50.119 --> 00:57:55.760
necessarily organized, but sometimes getting
out of the place where I'm at, getting out

00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.220
of the house, getting out of wherever I'm
feeling stressed, just changing locations,

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.790
and having the open sky-
Dan: Just getting outside.

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:06.770
Vanessa: ... breathing some cool air, or maybe
really hot air, depending on what time of

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:07.770
the year it is.

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.590
Dan: That's true, it depends on where you
live.

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:11.610
Outside might be a little too hot, or too
cold.

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:15.240
Vanessa: But it's just nice to kind of remove
yourself, and move, and take a walk.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.150
Even say, "Okay, I'm going to walk for five
minutes, and I'm going to turn around and

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.349
walk five minutes back."

00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:21.960
Sometimes 10 minutes can make a big difference.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:27.470
At least it can help me feel more relaxed,
or at least more realistic about my stress.

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.470
Dan: Definitely.

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:32.090
Vanessa: Like if something's stressing me,
maybe I shouldn't really be stressed about

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:35.609
it, so taking a walk helps me to kind of recenter
myself.

00:58:35.609 --> 00:58:36.609
Dan: Yes.

00:58:36.609 --> 00:58:39.550
Vanessa: And think, "It's not a big deal,
it's fine.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:40.550
I'll just work it out."

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.550
Dan: Okay.

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:43.010
And the next thing I would do, is take a shower.

00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:44.010
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:49.450
Dan: Well, I take night time showers, so I
don't know, I just find, for me, when I'm

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:54.339
getting clean, and not really... and like
it's kind of that same thing, I'm just like

00:58:54.339 --> 00:58:59.900
washing my arms, washing my hair, and I find
my mind kind of drifting, and it's nice and

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:00.900
warm.

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:06.079
I don't know, for me, maybe most people probably
would say taking a bath, but I don't really

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:07.090
like to take a bath.

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:11.490
Vanessa: Taking a shower, I've heard too that
when you're taking a shower, sometimes that's

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:16.950
when your best ideas happen, because you have
no stimulation, there's nothing around you,

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:23.250
you're just in the shower, so your mind can
really be blank, or you can really kind of

00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:25.030
decompress in a different way.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:26.720
I feel like that too, taking a shower feels
good.

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.220
Dan: Yeah, a nice, warm shower.

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.490
And then finally, sleeping.

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:30.490
Vanessa: Yes.

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:33.210
Dan: Going to sleep, getting good enough sleep.

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:38.560
I mean, especially nowadays where everybody
has some kind of electronics device where

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:44.230
you're staring at a screen, I think that doesn't
really help your stress levels go down.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.960
Vanessa: Don't watch this video at 2:00 AM,
if it's 2:00 AM in the morning-

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:47.960
Dan: Yeah, stop watching.

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.960
Vanessa: ... turn it off.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.960
Dan: Got to bed.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.960
Vanessa: You can watch this in the morning.

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.270
Dan: So yeah, that would be the last thing
I would do, too.

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:55.880
Lower the stress in my life and relax.

00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.320
Vanessa: Yeah, I think getting good sleep
is a really good tip, that was one of the

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320
ones that I wrote down.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.339
Is just-
Dan: So we share a few.

01:00:02.339 --> 01:00:07.910
Vanessa: ... yeah, to get better sleep because
sometimes I feel like we want to blame other

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:12.450
parts of our lives when we feel stressed,
but when you look at the basics, "Have I been

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:13.450
eating healthy?

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:14.960
Did I drink enough water today?"

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.690
And the main one, "Did I sleep enough?"

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:23.560
Probably not, at least in my case, if I feel
stressed or anxious, a lot of that's because

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:29.349
my body can't handle what's happening in daily
life, because I haven't been treating myself

01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:30.349
well.

01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:31.349
Dan: Yep.

01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:36.619
Vanessa: So if I sleep better, whether that's
consistent sleep, or a longer period of sleep,

01:00:36.619 --> 01:00:40.170
just doing that will help me to feel less
stressed during the day.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:44.770
Dan: It is situational though, some people
need more or less sleep than other people.

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:46.440
Vanessa: Yeah, so that's why I said get better
sleep.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.450
Dan: Better sleep, for you.

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:48.680
Vanessa: Whatever is better for you.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.560
But one thing I mentioned that you didn't
say, you kind of said, but is to take a tech

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.150
break.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:01.010
And a tech break, we often use this term in
our relationship to say, "Today we are not

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:04.450
going to... we're just going to put away our
phones, we're not going to do anything with

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:06.980
any electronics today at all."

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.840
And it seems like it's a simple, easy thing
to do, but it feels good just to take a little

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:18.440
break, especially if that is stressing you
out, or if you're kind of avoiding dealing

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.810
with problems by looking at your phone.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:24.869
I think a lot of use social media, or reading
articles-

01:01:24.869 --> 01:01:27.230
Dan: The phones and tablets are really bad,
I think, because they're so easy-

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:28.400
Vanessa: Yeah, to get distracted.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.820
Dan: ... to pick up and just keep using.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:34.990
There's little games, and YouTube, which you
may be on right now.

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.990
Vanessa: Yes.

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.040
I find myself-
Dan: So keep watching.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.380
Vanessa: ... when I feel stressed, sometimes
I don't don't want to think about it, so I'll

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:47.140
watch a YouTube vide, and then 30 minutes
later, I'll realize I still feel stressed.

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.530
Dan: 10 YouTube videos later.

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.530
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:51.240
Or maybe for this one it's a couple hours
later.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.770
Dan: Hey, I have a bonus tip.

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:53.770
Vanessa: Oh, bonus tip.

01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.770
All right.

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:55.770
Dan: Yeah, a bonus tip.

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:56.770
Vanessa: What's your bonus tip?

01:01:56.770 --> 01:02:01.339
Dan: I don't really meditate, but I've heard
mediation is very great for de-stressing.

01:02:01.339 --> 01:02:03.690
Vanessa: I'm curious if any of you have tried
meditation.

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:07.890
Dan: So I would also recommend meditating,
but for me, I actually tried something that

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:11.339
was kind of similar, I counted my breaths.

01:02:11.339 --> 01:02:17.079
So this was actually kind of to help me fall
asleep, but a lot of times I can't fall asleep

01:02:17.079 --> 01:02:19.579
because I'm thinking about the day and feeling
stressed.

01:02:19.579 --> 01:02:21.380
Vanessa: You can't turn your mind off.

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:26.780
Dan: So basically the idea that I heard was
to breathe in for 10 seconds.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.780
Vanessa: Okay.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.300
Dan: No, no, no, breathe in for five seconds,
then breathe out for 10 seconds.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.300
Vanessa: Oh.

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.970
Dan: So you're kind of counting one, two,
three, four, five.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:39.589
And then, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.790
And just only thinking about your breaths.

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:43.790
Vanessa: Okay.

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:48.660
Dan: You know, it really kind of puts the
focus somewhere else, and you're breathing

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:54.920
in deeply, which a lot of us do not breathe
in deeply, so it helps you to breathe in more

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.000
deeply and concentrate on your breathing.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.810
Vanessa: Yeah, I heard that one of the side
effects of using a computer a lot, or a phone

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:09.380
a lot, is that when they study people who
are looking at a screen, we blink less-

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.380
Dan: What?

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.829
Vanessa: ... so our eyes are open, they're
getting kind of red and dry, and our breathing

01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:15.829
increases.

01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:16.890
So we're kind of like-
Dan: They're just like shallow?

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:23.849
Vanessa: Yeah, like... we're just not focused,
like maybe feel a little bit of stress, or

01:03:23.849 --> 01:03:26.760
we're just not focused slow and-
Dan: On our bodies.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.760
Vanessa: ... relaxed.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760
Yeah.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.240
So those long-term effects, if you're doing
that for several hours a day, without thinking

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:39.810
about it, it can affect your body, so breathing,
yeah, slowly, can help to kind of help you

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:40.810
feel less stressed.

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:41.810
Dan: There you go.

01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:42.810
Vanessa: Wow.

01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:43.810
Dan: That's my most practical tip.

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:44.810
Vanessa: Bonus tip.

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:50.900
So I'm curious for you, what are some tips
you would give to help someone feel less stress

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.900
in their life?

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.960
To feel more relaxed?

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.300
What would you say?

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.300
All right.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.300
Let's go to the next topic.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:01.640
The next topic is sports and exercise, so
I want to know when you were a kid, what kind

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.790
of sports or activities did you participate
in?

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:06.420
Dan: Man, I played a lot of sports.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.420
Vanessa: Yeah?

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:12.860
Dan: Yeah, I think it kind of shows the privilege
we grew up in, that we had so many opportunities

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.450
to try so many different things.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.650
Vanessa: That was really lucky to be able
to do that kind of stuff.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:22.660
Dan: So first I started out with baseball,
but it was called t-ball, so you actually

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.590
put the ball on a tee, and you put the ball
there, and you just hit it off of it.

01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:27.830
Vanessa: So no one's throwing the ball.

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.460
Dan: Yeah, I was really little.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460
Vanessa: It's just stationary.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:34.710
Dan: And I actually remember when the coaches
started pitching to me, I got kind of scared

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:37.390
of the ball and I didn't want to play anymore.

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:38.390
Vanessa: It's a big deal.

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:42.440
Dan: Yeah, I was really little, so I stopped
playing that and I started playing soccer.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.440
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.880
Dan: And swimming as well.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.190
So you call it, probably football in your
country, but it's interesting, many, many

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.080
children, play soccer in America.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.870
Vanessa: Yeah, I think it's easy to get into
because you just are running and kicking a

01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:57.870
ball.

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:58.870
Dan: Sure.

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:00.260
Vanessa: There's no equipment or specialized
movements-

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.260
Dan: Right.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.260
Vanessa: ... at least for kids.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.350
Dan: But for some reason, it's not a popular
sport to watch.

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:08.381
Vanessa: Or for adults, a lot of adults don't
play soccer.

01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:10.040
Dan: Adults don't play soccer that much, it's
just children.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.040
Vanessa: Yeah.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.599
Dan: But I played soccer for probably like
six year.

01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:14.599
Vanessa: Oh.

01:05:14.599 --> 01:05:16.250
Dan: And then I never played it again.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.250
Yeah.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.320
Vanessa: Just as a kid.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.320
Dan: Yep.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.280
So I did that, and I did swimming, and gymnastics
for a while.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.369
I had a phase where I used to like to do a
lot of flips-

01:05:26.369 --> 01:05:27.369
Vanessa: Oh, cool.

01:05:27.369 --> 01:05:30.390
Dan: ... so I would jump on the trampoline
and do back flips and front flips.

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:32.070
Vanessa: In a gymnasium that's like a gymnastics
center.

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:33.880
Dan: Yeah, but also in my backyard.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.880
We had a trampoline.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.880
Vanessa: Ah, cool.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.730
Dan: So I would do that, and then I did figure
skating where we were doing spinning and stuff.

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:41.359
Vanessa: I did figure skating too.

01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:42.420
Dan: Yes.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.240
And then my brother convinced me to take up
a more manly sport, hockey.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.460
Vanessa: Oh, it's a shame, you probably would
have been really good at figure skating.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.310
Dan: Yeah, I was all right, but-
Vanessa: Yeah.

01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:55.050
I think that's the kind of thing that-
Dan: ... it wasn't my true love-

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:56.050
Vanessa: Like hockey?

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.050
Dan: ... that would be hockey.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:59.400
Vanessa: Well, I'm glad that you found your
true love, hockey.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.730
Dan: I do love hockey, but I don't really
have the build for it, I'm a little too small,

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:04.740
but I still had a lot of fun playing hockey.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:05.849
Vanessa: Yeah, and you still play hockey.

01:06:05.849 --> 01:06:06.849
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:06:06.849 --> 01:06:09.069
Vanessa: You play on a team here in our city.

01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:11.109
Dan: That's not all of my sports-
Vanessa: I feel like as a... you had a lot

01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:13.240
of organized sports as a kid-
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.859
Vanessa: ... and maybe that's just because
you have a older brother, or just something

01:06:16.859 --> 01:06:18.780
that you wanted to do, but I feel like for
me-

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.260
Dan: I think my dad thought it was good for
me too.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.260
Vanessa: Oh.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.440
Dan: Which I think is true, it's good for
kids to get into organized sports.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.440
Vanessa: Sure.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.440
Sure.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.270
I feel like for me as a kid I didn't do team
sports as much, like we just played in the

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:32.280
backyard a lot.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.470
Dan: Weren't you kind of a timid child, too?

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:39.560
Vanessa: I wouldn't say I was timid, but I
didn't like physical contact with other kids,

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.220
so basketball for me was really physically
aggressive.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.220
Dan: Too rough.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.780
Vanessa: Yeah, a little too rough, I didn't
really like that.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.680
Dan: You should try hockey.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.880
Vanessa: That's very rough.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:56.800
But I loved swimming, so I think that swimming
was probably the main sport of my childhood,

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.920
and through high school every summer my sister
and I were on a swim team, and that meant

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.130
that every day, twice a day, we would go to
swim practice, and I-

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:09.480
Dan: Vanessa's a really good swimmer, she
can kick my butt.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.240
Vanessa: Not literally, that is a figurative
expression.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.260
That means I can swim better than Dan, which
is true.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.260
Dan: It's true.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:21.170
Vanessa: But it just means that I know the
technique, and if Dan or you-

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.540
Dan: I'm out there like struggling.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:26.569
Vanessa: ... if you know the right technique,
you can have a lot of endurance because you're

01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:31.599
not wasting your energy, so I feel like I
learned the right technique, so I can swim

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:36.079
longer because I know the right technique
because I practiced it a lot.

01:07:36.079 --> 01:07:40.400
So we would always swim, and then we'd have
swim competitions, which are called swim meets,

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.470
and that was a fun part of my childhood growing,
was swimming, kind of this... it's kind of

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:46.940
a team thing, but not really.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.920
You have a team, but you're still individual.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.040
Dan: So like combined scores, is that how
it works?

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:56.990
Vanessa: Well, you would be... you're part
of the community team, like your community,

01:07:56.990 --> 01:08:02.390
your neighborhood is the team, but then each
person has an individual score.

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:03.390
Dan: Score.

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:07.683
Vanessa: So it's kid of a team, kid of individual,
and I liked that.

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.690
And it was not physically aggressive.

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:11.460
Dan: That would make me so nervous.

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.460
Vanessa: Yeah.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:16.799
Dan: These individual sports, I feel the pressure
way too much.

01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:19.670
If I were swimming and racing, I'd be so scared.

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:26.159
But when I play a sport like basketball, you're
on a team, and so you're kind of depending

01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:28.239
on each other more, it's not all up to you.

01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:29.239
Vanessa: Yeah.

01:08:29.239 --> 01:08:31.650
Dan: Although, if you make a big mistake,
then everybody's looking at you.

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:32.650
Vanessa: Yeah.

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:33.650
Dan: That's no fun.

01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:38.329
Vanessa: Yeah, I feel like I like having a
team, but at the same time, I like having

01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:42.190
kind of your own thing going on, you can kind
of be more individualistic.

01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:43.190
Dan: Yeah.

01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:48.799
Vanessa: So I'm curious for you, growing up
did you play organized sports like Dan?

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:53.719
I also did some volleyball in high school,
those types of things, kind of organized sports.

01:08:53.719 --> 01:08:57.779
But did you play organized sports like that,
or did you just play with your friends in

01:08:57.779 --> 01:09:01.309
the neighborhood, like I did growing up with
my friends in the neighborhood?

01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:05.729
What kind of activities, or exercise type
things did you do when you were a child?

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:07.599
All right, let's go to the next topic.

01:09:07.599 --> 01:09:14.179
The next topic is electronics, this is another
hypothetical, maybe a dream type question,

01:09:14.179 --> 01:09:20.939
but I want to know if you could upgrade any
electronics in your life for no price, it's

01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:24.130
free, what would you like to upgrade in your
life?

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:25.130
Dan: Interesting.

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:29.119
Yeah, I feel like I'm pretty satisfied with
our electronic status.

01:09:29.119 --> 01:09:30.329
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

01:09:30.329 --> 01:09:31.539
Dan: Electronics status.

01:09:31.539 --> 01:09:34.259
Yeah, because you know me.

01:09:34.259 --> 01:09:37.349
I already upgrade my electronics quite freely.

01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:38.589
Vanessa: Dan likes electronics.

01:09:38.589 --> 01:09:41.880
Dan: I do, especially like speakers and music.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:47.219
I love music, so I buy a lot of headphones,
and a lot speakers, and stuff like this.

01:09:47.219 --> 01:09:51.279
And every time I'm about to buy something
like that she looks at me like, "Why are you

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.239
buying another thing like this?"

01:09:53.239 --> 01:09:55.929
I haven't bought too much-
Vanessa: Yeah, it's not too much.

01:09:55.929 --> 01:10:01.920
Dan: ... but I just tend to browse, and sometimes
I look at these humongous speakers that would

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.980
fill an opera room, or something, and I'm
like, "These would be awesome to have."

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:11.079
Vanessa: And then I need to remind Dan that
we don't live in a house the size of a football

01:10:11.079 --> 01:10:12.079
field, like his dream.

01:10:12.079 --> 01:10:15.070
Dan: But in my dream house-
Vanessa: Someday when we have that dream house,

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:16.070
right?

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:17.070
Dan: ... it will have those speakers, yes.

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.369
Vanessa: What would you like to upgrade if
you could do it for no price?

01:10:19.369 --> 01:10:21.959
Dan: Yeah, so right now it would be a laptop.

01:10:21.959 --> 01:10:24.860
Vanessa: Oh, yeah, your laptop just broke.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.519
Dan: Yeah, so our son, Theo, decided to step
on my laptop.

01:10:29.519 --> 01:10:35.070
And it still actually works pretty well, but
it snapped in half, so somehow it's still

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:36.820
working, but it's old anyways.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:40.040
Vanessa: Yeah, it's his fault, but you know,
you shouldn't have left it on the floor.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.559
Dan: Yeah, so I'll probably update my laptop
soon, which is a very doable thing nowadays.

01:10:44.559 --> 01:10:45.559
Vanessa: Okay.

01:10:45.559 --> 01:10:48.789
Yeah, you could get a laptop that isn't broken
in half.

01:10:48.789 --> 01:10:53.199
Dan: Yeah, and the second thing is actually
something we've never had before, which would

01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:54.750
be a security system.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.060
Vanessa: Oh.

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:00.300
Dan: It sounds like you would only want this
in a neighborhood where you would-

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.420
Vanessa: You feel kind of dangerous.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.420
Yeah.

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.420
Dan: ... you feel like you're in danger.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.749
But I still feel like it would just kind of
add comfort to me.

01:11:06.749 --> 01:11:07.749
Vanessa: Okay.

01:11:07.749 --> 01:11:12.659
Dan: We've always lived in apartments where
they had a gate, or a front door, where-

01:11:12.659 --> 01:11:14.099
Vanessa: You have other people around you.

01:11:14.099 --> 01:11:17.689
Dan: ... and you have other people around
you, you're not like just such a solo target.

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:24.010
Because in America, you're just living in
a house in neighborhood, and it's like standalone,

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:29.260
so I'd like to get some cameras, and something
I could check on the house and make sure everything's

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.260
okay.

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.739
And just for peace of mind mostly.

01:11:31.739 --> 01:11:32.739
Vanessa: Okay.

01:11:32.739 --> 01:11:34.579
Yeah, I feel like our neighborhood's not dangerous
at all.

01:11:34.579 --> 01:11:35.579
Dan: It's very safe, yeah.

01:11:35.579 --> 01:11:41.849
Vanessa: But even if you leave to go away
for a week, and you want to be able to see

01:11:41.849 --> 01:11:43.330
outside the house, that could be helpful,
yeah.

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:48.719
Dan: Yeah, and in modern times there's a lot
of really good security systems out there.

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.050
Vanessa: Yeah, that could be helpful.

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:55.929
I feel like, for me, my answer to this is-
Dan: This shows how much Vanessa cares about

01:11:55.929 --> 01:11:56.929
electronics.

01:11:56.929 --> 01:12:01.209
Vanessa: I had to think about this for a long
time, because I don't really care about electronics

01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:02.209
that much-
Dan: I always choose the electronics, I bought

01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:03.209
her computer.

01:12:03.209 --> 01:12:04.209
I actually built her computer.

01:12:04.209 --> 01:12:10.869
Vanessa: Yeah, Dan built the computer that
we use for editing and for doing work, but

01:12:10.869 --> 01:12:17.480
I feel like for me something electronic that
I would like to upgrade is kind of practical,

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:22.579
our car that we have, you use a key to open
it, and that's fine.

01:12:22.579 --> 01:12:23.579
Dan: What?

01:12:23.579 --> 01:12:24.579
You use a key?

01:12:24.579 --> 01:12:29.449
Vanessa: But it would be really great to have
a beeper button, so this is pretty typical-

01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:32.690
Dan: This is funny because everybody in America
has this, except for us.

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:40.050
Vanessa: Yeah, I think if your car is newer
than 2000, so if it's within the last 20 years,

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:43.610
you probably have a beeper that opens the
car door.

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:48.320
Some really new cars have a beeper that turns
on the car, I don't need that, I just would

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.809
like a beeper that can open the door, because
we have a two year old and soon we will have

01:12:53.809 --> 01:12:58.510
another child, and opening the car on one
side, going to the other, putting him in the

01:12:58.510 --> 01:13:02.390
car, coming back, unlocking it, it seems so-
Dan: Yeah, we never realized how much we'd

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:03.390
appreciate this.

01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:05.210
Vanessa: Yeah, I would really appreciate this
small convenience.

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:09.849
Dan: I mean, our car should have this, but
we bought it used, and the person who sold

01:13:09.849 --> 01:13:11.709
us the car lost those keys.

01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:13.579
Vanessa: Yeah, they only had the regular key.

01:13:13.579 --> 01:13:14.579
Dan: Yeah.

01:13:14.579 --> 01:13:18.369
Vanessa: So do you think that it's possible,
because that existed before, could we do this?

01:13:18.369 --> 01:13:19.699
Dan: Yes, it's very easy.

01:13:19.699 --> 01:13:20.699
Vanessa: Oh, really?

01:13:20.699 --> 01:13:24.790
Dan: Yeah, we have to go to the dealership
and ask them, and they have to calibrate it.

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:27.550
Vanessa: And we have to just buy more keys?

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:28.760
My dream is going to come true.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760
Dan: We could make this happen.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760
Vanessa: Okay.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:35.040
Dan: But I think at the time when I asked
the dealership about that, we had just bought

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.920
the car, and it was pretty expensive, and
we didn't really have that much money, and

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.309
I was like, "We can't afford to get the keys
too."

01:13:41.309 --> 01:13:44.060
Vanessa: Sure, because we decided to pay for
the car outright.

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.060
Dan: Right.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:49.000
But it's definitely doable, this very simple
fix in your life.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.249
Vanessa: Wow, dreams come true right here
on YouTube, thank you.

01:13:52.249 --> 01:13:58.320
Well, I'm curious for you, if you could upgrade,
or if you could have some electronics completely

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.809
for free with no price added, what would you
like to upgrade in your life?

01:14:03.809 --> 01:14:04.809
I'm curious.

01:14:04.809 --> 01:14:05.809
Let us know.

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:06.809
All right.

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.099
Let's go to the last topic.

01:14:08.099 --> 01:14:11.409
Our final topic is money.

01:14:11.409 --> 01:14:16.179
I want to know, what are three purchases that
you regret?

01:14:16.179 --> 01:14:17.530
Three things that were not worth it.

01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:18.530
Dan: That I regret.

01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:19.530
Not three things I love?

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:23.909
Vanessa: No, what were three purchases that
after you bought it you said, "Ah, I shouldn't

01:14:23.909 --> 01:14:25.320
have bought this."

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.280
Dan: Oh, okay, so regretful purchases.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.550
Dan: Well, the first one I can think of kind
of checks all of the boxes as something you

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:34.550
regret.

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:37.530
Because in the first place, you didn't want
me to buy this.

01:14:37.530 --> 01:14:39.139
Vanessa: Because it was-
Dan: Expensive.

01:14:39.139 --> 01:14:40.139
Vanessa: ... headphones.

01:14:40.139 --> 01:14:41.960
We were talking about music devices.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.380
Dan: We were talking about it.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.380
Yes.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.440
I already had headphones that I listen to
all the time-

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.619
Vanessa: That he loves.

01:14:48.619 --> 01:14:54.389
Dan: ... so I was already getting the judgment
feelings from Vanessa, but I thought maybe

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:57.760
I wanted something with even better sound,
maybe a different kind of sound.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.639
I was looking for the new sound.

01:14:59.639 --> 01:15:01.900
Vanessa: But what happened?

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.699
Dan: We didn't have very much money at this
time either, so-

01:15:04.699 --> 01:15:06.040
Vanessa: Ah, that was another layer.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:13.699
Dan: ... I bought these over $100 headphones,
and we took them home, and they started hurting

01:15:13.699 --> 01:15:15.480
my ears-
Vanessa: Because they were kind of-

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.480
Dan: ... they were just painful.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.150
Vanessa: ... they were like noise canceling
headphones?

01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:22.809
Dan: No, it's like they're on ear, they just,
they weren't really build to listen to as

01:15:22.809 --> 01:15:23.829
long as I do.

01:15:23.829 --> 01:15:24.829
Vanessa: Okay.

01:15:24.829 --> 01:15:27.639
Dan: So they hurt my ears, and I was like,
"Oh, no.

01:15:27.639 --> 01:15:29.090
They're hurting my ears, this is really bad."

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:30.320
Vanessa: "I can't tell Vanessa."

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.320
Dan: "I can't."

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320
Yeah.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.119
But then also, we bought them in South Korea,
and the place that I bought them had a no

01:15:37.119 --> 01:15:39.760
return policy, so I couldn't return them.

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.219
Vanessa: And then what happened?

01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:47.939
Dan: And then I brought them home, and I sat
them down, and our cat walked up to them and

01:15:47.939 --> 01:15:50.260
bit the cord and just broke them.

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.869
Vanessa: Yes, within five minutes.

01:15:51.869 --> 01:15:53.239
Dan: Within five minutes.

01:15:53.239 --> 01:15:54.780
No, like five seconds.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.499
The second I sat the headphones down, the
cat bit them.

01:15:57.499 --> 01:16:01.070
Vanessa: And it was the kind of cord that
you can't just take out and replace it, you

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:04.469
have to do some... you have to send it into
the company and pay a lot to get it fixed.

01:16:04.469 --> 01:16:05.729
Dan: Well, I didn't know how to fix it.

01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:08.580
I think my dad actually fixed it later and
he used them.

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.580
Vanessa: Oh, that's good.

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.139
Dan: So there you go, it actually worked out
in the end.

01:16:11.139 --> 01:16:12.139
Vanessa: Wow.

01:16:12.139 --> 01:16:13.269
But yeah, there was a couple layers of regret.

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:17.360
Dan: Yeah, there was a lot of layers of regret,
and then the cat bit the cord anyway.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.459
Vanessa: Ah, and that's something that we
should have known.

01:16:21.459 --> 01:16:25.630
We should have put them up somewhere, you
could have put them somewhere else, but it

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:27.480
just kind of was icing on the cake.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.480
Dan: Yeah.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.119
Vanessa: Which means, it was one more thing.

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:31.119
Dan: Now I can't even use them.

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:33.920
Because I was like hoping, "Oh, some day maybe
they'll be more comfortable.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.199
Maybe they'll just feel better, I'll get used
to them."

01:16:36.199 --> 01:16:38.949
Vanessa: But then you can't even use them
because our cat bit the cord.

01:16:38.949 --> 01:16:39.949
Dan: Yep.

01:16:39.949 --> 01:16:41.309
Vanessa: Well, that's a regretful purchase.

01:16:41.309 --> 01:16:42.679
Dan: There you go, there's a whole story behind
that.

01:16:42.679 --> 01:16:44.250
Vanessa: Yeah, can I say one of mine first?

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:45.250
Dan: Go ahead.

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.250
Yes.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.250
Vanessa: Okay.

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:52.889
One of mine is much smaller, but it is anytime
that I buy tea at Starbucks, always a bad

01:16:52.889 --> 01:16:53.889
decision.

01:16:53.889 --> 01:16:54.889
Dan: Sorry, Starbucks.

01:16:54.889 --> 01:17:00.050
Vanessa: Yeah, but I don't like coffee, and
if I go to Starbucks that's the only drink

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:06.159
that I can drink, because they have a lot
of coffee stuff, a lot of sweet stuff, but

01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:11.439
one tea bag at Starbucks, you're just buying
a tea bag with hot water, they're not making

01:17:11.439 --> 01:17:12.439
anything-
Dan: Fancy.

01:17:12.439 --> 01:17:15.719
Vanessa: ... it's not a specialized drink.

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:22.449
It's just hot water and a tea bag, and it's
like $2.50, or something.

01:17:22.449 --> 01:17:25.590
Like $2.50 just for a bag of tea.

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:28.119
And you can buy a whole box of tea for the
same price.

01:17:28.119 --> 01:17:34.030
Dan: By the way, this is the difference between
Vanessa and I, is that I would never sweat

01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:35.030
a purchase like that.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:36.610
Vanessa: Well for me it's the taste.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:43.219
It's not necessarily the price, the price
is high for tea, but the taste is never worth

01:17:43.219 --> 01:17:44.219
it.

01:17:44.219 --> 01:17:46.709
It's just mediocre tea, it's not even that
great.

01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:48.080
Dan: I'd still never regret it.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.120
Vanessa: Yeah, well-
Dan: I don't regret cheap purchases, I never

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120
think about it.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.159
Vanessa: I feel like for me it's just annoying
because I want to have a cool drink if I'm

01:17:56.159 --> 01:18:00.300
going to a coffee shop, but then it's just
a tea bag in water.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.999
It's not even loose leaf tea.

01:18:01.999 --> 01:18:04.190
Anyway, I'm a tea snob, so let's go to yours.

01:18:04.190 --> 01:18:05.190
Dan: That's true.

01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:09.959
All right, the next in my list could be actually
a category in and of itself, but the most

01:18:09.959 --> 01:18:16.550
recent occurrence was when we went to a place
on our beach vacation called The Turtle Museum.

01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:17.550
Vanessa: Oh.

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:22.459
Dan: And it sounded all fancy, but it was
probably $15 bucks a person to get in.

01:18:22.459 --> 01:18:25.360
Vanessa: Yeah, it was like a turtle rehabilitation
center.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.670
Dan: Yeah, but there was just one room with
some pictures on the wall, and then we thought

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:34.929
we were going to see turtles up close and
personal, but they were just in big swimming

01:18:34.929 --> 01:18:36.270
pools and you could barely see them.

01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:37.699
Vanessa: Were they breathing out of their
butts?

01:18:37.699 --> 01:18:39.519
Dan: They probably were at the time.

01:18:39.519 --> 01:18:40.849
Vanessa: No, they're sea turtles.

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:43.449
Dan: You're right, they weren't breathing
out of their butts.

01:18:43.449 --> 01:18:48.340
And so I was just disappointed with the whole
experience and didn't think it was worth it.

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.780
Although, that was a little different because
I felt like I was donating because they rescue

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:58.190
turtles, but there are a lot of places that
are like this, like a museum, or some kind

01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:04.420
of show that maybe you pay a up front cost,
and then the show or the museum is just not

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.420
very good, or boring.

01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:08.380
Vanessa: Yeah, like have you ever traveled
somewhere and you paid to enter a museum,

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.219
or you paid to enter some building and it
just wasn't worth it.

01:19:12.219 --> 01:19:16.590
I feel like that's happened a lot, and that's
just the most recent for us, is that, "Okay,

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:21.820
I feel okay because I donated some money to
that turtle rehabilitation center."

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:27.189
But we didn't really get to see turtles in
the way that we wanted to.

01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:28.820
Dan: I wanted to touch a turtle.

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.749
Vanessa: Oh, but they are in a hospital, they're
being rehabilitated.

01:19:31.749 --> 01:19:33.130
Dan: That's true, it was a turtle hospital.

01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:34.130
Vanessa: Yeah.

01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:35.280
Do you have any other-
Dan: But it sounded way cooler-

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.280
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.280
Yeah, it did sound cool.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.369
"Go to the turtle center and see the turtles."

01:19:39.369 --> 01:19:41.530
Dan: Yeah, my last thing is just a small thing.

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:48.119
I bought some t-shirts online, and it's kind
of iffy to buy clothes online, but I always

01:19:48.119 --> 01:19:52.739
felt like I like the picture that was on them,
but then the quality of the shirt wasn't very

01:19:52.739 --> 01:19:54.120
good or-
Vanessa: Especially when it's online, you

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.120
can't feel it.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120
Dan: ... it didn't fit that well.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.730
Yeah, not a great idea.

01:19:57.730 --> 01:19:59.239
I've regretted some of those purchases.

01:19:59.239 --> 01:20:03.719
Vanessa: Another thing that I feel like I've
bought that wasn't worth it, this is a general

01:20:03.719 --> 01:20:09.570
category, but it's some toys for our, now
he's two year old, but throughout his short

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:13.969
life, some toys that I bought for him that
I thought he'd like, because he played with

01:20:13.969 --> 01:20:18.949
at a friend's house, or I just thought it
would be cool, but he didn't really like it.

01:20:18.949 --> 01:20:24.959
For example, there's this thing that was...
it's like a bead maze, and I remember liking

01:20:24.959 --> 01:20:27.980
this as a kid, which is why I got it-
Dan: I thought he played with that.

01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:32.849
Vanessa: Not really, he kind of wanted to
just pull the beads off, but he couldn't play

01:20:32.849 --> 01:20:33.849
with.

01:20:33.849 --> 01:20:37.489
But I remember I played with it as a kid,
and I found it at a second hand store.

01:20:37.489 --> 01:20:42.030
It was like $10, it wasn't that much, but
I thought he'd play with it.

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:43.070
I was like, "This is it.

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.249
He's going to play with this for so long,
it's going to be great."

01:20:45.249 --> 01:20:47.010
And he just never really played with it.

01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:50.110
So I feel like-
Dan: This will probably be an ongoing problem.

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:51.110
Vanessa: Yeah.

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:52.169
So now I-
Dan: Now that we have kids.

01:20:52.169 --> 01:20:57.510
Vanessa: I've tried to kind of back up and
think, "Okay, he likes to play with these

01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:58.679
three things.

01:20:58.679 --> 01:21:03.610
If other people want to give him presents,
and give him other toys, that's fine, but

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:11.570
I'm not really going to invest in more toys
because he kind of likes the same things all

01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:12.570
the time."

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:13.570
Dan: Legos, legos, legos.

01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:14.960
Vanessa: Legos, legos, legos.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.550
Sometimes Play-Doh, sometimes the sandbox.

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:18.829
Dan: But mostly legos.

01:21:18.829 --> 01:21:22.420
Vanessa: But generally the same couple toys
again, and again, and again.

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:27.520
So I'm curious for you, what are some purchases
that you've made that weren't worth it, that

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.520
you regretted?

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.369
This video is free on YouTube, so this is
not a purchase.

01:21:32.369 --> 01:21:34.749
I hope that you have not regretted spending
your time, though, with us.

01:21:34.749 --> 01:21:38.769
Dan: Yeah, I know what you wouldn't regret,
purchasing the Fearless Fluency Club.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:39.769
Vanessa: Oh.

01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:41.460
Well-
Dan: There's a pitch for you.

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:47.269
Vanessa: This is our monthly English course
where we teach about a different topic every

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.789
month, and you learn the vocabulary, phrasal
verbs, pronunciation.

01:21:49.789 --> 01:21:55.030
We have a private Facebook group where a lot
of members meet together and talk together

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:57.090
to practice speaking English.

01:21:57.090 --> 01:22:00.280
And once a month I have a group Google hangout
and we talk together.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:05.309
Just a great way to expand your English and
be able to learn more.

01:22:05.309 --> 01:22:08.419
So if you enjoyed our conversation today-
Dan: Yeah, and one might say, "Become fluent."

01:22:08.419 --> 01:22:10.530
Vanessa: Yes, I hope so, become more confident.

01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:12.519
Well, thank you so much for joining me today.

01:22:12.519 --> 01:22:13.519
Dan: You're welcome.

01:22:13.519 --> 01:22:14.519
We're done?

01:22:14.519 --> 01:22:15.519
Vanessa: Wow, this was a lot.

01:22:15.519 --> 01:22:16.519
Dan: Can you believe it?

01:22:16.519 --> 01:22:17.519
Did you make it all the way though?

01:22:17.519 --> 01:22:19.449
Vanessa: If you made it this far, congratulations.

01:22:19.449 --> 01:22:21.310
Pat yourself on the back.

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:26.699
We asked a lot of questions today, so I'm
going to put those in the description below,

01:22:26.699 --> 01:22:30.860
so that you can go to each topic if you want
to go back and watch a certain topic, or if

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:36.780
you saw some vocabulary appear that you'd
like to review and practice, you can always

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.929
go back and review what we talked about.

01:22:38.929 --> 01:22:41.789
If you have any questions, feel free to ask,
and make sure that you write a comment and

01:22:41.789 --> 01:22:44.050
answer some of these questions yourself, use
English.

01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:45.050
Dan: Yes.

01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:46.499
Vanessa: Thank you so much for joining me,
Dan.

01:22:46.499 --> 01:22:47.499
Dan: You're welcome.

01:22:47.499 --> 01:22:48.499
It was very enjoyable.

01:22:48.499 --> 01:22:49.510
Vanessa: Yes, I appreciate your time.

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:50.719
Dan: It was a journey.

01:22:50.719 --> 01:22:51.719
Vanessa: Your energy.

01:22:51.719 --> 01:22:52.739
Oh, it was a journey.

01:22:52.739 --> 01:22:54.939
Yes, we went through a lot of different topics
today.

01:22:54.939 --> 01:22:59.519
