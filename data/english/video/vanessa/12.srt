00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.250
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com,
and I'm here with my husband, Dan-

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.250
Dan: Hello.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.690
Vanessa: ... and we're going to talk about
birthdays today because ...

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.650
Dan: It's Vanessa's birthday.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.050
Vanessa: Yay.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.180
Let's get started.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.039
Today my husband Dan and I are here on our
wonderful back deck in nature with the birds

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.189
and the bugs-
Dan: And the cicadas, apparently.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.500
Vanessa: The cicadas are really loud.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.509
Dan: Maybe you won't hear it.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.509
We'll see.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.000
Vanessa: ... to have this natural conversation
about birthdays.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.489
I hope you'll be able to immerse yourself
in what we're saying.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.000

so that you can catch every word we're saying.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.329
So, are you ready to get started with my first
question?

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.329
Dan: Yes.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.329
Vanessa: All right.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.329
I have four questions today.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.329
Dan: Oh boy.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.980
Vanessa: One is what are typical birthday
traditions in the US?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.760
Which might be similar to your country, they
might not.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.199
And the second one is, what are children's
birthday celebrations like?

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.379
Like our childhoods.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.719
What are adult birthday celebrations like?

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.830
And finally, what are the most important birthdays
in the US?

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.890
So, which years are the most important?

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.520
And you'll have to wait until the end of our
lesson to find out.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.869
So let's start with that first one.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.140
What are some typical birthday celebrations
in the US?

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.619
Dan: Some typical traditions?

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.619
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.390
Dan: Well, I'd say there are lots of little
different traditions you may do.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.130
Sometimes there're little games like, pin
the tail on the donkey.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.920
I'm not sure if you've heard of this.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.409
But the only tradition that almost always
holds true is eating a dessert, usually a

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.880
cake, and singing happy birthday and getting
either a card or a present.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.700
Vanessa: Yes, children are more likely to
get presents, but adults might get presents

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.729
too, at least a card from people you love.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.840
Dan: Right, and this differentiates a lot
depending on if it's an adult or a child.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.500
A child is more likely to get a lot more presents
in America.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.110
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.240
Dan: And you're a lot less likely to have
a big party as an adult as well.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.950
Well, we'll get to adult celebrations soon,
but I want to set the stage for what happens

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.020
when, for instance, you're at a child's birthday
party, they're turning seven years old, and

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.050
you've just eaten probably pizza.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.050
Typical birthday thing.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.110
You've just eaten pizza and they say it's
time-

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.110
Dan: Yeah.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.110
You don't feel very good the day after.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.440
Vanessa: Yeah, and they say "It's time for
cake."

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440
What happens?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.110
You turn off the lights ...
Dan: And you sing happy birthday.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.420
Vanessa: But why do you turn off the lights?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.420
Dan: Oh, so you could put candles in the cake.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.270
Vanessa: Yeah, so usually the parents will
be in the other room, secretly putting candles

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.700
on the cake, and they'll light them, so there's
fire, and then they'll turn the lights off

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.600
and all of the kids or all the people in the
room will sing.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.420
Dan: Happy birthday to you.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.330
Happy birthday to you.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.530
Happy birthday, dear Vanessa.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.590
Happy to you.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.130
Vanessa: Happy birthday to you.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.130
Happy birthday to you.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.130
Happy birthday, to me.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.130
Happy to you.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.930
Yeah, so they'll sing this song while the
cake is coming out, and then the cake will

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.330
be in front of the birthday person, and that
birthday person will close their eyes.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.720
And why are they closing their eyes?

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.570
Dan: Yeah, so we do this to make a wish, although
I actually forgot about this because I haven't

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.800
really done that very much.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.960
Vanessa: I think as a kid it meant more.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.840
Dan: I mean, we did it as a joke, but as a
kid, you're always thinking, "I got to make

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.800
a wish and then blow out my candles."

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.312
Vanessa: It's got to be a good one.

00:03:29.312 --> 00:03:30.312
Dan: Yup.

00:03:30.312 --> 00:03:31.840
Vanessa: And we usually say if you tell people
what the wish is, it will never come true.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840
Dan: Mm, yes.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.140
Vanessa: So it has to be a secret wish usually.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.070
Maybe not every place in the US is the same,
but you close your eyes, make a wish.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.070
For example like, "I hope that I will get
the best present for my birthday."

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.080
I don't know what kids wish for.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080
Dan: A new bike.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080
Vanessa: Yes, a new bike.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.730
So, things that kids wish for, and then you
blow out the candles, and that's it.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.330
Well, after you eat the cake, after you have
pizza and a cake, usually it's present time

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.890
and open presents wrapped in wrapping paper.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.720
And that's about it.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.540
That seems to be kind of the main tradition.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.200
Dan: Yeah, that's a standard tradition.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.300
Dan: And then there's a lot of little variances
here and there.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.300
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.349
I would like to add one tradition though to
all birthdays around the world.

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:26.919
Well, we have two children, and when our oldest
child had his first birthday, which you'll

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:34.229
find out soon is a very important birthday,
I felt really emotional on his first birthday

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:41.680
because I remembered all of the intense work
that I needed to do during his birth.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.520
So I gave birth to our son.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520
Dan: Me too.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520
Vanessa: Yes, it was really hard.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.129
Dan: I did help a lot, but it was nothing
compared to giving birth.

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.129
Vanessa: Yes.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:58.770
So, I felt like this hard work and this emotional
time that I had experienced when he was born,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.280
we don't really include that in birthdays.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.120
And I propose starting now that on birthdays,
we include the mother in some kind of birthday

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120
tradition, maybe you country does this.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120
Dan: Yeah.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120
Some kind of celebration for the mother.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120
Yeah.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.830
Vanessa: Just even if it's a tradition of
you blow out the candles and then say, "Thanks,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.680
mom, for giving birth to me."

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.840
I feel like you both play an important part
in that day.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.810
So as somebody who has given birth two times,
I would like to have that day be a special

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.370
memory for me too, and to share with my child
that this is what happened.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.580
So, "Thank you mom, for giving birth to me.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.740
Thank you for your hard work."

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.740
All right.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.060
Let's go to the second category.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.979
Second question, which is what are childhood
birthdays like?

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.030
The next category we're going to talk about
are memorable birthdays.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.419
And usually these are in your childhood, because
birthdays as kids are bigger to do's.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.419
But who knows?

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.389
They might be also when you're a little bit
older.

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.169
So I'm curious when you were a kid, what was
a typical birthday party like?

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.879
Or do you have any memorable birthdays?

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.030
Dan: Yeah, so my typical birthday party was
not very big.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.310
My mom didn't typically go all out for most
of my birthdays.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.470
Although maybe once or twice, she really went
kind of crazy.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.470
Vanessa: Yes.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.470
Like what?

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.479
Dan: One time she themed an entire party around
space and the planets.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.819
So all of my friends who came, I don't know
if it was exactly the same amount of people

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:39.659
for planets, so we all put like stickers on
our head, that was like, "I'm Saturn, I'm

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:44.169
Jupiter," and then we got to argue about what
planets we were.

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.900
And I had-
Vanessa: The arguing was part of the party.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.900
Dan: Of course.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.900
Vanessa: That was fun.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.650
Dan: And there was a little solar system hanging
from the light.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.780
So this is kind of an example of a themed
party, which happens much, much more when

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.780
you're a child.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.780
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.449
So when I was a kid, my mom almost always
went all out and I don't think it was because

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.059
I asked her to, I think it was more just,
that's what she really enjoyed doing.

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:14.970
She enjoyed having a big celebration for my
birthday.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:20.860
I remember one time, I actually have video
footage of this, I don't know if I can figure

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.090
out how to edit it in here so you can see.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.090
Dan: You should.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:31.990
Vanessa: But she had all of the girls from
my, maybe, first grade class, come over and

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.100
she did our hair like this with braids, at
each girl's hair.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.710
She did makeup on each girl.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:43.340
I think we might've even painted our fingernails,
and we made bows for our hair, we had crafted

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.340
bows...

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.530
Vanessa's Sister: Happy birthday.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:53.289
Vanessa’s sister: And I'm going to eat all
the cake.

00:07:53.289 --> 00:08:02.639
Vanessa's Dad: You are going to eat the whole
cake, Charisse?

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.639
Vanessa’s sister: And I’m going to put
on make up.

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.639
Vanessa's Dad: Can anyone else have a piece?

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.939
Vanessa's Mom: There you go, you look great.

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:07.939
Okay.

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:09.520
All: Happy birthday to you.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.240
Happy birthday to you.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.960
Happy birthday dear Vanessa.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.680
Happy birthday to you.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.000
Vanessa's Mom: I love you.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.190
Blow your candles.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.650
There's more.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.100
Vanessa: There.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.020
Vanessa's Mom: Good job.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.460
Try that last one.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.800
Vanessa's Dad: One more.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.140
Vanessa's Mom: Good job.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.730
Oh, I love you sweet heart.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:44.480
Vanessa: I remember another party, she rented
a horse, it was like a little pony.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.590
And it came to our house in a trailer and
the owner walked it around our yard and each

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.060
kid got to sit on the back of the horse-
Dan: That's pretty awesome.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.520
Vanessa: ... and have a pony ride.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:01.870
And was our first year living in South Carolina
where we moved to, and it was my first week

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.390
of school, because September 4th, my birthday
is usually the first week of school.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.580
So I had just met all these kids in my class
and now they were at my house and having a

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.580
fun party.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.630
So good job mom, organizing that.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.630
I want to ask.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.510
Do you think it was usually your mom who wanted
to have parties like this?

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.510
Dan: Yeah.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.510
Definitely.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.510
Vanessa: We are saying moms, but.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:28.120
Dan: Well, because my dad worked a lot, especially
when I was a kid, it's basically up to my

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.660
mom to organize anything around the house,
so it's a very traditional setup.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.330
She was assumed to be the birthday lady.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.720
Vanessa: Now we're talking about birthday
parties, but what about births?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.730
Dan: Births?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:47.190
Vanessa: Do you have any interesting experiences
either, when you were born-

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.300
Dan: Yes, when Theo was born.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.450
Vanessa: When Theo was born.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.450
Our child, yes definitely.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.730
Dan: Our children were memorable.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.970
Vanessa: Or when your siblings were born?

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.970
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:55.970
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.970
Tell me about that.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.060
Dan: Well, I don't remember when I was born.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.220
But I was born on April 1st, so I always hear
the story about...

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.720
Oh, and by the way, April 1st is called April
fool's day, where people play pranks on each

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.340
other in America.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:15.410
So when my mom called her parents and said,
"I just had my baby," they didn't believe

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.410
her.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.410
Vanessa: "No, you didn't April fool's day.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.820
You didn't have your baby."

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.820
"No really."

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.420
Dan: And so that was always kind of an ongoing
issue with my birthdays as a child, because

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.440
people would play a prank on me.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.110
And I would forget because I'm like, "This
is my birthday.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.450
It's not April fool's day."

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.450
Vanessa: But it is.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.930
Dan: So I got pranked a lot.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.910
Also when my sister was born, I'm not sure
I remember the day exactly.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.610
Vanessa: You were three years old, probably.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.610
Dan: Yeah.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.610
Vanessa: Okay.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.310
Dan: I was a little over three years old,
but this is how much I cared about my sister

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.310
being born.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.510
I care a lot now, but apparently when I was
three years old, I was interested in other

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.510
things.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:11:01.570
So my mom called my grandparents, who I was
staying with and said, "Congratulations, Daniel,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.720
you have a sister."

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.120
And I said, "Well, grandma made me a hot dog."

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.750
Vanessa: You're telling me one important thing.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.270
I'm telling you another important.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.840
Dan: So this is my reply to my sister being
born, that, "I have a hot dog.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.840
You have a baby.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.090
These things are the same."

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.090
Vanessa: Cool.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.090
Yeah.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.610
It's a very, a three year old Daniel mind.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.930
So for me, when I was a kid, we had these
big parties, but then as I got a little bit

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:38.180
older, like middle school, high school, they
became more centered around my close friends,

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.940
two or three friends.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:46.930
And I have a very special couple memories,
mainly as a high schooler, maybe it was also

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:53.380
in middle school, where my family would go
on a specific hike each year.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.960
And this hike, we go on to that same hike
as a family now, but this hike is special

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.060
because-
Dan: It's beautiful.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:06.140
Vanessa: ... around September 4th, there are
lots of blueberries in season.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.330
And that means that the top of the mountain
is covered in wild blueberry bushes.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:16.160
And then around this time, in the end of summer,
beginning of fall, the blueberries are ripe.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.490
So we would go to the top of the mountain
and pick blueberries with our best friend's

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.930
family.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.770
And on the top of the mountain, they would
sing happy birthday to me.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.890
Dan: That's a good birthday.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.430
Vanessa: Yeah, it was so...

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.290
I have such nostalgic feelings when I think
about that, because to me, that's what I like

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.610
now as an adult, which we'll talk about in
just a moment.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.890
But that's what I like now with a birthday.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:42.680
It's with the close people I care about, it's
doing something simple, some kind of memory,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.240
something like this that is... something you're
probably really going to remember.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:53.220
So let's take that to transition to our next
topic, which is, Adult Birthdays, or now that

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.590
you're an adult, what do you do?

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.060
So let's talk about that.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.720
Now I want to ask about birthdays now that
we are adults.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.720
We're not children who have parents creating
birthday parties for us.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.520
So what are birthdays like for you now, when
you are an adult?

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.520
As an adult.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.250
Dan: So as an adult, it can run a wide spectrum.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.050
So I don't think people have parties as much.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.100
It just depends on the individual.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.330
For me personally, we don't really throw a
party for me.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.050
Maybe I'll get together with my parents, maybe
I'll get together with some friends, but we

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.910
don't really invite a lot of friends over
to have a big party.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.410
Vanessa: And that's just a personal choice.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:37.860
It's not wrong, if you are living in the US
and you're wondering, should I invite friends

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.371
over to my house for my birthday?

00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:40.740
Is that just for children?

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.740
No, it's fine.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.850
If you want to have a celebration, that's
totally fine, as an adult.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.660
It's just our personal preference to keep
things small, simple.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:56.180
And I think in general, for us, we opt to
give gifts that are experiences.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.180
Dan: Yeah.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.180
Do something.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.180
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.390
Well maybe go to a nice restaurant together
or we'll go to a new location that we haven't

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.840
visited before.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.990
Or like you said, we'll go to your parents'
house and they'll make us some dinner or something

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.990
special.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.990
Food.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.990
Dan: Yes.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.990
That's probably the most common thing for
us now.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.070
And it's still very common to get a gift or
at least a card.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:23.250
However, if you have a partner, then a lot
of times you're going to give something extra.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.980
That's going to be your special gift.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.670
For example, when I was in college, Vanessa
sent me a really awesome gift.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:36.070
She actually shot me a video of people at
our college that we used to both go to, but

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.300
we were actually separated at this time, I
don't know why.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.900
Vanessa: I was a little bit sad, so I made
you a video.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:48.130
Dan: She made me a personal video about all
our friends saying happy birthday to me.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.300
And she put it together and sent it to me
in the mail, and I got it at my college and

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.300
I watched it.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.700
And we were broken up, so I probably cried.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.700
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:01.120
Well, I think this was a pretty difficult
present actually, because it was a time when

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.500
it was kind of tough to find anything to record
a video with.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.670
So I had to borrow my friend's cheap camera
to record it.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.670
Dan: This was back in the day.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.400
Vanessa: My laptop was really old.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:20.170
I remember I had to send it to the computer
services, tech support at our college, four

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.210
times just to edit one video.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.540
And I filmed our friends saying, "Happy birthday,
Dan.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.100
You're a great guy," and then I would film
another friend saying the same thing.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.360
And it was something to hopefully help you
feel loved.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.360
And it worked, we got married.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.770
Dan: It was a very good Vanessa...

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.840
Yes, that worked.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.300
It's was a great Vanessa style video.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.410
Vanessa: Something personal that takes some
effort, but it's thoughtful.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:49.340
And I don't do that for every birthday, but
it's something that's really from the heart.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.960
So now that today is my birthday, at least
when you're watching it is my birthday.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.130
What are we going to do for my birthday Dan?

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.800
Dan: Well, there are still some surprises.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:06.330
However, I'm going to be making a dessert
with my toddler Theo, so it should be interesting.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.460
And we're going to make it into some shapes.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.810
I don't know, it's still a surprise, so I
don't want to give everything away, but we'll

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.140
be making a dessert with my toddler.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.140
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.860
And we'll probably have a candle or two or
maybe 33 candles, I don't know how many we

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.010
have in the kitchen and then I'll blow them
out.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.990
And that's a typical birthday celebration.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.990
Dan: That's her birthday.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.990
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:33.410
I think especially this year, we're not doing
that much for my birthday, because it was

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.730
our 10 year wedding anniversary, a couple
of weeks ago.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.670
And so we celebrated that anniversary and
my birthday is just kind of extra.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.960
Dan: Yeah.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.290
Vanessa: So I'd like to ask you my final question.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.770
What do you think are the most important birthdays
in the US?

00:16:50.770 --> 00:17:00.610
So this is a cultural thing, but if you were
to say, "It's my 20th birthday next week,"

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.610
would that be a big birthday.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.730
Dan: It wouldn't be 20th, but it would be
21st birthday.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.730
Vanessa: Yes.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.730
So let's start at the beginning of life and
then we'll get to 21st.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.730
So what do you think?

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.730
Dan: Yeah.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:16.360
So I don't think there's any universally accepted
important birthday.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.339
Although it seems like a lot of mothers celebrate
first birthday, as being very important.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.959
At least the mothers we hang around.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:28.659
Vanessa: I would say that it's becoming more
common that the first birthday of a child

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:29.659
is a big event.

00:17:29.659 --> 00:17:34.029
You invite all your family, all your friends,
the kid doesn't care, they're just one year

00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:35.669
old, they don't even know what a birthday
is.

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:36.700
Dan: They'll be happy to eat cake.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.700
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.630
But it's kind of a celebration of, "We survived
one year."

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.740
So first birthday is generally a big event.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.549
And I would say the next one would be your
16th birthday, especially girls.

00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:50.769
Dan: Yeah.

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.639
Although I think this may be dying out a bit.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:54.639
Vanessa: I don't know.

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:57.289
Dan: We still say, we have songs about sweet
16.

00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:00.260
Vanessa: We don't know many 16 year olds right
now.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.260
Dan: That's true.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.299
Vanessa: So I don't know if it's still common,
but when we were kids, that was a big birthday.

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:11.600
Dan: I don't remember throwing an extra big
party for myself or my sister at 16, but people

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:18.040
do still really set aside the 21st birthday
as a big birthday.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.779
And that is mostly because in America you
were allowed to drink alcohol at 21.

00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:28.710
So I think this is the entire reason why people
say, "21, Oh man, you've made it.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.610
Now you can go out and drink in public."

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.720
Vanessa: Does that mean that people do not
drink before they're 21?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.150
Dan: No people still drink before 21, but.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.759
Vanessa: But this is kind of a moment where
you feel like, "I'm an adult.

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:47.649
I'm allowed to drink," like you said, in public
at this point, or it is legally acceptable

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:49.320
for me to drink.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.590
So I think your first birthday, 16th especially
for girls, the 21st, definitely.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:54.590
Dan: Maybe 18th.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.590
Vanessa: 18th?

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.919
Dan: 18th is legal adulthood.

00:18:56.919 --> 00:19:02.480
Vanessa: He does legal adulthood, but I don't
feel like there's a celebration specifically

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.549
for that.

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:07.600
Usually you celebrate graduating high school
around that time, and that might be a bigger

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.590
celebration than your birthday in my opinion.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:16.150
But I think the US is so diverse with so many
different cultures and traditions and backgrounds,

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.460
that everyone is going to celebrate this in
a somewhat different way.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.460
But from our experience first 16th, the 21st.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.080
And then I would say there's a big jump to
40th birthday.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:36.740
So between 21 and 40, not so important, but
what is the term for your 40th birthday?

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.740
Dan: Yes.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.920
You are over the Hill.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.200
Vanessa: So let's explain what this means.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200
Over the Hill means...

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.450
Dan: 40, everything's downhill after that.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.450
Vanessa: Yes.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.440
Your average lifespan is 80 years old.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.940
So when you're 40, you're kind of going up,
up, up the Hill and then you're 40 and now

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.620
it all goes down.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.769
So this is kind of morbid.

00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:58.370
Dan: It's kind of dark humor.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.480
Vanessa: It's dark humor.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.009
So if you go to the grocery store, typical
grocery stores in the US, have a section with

00:20:04.009 --> 00:20:12.889
flowers and balloons and party supplies, all
of the 40th birthday supplies, are black and

00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:13.889
gray.

00:20:13.889 --> 00:20:17.879
Sometimes they have a gravestone on them like,
"Oh, you're going to the grave," so it's very

00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:18.879
dark.

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:20.670
Dan: They might even have a section that says,
"Over the Hill."

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.690
Vanessa: Over the hill.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.429
This is a very specific moment.

00:20:24.429 --> 00:20:30.259
And it's just a joke because usually when
you're 40, you're still feeling pretty young,

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:31.259
but it's just a joke.

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:34.450
So 40 is the next big birthday.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.100
And after that, I was trying to think if there's
actually a specifically big birthday, and

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.100
what do you think?

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.649
Dan: I think every decade, you just get more
sarcastic jokes about your age.

00:20:44.649 --> 00:20:47.789
Vanessa: So when you're 70 and 80 and 90.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.490
Dan: You just get cards that have more jokes
about your age.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:57.221
That's my experience with it, not that I'm
that old, but with my grandparents, what we

00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:58.221
would get them.

00:20:58.221 --> 00:20:59.221
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:03.370
I think that when you're a hundred, there's
probably a special Centennial party.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:10.470
But I know for example, for your great grandmother,
when she turned 90, all of the family, there

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:15.429
were dozens of people, got together and had
a big birthday party for her.

00:21:15.429 --> 00:21:17.950
Because if you live to be 100 years old, that's
pretty unusual.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:18.950
Dan: Very unusual.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.799
Vanessa: So when she turned 90, that was like,
"Oh, that's great.

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:23.090
Let's all get together and celebrate."

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.290
Dan: But she almost made it.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.120
I think she was 96 or something.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.190
She had a really awesome long life.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:35.600
So in this way, after your 40th birthday,
there's not really a big cultural celebration,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.049
but it's just up to your family, what they
want to celebrate.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:43.700
Well, thanks so much for celebrating my birthday
today with me, and thanks for joining me,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.700
Dan.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.700
Dan: You're welcome.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.470
Vanessa: I hope that you enjoyed this conversation.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.919
I hope that you learned some vocabulary.

00:21:48.919 --> 00:21:51.770

English.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.940
