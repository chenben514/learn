00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.140
Vanessa: Hello, hello.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.140
Dan: Hi.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.110
Vanessa: Welcome to today's live English lesson
here on the Speak English with Vanessa YouTube

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.110
channel.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.470
Today, as you can tell, I have a special guest.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.470
Dan: Who?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.340
Vanessa: It's my husband, Dan.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.900
He's going to be giving us some different
perspective and hopefully help you to hear

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.800
some new example sentences, and to just have
a real English conversation.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.470
So if you're new here, I'm Vanessa, and I
teach English here on my YouTube channel.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.150
Usually, I have a lot, a new lesson every
Friday.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.390
So if you want to get new lessons every Friday,
you can subscribe and get a notification so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.510
that you can continue to learn English with
me.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.320
But, today's lesson is super special for three
reasons.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.410
The first reason is that I have a special
guest, Dan.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.380
Dan: Hello, again.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.890
Vanessa: My second reason is that you are
going to be mastering an advanced complex

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.420
sentence structure that native speakers use
a lot.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:24.020
We're going to be asking you a question, specifically
the question of if someone gave you $500 and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.979
you had to use it for a tattoo, what would
you get?

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:29.979
Dan: Ooh.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.090
Vanessa: If someone gave you $500, what tattoo
would you get?

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.729
We're going to be talking about tattoos because
there is a super special reason, and I'm going

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.069
to share my screen with you so that you can
see why we're going to be talking about tattoos.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.909
Because I don't have a tattoo, Dan doesn't
have a tattoo, but-

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.289
Dan: No tats.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.499
Vanessa: ... I'm going to show you here on
my screen why we're talking about tattoos.

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:59.899
All right.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:07.499
You can see here that inside my course, the
Fearless Fluency Club, we're going to be talking

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.429
about tattoos.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.630
Now, we're going to be talking with my friend,
Lana, who has a lot of tattoos.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.120
She talks about the stories of her tattoos,
her colored hair, a lot of different things.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.350
And this is our topic for October, 2018.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.570
So, you're going to be learning vocabulary,
grammar, pronunciation, and also enjoying

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.720
this interesting conversation with Lana.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.390
So if you would like to continue to learn
more about tattoos, and this kind of controversial

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.430
topic ... I know in some countries it's not
something that is common or is something that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.550
is maybe looked upon in a good way.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.550
Dan: Acceptable.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.550
Vanessa: Acceptable.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.570
That's a great word.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.570
Yes.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.440
So, we're going to be talking about that in
October.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.650
If you'd like to join Dan and I in the Fearless
Fluency Club, there is a link below this video.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.910
That's the second reason why today's lesson
is special.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.790
But, we have a third reason.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.440
And the third reason is kind of crazy.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.040
Well, as I mentioned, I don't have any tattoos.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.650
Dan doesn't have any tattoos.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.970
So, what are we going to do today?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.900
Dan: I'm going to give Vanessa a tattoo.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.000
Vanessa: All right.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.200
Dan: But, it's not a real tattoo.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Don't worry.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.750
I'm going to use henna.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.500
Do you know what henna is?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.920
Vanessa: Well, I know what henna is, and I
love henna.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.830
Henna is kind of a traditional Indian type
of temporary tattoo.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.110
Dan: Yes, it's temporary, so it won't stay
on her for very long.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.210
Vanessa: Yes.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.210
Yes.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.080
While I'm giving you this lesson, Dan is going
to be drawing a secret tattoo on my arm.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.160
I don't know what it is.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.940
Dan: Yeah, I don't know what it is either.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.420
This is going to be very spur of the moment.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.950
It's a little surprise.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.650
Vanessa: Spur of the moment is a great idiom.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.650
Dan: Yes.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.650
Vanessa: Oh.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.650
What's spur of the moment mean?

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.070
Dan: It means that it's not planned.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.330
Vanessa: Spontaneous.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.580
Dan: Yes.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.919
I'm also not an artist, so maybe you should
have low expectations.

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.919
Maybe you should even expect a joke.

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:25.919
I don't know.

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.919
We'll see.

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:27.919
Vanessa: We'll see what happens.

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:28.919
Dan: I'm just going to get started.

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.080
Vanessa: So while I'm giving you and talking
about this lesson today, Dan is going to be

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080
trying his best.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080
Dan: But you got to be still.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080
Vanessa: Okay.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.080
Are you going to ... Are you starting?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.080
Dan: I'm starting.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080
Vanessa: Okay.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.129
It's hard for me because you know how I love
to use gestures and how I love to move my

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.289
arms a lot.

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.289
Dan: Yes, you do.

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.860
Vanessa: But, I can't move my arms while I'm
giving this lesson.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.300
So, I'm sorry if it's a little bit different
than normal.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.069
But at the end of this lesson, you'll get
to see what Dan's interesting tattoo idea

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.069
is.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.069
All right.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.159
So, let's get started with the topic of today,
which the generation topic is tattoos, but

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:18.020
I want to use this complex, advanced sentence
structure, which is if hypothetical questions.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.660
These are used commonly in daily conversation,
often even in business situations when you're

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.300
thinking about what might happen.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.889
It's not certain.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.610
It's just an idea.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.529
That's what hypothetical means, is that it's
something that isn't known.

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:35.789
It's just an idea.

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.470
It's not really concrete and happening now,
just an idea.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.729
So, that's what the questions is today.

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.439
I'm also going to be asking Dan, so he might
have to take a little break from his tattoo-

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.479
Dan: Artistic endeavor.

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.969
Vanessa: ... artistic endeavor to answer the
question.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:06:00.370
But, my question today is, if someone gave
you $500 ... I've never had a tattoo, so I

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.360
don't really know how expensive they are,
but I imagine with $500 you could get a pretty

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360
tattoo.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.340
So, I want to know, if someone gave you $500,
what would you get?

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.370
Let's here what Dan has to say first, and
then I'm going to explain some of the grammar

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.990
so that you can make your own sentence with
this as well.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.779
I'm not going to look at your tattoo.

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.069
What would you say to this question?

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:31.319
If your brother said, "Dan, you have to get
a tattoo with this $500.

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.529
You have no choice you have to- "
Dan: I'd say, "Just give me the money, please."

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.090
Vanessa: But he said you have no choice.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.090
You have to.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.090
Dan: I have no choice.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.090
Vanessa: This is a hypothetical question.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.919
Obviously, your brother wouldn't force you
to get a tattoo.

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:41.919
Dan: Yeah.

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.770
Vanessa: But, let's just say that in this
hypothetical situation he gave you $500 and

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.190
said, "It's my wish that you would get a tattoo."

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.190
What would you get?

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.280
Dan: I would probably make sure that both
of us were getting a similar tattoo.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.389
Vanessa: Oh, I have to do it, too?

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:58.960
Dan: Yeah, of course.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.689
Because we're married, obviously.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:07.240
I love my wife a lot, so I'd have to be kind
of a bonding tattoo.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.229
Vanessa: So would the tattoo have to be the
same between us or do I just have to get a

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:13.400
tattoo at the same time?

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.600
Dan: It has to be similar.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.949
I'm thinking like I'd have like a tiger on
this arm, and then on your arm you'd have

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.089
another tiger, and they're like reaching for
each other.

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:26.189
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:28.639
Dan: Or maybe they shape a heart.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.620
Maybe the heart's too cheesy.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.970
Vanessa: It's a valiant idea.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:40.711
So for you, you said, "I would," or, "Maybe
I would get a tiger on one arm," and I would

00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.830
have to get a tiger on the other arm.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.440
You might notice that in this grammatical
sentence structure he used would to talk about

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.410
the hypothetical situation.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:08:00.629
But if he made a full sentence, if my brother
gave me, that verb gave is the past tense,

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:01.629
gave me.

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:07.650
If my brother gave me $500, I would ... So,
I want to know for you, can you make a sentence

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.659
using that same sentence structure?

00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:11.879
Do you need to draw some more?

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.879
Dan: Yes.

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.270
You got to be still now.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.270
Vanessa: Okay.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.270
I'm going to try to be still.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.270
Dan: Okay.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.270
Here we go.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.270
Vanessa: What would you get?

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.270
So make sure that you're using the past tense
here.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.749
Let's talk about another question.

00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:34.710
If the tattoo were words, if you were forced
to get a tattoo with words, which words would

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.430
get on your arm?

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.490
It could be in English.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.550
It could be in another language.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.380
What tattoo would you get?

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.479
I guess it doesn't have to be on your arm.

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.589
It could be on your back, on your leg, on
your foot.

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:49.910
It could be something that's hidden.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:55.490
But, I want to know for you, what tattoo would
you get?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.010
A lot of you are giving really great answer.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:03.880
Some of you said, "I would like to get a tattoo
of my cats if my brother gave me $500."

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880
Dan: Aw.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.970
Vanessa: Beautiful sentence.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:11.029
In the sample sentence, those of you who are
following live ... Those of you who are following

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:13.839
live are writing sample sentences at the moment.

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:16.240
Thanks so much.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.180
You said the past tense, if my brother gave
me.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:26.560
I want to let you know here that in this sample
sentence I just said that if clause is at

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.630
the end of the sentence, but you could also
put it in the beginning of the sentence.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:38.649
If my brother gave me $500, I would get a
tiger tattoo.

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:41.850
Or we could say the if clause at the end.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:48.209
I would get a tiger tattoo if my brother gave
me $500.

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:53.210
So here we've got two different places in
the sentences that you could add that if phrase.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.680
So, it's a little bit flexible.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.130
Really, there's no difference in the meaning.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.490
That's just your personal preference.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:06.060
Some of you who are following live said, "I'd
like to get a butterfly tattoo.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.990
I'd get a tattoo with the word Beatles on
it.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.779
I'd get a tattoo that said world peace."

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:14.440
Aw, these are really-
Dan: Ah, world peace.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.040
Vanessa: ... beautiful ideas.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.529
So you like the Beatles, you would get a Beatles
tattoo.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.230
You want world peace, you would get a world
peace tattoo.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.230
I love it.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:33.149
Now, I want to ask you, Dan, what if your
brother gave you $500 and said, "You have

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:37.300
to get a tattoo on your chest"?
Dan: On my chest.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.230
Vanessa: So it's a little bit more obvious.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:45.779
It can really be hidden with a shirt, and
it has to be at least the size of your hand.

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:46.970
What tattoo would you get?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.720
Would it be different or would it be the same?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.380
Dan: Yeah, I think I would have the same tattoo.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.380
Vanessa: Oh, a tiger?

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.850
Dan: Yeah, something similar.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.480
It would also have to be very abstract.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.870
Vanessa: Oh, it's not going to be like a literal
picture of a tiger.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.209
Dan: Yeah, it wouldn't be a real picture.

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:08.779
It'd have to be kind of artistic, maybe some
swirls or sharp corners.

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:09.779
I don't know.

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:11.870
It has to look ... I think we call those a
tribal tattoo.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.610
Vanessa: Oh, I see what you mean, so just
like-

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.610
Dan: Maybe.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.160
Vanessa: ... some sharp lines, not really
colors or a clear image.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Dan: Yeah.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.319
Vanessa: Okay, so we-
Dan: Even on my chest I'd do something similar.

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:24.120
Vanessa: So we-
Dan: Although I wouldn't be happy.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.769
I don't know that would look very good.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.769
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:28.870
Dan: Chest tattoo.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:34.010
Vanessa: Might be a little bit odd for you,
because you don't have any other tattoos.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.370
Dan: Even more odd for you.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.370
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.310
It would be really, really odd.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:44.710
Well, I like that in Dan's sentence he said,
"I'd get the same tattoo."

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:52.560
He's using the contraction here, I would get,
but instead he said, "I'd get."

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.089
This is one of the most common ways to say
I would.

00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:59.160
I'd get a tiger tattoo.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.070
I'd like to order the hamburger, please.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.910
I'd like some coffee, please.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:06.960
I'd like.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.100
So, we're using that contraction I would and
making it I'd.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.920
I'd like a tiger tattoo.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:24.361
For me, I think that if my sister gave me
$500 and I had to get a tattoo ... This is

00:12:24.361 --> 00:12:28.519
a tough question, because I don't have any
tattoos, and there's a reason why I don't

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:32.440
have any tattoos, because I feel like it's
so permanent.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:38.000
My interests are always changing and my passions,
when I feel passionate about something, I

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.120
feel really passionate about it.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.120
But then, maybe I feel really passionate about
something different after a couple months.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.019
So to have a tattoo, it feels like that passion
needs to be long-lasting and be something

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:54.470
that continues for most of my life.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.550
Dan: That's why we have to get a couple tattoo.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.830
Vanessa: But even then, it's a little scary.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.209
Dan: She's not going to be with me forever.

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:02.690
That's what she's trying to say.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.879
Vanessa: I hope so.

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:05.560
I hope we're together forever.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.819
But, it's a little bit risky, you know?

00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:12.730
So, I feel like for me I'd get ... I'm using
that contraction.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:21.459
I'd get a tattoo of maybe the world, and maybe
highlight some places that are meaningful

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:28.120
to me, so maybe some places that I've lived,
maybe the place that I grew up in the US,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.920
maybe have a little special color for the
place I grew up in the US, or the city where

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.550
I studied abroad in the UK, or maybe where
I lived in France, or where we lived in Korea.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.629
Those places have really special meanings
to me.

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:45.080
I feel like that meaning isn't going to change
over time.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080
Dan: Yeah.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.019
Maybe you could color in the new countries
you visit.

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:51.780
Vanessa: Oh, it's kind of like a map that
I just color in as I visit new places.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780
Dan: Yeah.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.600
Then eventually you have to color in the whole
world.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.060
Vanessa: Oh, that could be an interesting
idea.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:02.620
I guess if I did that, I could get a circle
because you couldn't see all the places.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.779
I'd have to be-
Dan: I needs to be on your back.

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:06.620
Vanessa: Oh, a giant map.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.210
Dan: Like the map behind us.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.329
Vanessa: Like this map just on my back.

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:13.610
So, I want to know for you, do you have any
tattoos?

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.540
If not, what kind of tattoo would you get?

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.000
Maybe for you, you would decide not to get
a tattoo at all.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.970
Dan: Yeah, speaking of tattoos-
Vanessa: Yeah, how is ...

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.089
Dan: ... your tattoo is complete.

00:14:25.089 --> 00:14:27.009
Vanessa: My tattoo is complete.

00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:28.019
Dan: It's done.

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:29.220
Vanessa: All right.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.220
Dan: It's simple.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.220
Vanessa: It's simple.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.220
Okay.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.220
Dan: It's kind of ugly, too.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.019
Vanessa: Well, the good news is it's temporary.

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:37.449
So, I'm going to show you.

00:14:37.449 --> 00:14:38.699
Dan: The big reveal.

00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:43.350
Vanessa: The big reveal what Dan drew on my
arm.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.680
Are you ready?

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.790
Dan: Are you ready?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.880
Vanessa: I don't know.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.880
Whoa.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.519
Dan: Oh, that's so crooked, now that I look
at it.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.519
Vanessa: I love English.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.930
All right.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.700
I don't know if it's-
Dan: It's a true statement.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.410
Vanessa: ... if it's reversed for you.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.670
But for me, it's the right way.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.170
Dan: Yeah, it looks reversed on this video.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.170
Vanessa: Oh, it's okay.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.000
Dan: I don't know if it's reversed for you
guys.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.519
Vanessa: Well, for you, it's clear.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:10.519
For me it's clear.

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:14.370
You can see that I love English.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.370
Well, thank you.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.850
Dan: Cupid has shot her heart and said, "She
loves English."

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.850
Vanessa: Wow.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:25.930
Well, if you have ever gotten a temporary
tattoo or a henna tattoo, like this, it only

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:32.560
stays for maybe a week, maybe two weeks if
you're lucky, at least in my experience.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.339
So, it won't be there for very long.

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:39.779
But, it will be enjoyable while it lasts.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:40.779
Dan: Enjoyable, yes.

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:41.779
Vanessa: Yes.

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:44.550
Dan: It was difficult because you were moving
a little bit.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.550
Vanessa: Oh.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.550
Dan: That's why it's not good.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.550
Vanessa: That's why.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.550
I'm sure.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.550
Dan: That's the only reason.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.550
Vanessa: I'm sure.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.550
Yes.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.040
Well, thank you so much for your hard work
making this tattoo.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.709
I hope that for you you got to use some of
these hypothetical if sentences.

00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:06.880
If I got a tattoo, it would be a heart.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.880
Dan: A heart.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880
Vanessa: That says-
Dan: That says I love English.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.920
Vanessa: ... I love English.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.920
I'm sorry, Dan.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.160
In reality, I would never get this tattoo.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.770
I'm glad it's temporary.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.519
Dan: You don't love my art?

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:23.589
Vanessa: But I appreciate that it's temporary.

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:25.819
Dan: Me, too, actually.

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:26.930
Vanessa: Yes.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.940
So, thank you for being willing to do this
spontaneously.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:37.529
If you would like to continue to learn English
with me and continue to learn English with

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:42.790
Dan ... Today's lesson was pretty silly, just
a fun, live lesson, a good interaction where

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:49.470
you can learn English for 20 minutes, challenge
yourself to hear something live, not planned,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.449
completely spontaneous.

00:16:52.449 --> 00:17:02.170
I'd like to let you know, if you would like
to join me to speak about tattoos, you can

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.510
join Alana where we talk about about tattoos.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:14.110
For the month of October, 2018, you're going
to learn vocabulary with Dan and I.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:21.290
We have a one-hour vocabulary lesson every
month talking about the vocabulary that was

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.400
used in the conversation.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.510
You're also going to learn some important
grammar points and pronunciation as well.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:35.419
So, I hope that you'll really be able to master
English and practice as much as possible.

00:17:35.419 --> 00:17:40.710
A lot of members also join our private Facebook
group and speak together.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:46.480
That's one of the benefits, is that you get
to meet really dedicated English learners.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.250
We have a live lesson every Sunday on Facebook
for members of the Fearless Fluency Club.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.260
Dan: Members only.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.260
Vanessa: Yes.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.950
I hope that you can join me and my tattoo
and that you can enjoy learning English in

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.090
a fun way.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.289
Thanks so much for joining me today.

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:03.400
Thanks, Dan-
Dan: You're welcome.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.799
Vanessa: ... for joining me.

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.179
Pretty silly lesson today, but I hope that
you enjoyed it.

00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:12.580
Make sure that you subscribe so that you can
get future lessons every Friday.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:18.559
You can join us here on YouTube, and you can
become my personal student in the Fearless

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:19.559
Fluency Club.

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:20.840
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.000
I'll see you again the next time.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Bye.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.002
Dan: Bye.
