00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.620
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.129
Are you ready to have a conversation?

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:07.229
Dan: I am.

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:14.410
Vanessa: Let's do it.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.930
For today's English lesson, I'm here in front
of my Christmas tree with my husband, Dan-

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.930
Dan: Hello, everyone.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.269
Vanessa: ... in our matching Christmas sweaters.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.800
Dan: Looking sharp.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.519
Vanessa: Yes, we are drinking some port today.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.519
Cheers.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.949
Dan: Cheers.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.190
Vanessa: And we're going to be talking about
nine conversation questions that are great

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.390
for getting to know someone better.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.079
Some of these questions are silly.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.079
Some of them are deep.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.570
Some of them are serious and we're going to
be asking them to each other.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.520
I hope it will be a great opportunity for
you to listen to some real English, but also

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.870
to expand your vocabulary and be able to learn
some new expressions.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.550
If we say anything interesting, then I'll
try to write it up here so that you can learn

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.640
as you go and improve your English skills.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.260
Are you ready for the first question?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.160
Dan: I'm ready, I think.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.390
Vanessa: Okay.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.170
The first question is what was the most embarrassing
moment of your life?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.170
Dan: Wow.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.380
This is going to go right straight for the
gut.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.380
Vanessa: Yep.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.200
Dan: This is a pretty tough question I think.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.910
The most embarrassing moment of my life.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.360
Well, it depends.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.220
When I was a child, I had a very embarrassing
moment where I was about to sing in my choir

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.140
at church, and I stepped up to the microphone
and I didn't know that if I got too close,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.890
it would have all this feedback and noise
and stuff.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.810
And I got too close and it made a bunch of
fuzzy sounds.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.900
And I remember distinctly a girl who was in
the choir said, "You don't have to eat the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900
mic, Dan."

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.900
Vanessa: Oh.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.900
Dan: She said something like that.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.900
Vanessa: In front of everyone?

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.900
Dan: And everybody was laughing.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.900
Vanessa: Oh.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.220
Dan: So that was a really embarrassing moment.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.220
Vanessa: How old were you?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.220
Dan: Like seven, eight.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.220
Vanessa: Ah, that's bad.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.220
Dan: Yeah.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.770
So I was a little kid there.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.500
And then see, I have two most embarrassing
moments.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.680
So I got a lot of embarrassment to go around.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.390
But this is actually pretty similar.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.770
So the second most embarrassing, maybe number
one, would be when I failed the speech in

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.700
speech class in university.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.760
Vanessa probably remembers this.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.760
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.230
Dan: So I stayed up all night trying to finish
my speech and I'm a bit of a perfectionist

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.230
sometimes.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.080
And I was just working on it way too long
and I didn't sleep at all.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.450
And then when I got into the school room and
started the presentation, I could not remember

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.790
anything at all.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.150
So I just stood up there like this, and I
couldn't say anything.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.520
And everybody in the room had this look of
horror like, "Oh, my God, he doesn't remember

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520
anything."

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.681
Vanessa: This is called secondhand embarrassment
when you're embarrassed for someone else.

00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:58.681
Dan: Yes.

00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:02.680
Everybody was embarrassed for me and I felt
so embarrassed and terrible, and I had to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.620
leave the room and then I kind of fumbled
my way through it later.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.620
But yeah.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.620
So some advice out there, if you have a speech,
practice it, number one, and number two, sleep.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.620
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.200
I remember you said, too, at the end of that
class, everyone kind of patted you on the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.200
shoulder.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200
Dan: They're like, "It's okay."

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200
Vanessa: That's really embarrassing.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.640
And they're both kind of public speaking type
situations.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640
Dan: Yeah.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.270
These are probably the top embarrassing moments.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.160
Public speaking makes me nervous anyways,
if you can believe it.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160
I'm sure that you're not alone.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.460
In fact, that is one of my most embarrassing
moments, too.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.600
Dan: Oh, really?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.450
Vanessa: In fact, it was during a theater
practice.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.030
I was one of the lead roles in our high school
play.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.459
Dan: Of course, you were.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.380
Vanessa: And the problem was that during rehearsals,
during that time period, those weeks, I broke

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.610
my wrist.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.810
So I had a lot of doctor's appointments and
I missed a lot of rehearsals.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.410
So one day I went to the rehearsal and I was
on the stage.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.410
There was no audience.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.870
It was just the other classmates who were
in the play and my teacher was in the audience.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.310
And I didn't know it, but we were supposed
to memorize all of our lines on that day.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.310
Dan: Uh-oh.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.250
Vanessa: But I didn't know it because I had
missed so many rehearsals.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.060
And so I got on the stage with my playbook
and I was reading my lines because I didn't

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.169
know we were supposed to memorize them.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.950
And she yelled at me so much.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.360
She was screaming at me.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.300
This is not a good teacher situation in the
first place-

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300
Dan: Yeah.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.480
Vanessa: ... but she was yelling at me, "Vanessa,
why didn't you remember your lines?"

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.639
And I stood there and the only thing I could
do was just cry.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.639
Dan: Oh, no.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.570
Vanessa: And I just cried in front of everyone
on the stage.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.570
Dan: Oh, my God.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.130
Vanessa: I was so ashamed and embarrassed-
Dan: That sounds so bad.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.900
Vanessa: ... and I was embarrassed that I
was crying.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.780
It was just a really bad situation all around.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.720
Dan: I hope that teacher felt bad.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.680
Vanessa: I don't know.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.050
She wasn't the nicest person if you can imagine.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.050
Dan: Yeah.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.500
She probably reveled in it, too, like, "Heh,
heh, I got one."

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.640
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.220
So that was probably my most embarrassing
moments.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.389
All right, let's go to our second question.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.389
Dan: All right.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.720
The next question is, if you found out that
you were the direct descendant of a king or

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.670
a queen, would you find them and claim your
title or would you keep your life as it is?

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.590
Vanessa: There is no question, no doubt in
my mind.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.940
I would absolutely, what do you think I'm
going to say?

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.270
Dan: Oh, you would find out.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.290
Vanessa: Really?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.830
Dan: Oh, no.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.830
Am I wrong?

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.830
Vanessa: No.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.440
I would absolutely keep my life as it is.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.169
Dan: Wow, okay.

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.150
Vanessa: I think that I am not famous at all
on YouTube.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.250
YouTube is a very small-
Dan: I don't know about that.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.980
Vanessa: ... the internet is a very small
piece of the world.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.750
Dan: It's not like being a princess.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:03.010
Vanessa: But I think if I were very, very
extremely famous on the internet or like Hollywood

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.510
or something like this, I would feel so uncomfortable
because you can't have a daily life.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.850
You can't go to the grocery store.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.320
You can't walk down the street with your children.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.880
You just can't live a normal life without
people looking at you or even potentially

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.889
hurting you, or you just can't be normal.

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.740
And I would never want that for myself, I
think.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.470
Dan: You wouldn't even want to go meet your
royal family?

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.030
Vanessa: Well, I think the part of this question
is claim your title or claim your throne.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.350
I would not want to rule or just become famous
and then never be able to have a private life.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.970
That's something that's really important to
me.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.940
And thankfully, it's something that is possible
due to just the widespreadness of the internet,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.370
even though there's many of you who watch
these lessons, you're spread out across the

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.370
world.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.790
So it's not really a problem that I face in
daily life.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.180
I can still go about my life without being
recognized, which is great.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.930
So I think having a private life is really
important to me.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.861
And that's, I think, what people who are celebrities
or kings and queens don't have.

00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:11.419
They don't have a private life.

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:12.419
Dan: That's true.

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:13.419
Vanessa: So what about you?

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:14.419
Would you claim your throne?

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:15.669
Dan: Yeah, definitely.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:16.669
Of course.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.290
Daniel, King of Scots.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.810
Vanessa: Oh, why would you want to do that?

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.550
Dan: For Ireland, maybe?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.850
I don't know.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.640
Well, because number one, I would just be
very curious.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.130
Oh, what's the story here?

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.130
How did they find out?

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.430
I want to meet these people.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.750
I also think it would be kind of advantageous
to be living as a normal person for most of

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.670
my existence and then suddenly find out.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:47.210
That'd be more like a movie type of scene,
not so much like I was born into royalty and

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:53.190
I have all these procedures and all this fame
from birth and everything was given to me.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.039
No, suddenly one day I find out I'm a prince
or something like that.

00:07:58.039 --> 00:07:59.039
Vanessa: Oh.

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.039
Dan: I'd be far too curious.

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:03.130
And also maybe, I don't know.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.801
Vanessa: You always live with, what if?

00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:05.801
What if I asked?

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:08.300
Dan: Well, I was going to say, maybe I like
fame more than you.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.630
Maybe I like the idea of it or influence.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:17.500
I like the idea of influence, like maybe I
could use that position for good in the world.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.020
Vanessa: Well, I mean, that's not a bad thing.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.300
You'd be able to probably influence more people
than in your private life-

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.300
Dan: Exactly.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.340
Vanessa: ... but you'd give up your private
life at the same time.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.860
All right, let's go to our next question.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.029
Our next question is to name four things that
we have in common.

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:35.519
Now I'm going to say one, you're going to
say one, then I'll say one, then you say one.

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.089
Dan: We haven't practiced this, so we better
really know each other.

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.089
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:40.729
What is something that we have in common?

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.630
Dan: Well, we both like to go on adventures.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.850
Vanessa: Okay, yeah.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.470
What kind of adventures?

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.100
Dan: We like to travel.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.949
We really enjoyed our time when we traveled
to South Korea and living in a different country,

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:57.079
eating different food-
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:57.079 --> 00:09:00.559
Dan: ... those experiences, we both enjoy
about the same.

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.569
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:04.869
Dan: Neither of us are prone to complaining
about it.

00:09:04.869 --> 00:09:06.089
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:09.199
Dan: We endure the differences very well.

00:09:09.199 --> 00:09:10.199
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:15.860
I would say that another similarity that we
have kind of going with this adventure idea

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.290
is that we both like to be active.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.660
So we often, as a family, go for hikes, or
even if it's just a walk around the neighborhood,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:29.339
this doesn't seem like it's extremely active,
but I know a lot of people who never go for

00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:31.019
a walk.

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:35.639
So I think something that we have in common
is that we really like to move.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:38.519
We're not extremely active, but we-
Dan: Kind of similar to the first.

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.519
Vanessa: Yes.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.920
But I think this has to do with-
Dan: A little bit.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.990
Vanessa: ... exercise and that we chose our
house because we can walk to downtown, because

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.640
we can walk to the park, and a lot of places
in the US that's not possible.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.640
Dan: Yeah.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.040
Vanessa: So I think that that's something
we have in common.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.810
Dan: We have a similar taste in that way.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.810
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.810
Yeah.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.810
What do you think?

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.810
What's another thing we have in common?

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.839
Dan: Well, I think both of us, this is something
that we both dislike.

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:02.920
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.920
Dan: Yeah.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.499
We both really dislike phony people.

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:07.499
Vanessa: Oh, that's a good one.

00:10:07.499 --> 00:10:08.499
Yeah.

00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:12.139
Dan: Fake people or dishonest people.

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:17.139
We just really don't hang out with people
who are fake in any way, really.

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:18.139
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:22.029
Dan: And we can tell, or even like, I don't
know, really full of themselves.

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:23.050
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.440
Dan: We like genuine people-
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440
Dan: ... like us.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.089
Vanessa: I think that when you surround yourself
with people like that, people who are fake

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:37.490
or shallow, then it really influences you
personally.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:43.690
So by having people around you who you enjoy
and are a positive influence, that can really

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.690
shape your life.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.690
Dan: Yeah.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.690
I have a bonus one.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:47.690
Vanessa: Oh, I'm not done.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.690
Dan: I know.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.690
Vanessa: What if it's mine?

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.690
Dan: We're very fashionable.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.870
Vanessa: We like-
Dan: ... high fashion-

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.060
Vanessa: ... high fashions, cat sweaters.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.420
Very, yeah, maybe we have a low embarrassment
threshold.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.110
Dan: Me more than you.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.110
Vanessa: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.110
I'd say so.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.680
Maybe that's high embarrassment threshold?

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.680
Dan: Yes.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.899
Vanessa: We're not embarrassed easily.

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:12.189
We're not embarrassed easily because we can
wear sweaters like this on the internet.

00:11:12.189 --> 00:11:13.189
Okay.

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:15.050
Dan: Okay your real last one, sorry.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.050
Vanessa: Yes.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:24.889
So my final one is that I think we are both
really good at rationally communicating our

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:26.209
thoughts to each other.

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:34.529
So this is not 100% of the time, but I think
that our relationship works really well because

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:38.959
when I get upset about something or you're
bothered by something, or even life's just

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:44.939
going well, we can kind of put on our rational
thinking hats-

00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:48.249
Dan: Set aside our biases for a minute.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.249
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:49.249 --> 00:11:53.829
And even if it's really difficult, try to
rationally communicate with each other and

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:57.989
kind of set aside emotion or set aside, yeah,
that kind of bias.

00:11:57.989 --> 00:11:58.989
Dan: Yeah.

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:00.649
Vanessa: And that doesn't work 100% of the
time, of course.

00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:05.480
But I think that we are both kind of naturally
good at that, but we've also worked on that

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480
a lot.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.709
We're also pretty lucky because neither of
us have extremely high negative emotion.

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:14.689
So we don't yell at each other very much.

00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:18.309
We don't feel very angry that often.

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:22.470
Or if we do, it's not the way some people
are when they're angry.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.470
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.470
Dan: Let's just put it that way.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.470
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.189
So I think that that's something we have in
common is that we communicate in a similar

00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:29.189
way to each other.

00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:30.600
All right, let's go to our next question.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600
Dan: Okay.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.290
The next question is what would constitute
a perfect day for you?

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.290
Vanessa: Perfect.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.290
Wow.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.629
Well, I think when I saw this question, I
kind of thought about a pretty realistically

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:50.759
perfect day, not I win the lottery and then
I get to fly around the world.

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:53.470
This is not realistic.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.579
So when I thought about a perfect day, I start
at the beginning of the day.

00:12:57.579 --> 00:13:02.029
I think the perfect day would be, I wake up,
no children are crying.

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:04.540
Dan: I'm just going to say no children.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.930
Vanessa: No children are crying because Dan
has woken up and is giving them breakfast.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.980
And he has already prepared a wonderful breakfast
of oatmeal-

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.980
Dan: Oh, this is detailed.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.980
Vanessa: ... and-
Dan: Oatmeal?

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.129
Vanessa: We eat oatmeal every morning.

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.410
Dan: How about bacon and eggs?

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.410
Vanessa: Okay.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.489
There's bacon and eggs.

00:13:20.489 --> 00:13:27.319
And I wake up at a nice, not too early hour
and I get to eat this wonderful breakfast.

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:28.920
And we go for a family hike.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920
Dan: Is this just at our house?

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920
Dan: Okay.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.420
We go for a family hike in the mountains all
morning and afternoon and have a picnic on

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.420
the mountain.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:45.170
And then in the afternoon, we come back and
our children magically are just playing so

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.100
peacefully while we prepare dinner together.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.100
Dan: Wow.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.100
Oh, together.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.100
Vanessa: I think it would be fun, too, yeah.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.759
We like to cook together, but we often don't
get a chance to cook together because one

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:56.850
of us is watching the kids while the other
is cooking.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:04.059
So I think it would be lovely, a very realistic
day, minus some of the children things, too.

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:05.059
Yeah.

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:10.649
They're playing nicely and happy and we cook
together and they go to bed so peacefully.

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:14.889
And in the evening, we play our favorite board
game, which is Carcassonne.

00:14:14.889 --> 00:14:15.889
Dan: Oh, okay.

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:16.889
Vanessa: And I win.

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.569
Dan: Oh, come on.

00:14:18.569 --> 00:14:19.930
Vanessa: Perfect day.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.930
Dan: Wow.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.170
That's a very humble perfect day.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.170
Vanessa: Yeah?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.290
Dan: You don't even go anywhere.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.420
Vanessa: Oh, we go hiking.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.420
Dan: Okay.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.420
Well, we go somewhere.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.420
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.420
What about you?

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.420
What's the perfect day for you?

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.420
Dan: Okay.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.420
Well, mine is-
Vanessa: I have a feeling it's a little more

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.420
extravagant.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.519
Dan: ... a little bit, yeah maybe a little
bit more.

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:36.519
Vanessa: Okay.

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:38.869
Dan: So we'd be traveling somewhere.

00:14:38.869 --> 00:14:39.869
So say Japan.

00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:44.939
I've been having like a itch to go visit Japan,
but I know it's not going to happen for a

00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:48.620
long time because it's far away and we have
little kids.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.369
So you have one of those like perfect travel
days where you're not too tired.

00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:56.449
You do something really interesting.

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:59.170
So maybe we see-
Vanessa: A temple.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:04.079
Dan: Well, I love nature, so some of my favorite
hikes in South Korea were going up mountains

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:09.589
by like old walls, old city walls, some kind
of hike like that.

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:10.819
And it's beautiful weather.

00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:15.481
And we stop by a delicious restaurant and
I'd be with our kids.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:18.779
Our kids would be older and everybody would
be having a great time.

00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:23.189
They would also be holding my arm and say,
"Thanks, Dad, for sending us here.

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:24.189
It's great.

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:25.389
We love it."

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:31.610
And everybody would give me a kiss, my children
and my wife that is, and all the Japanese

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.610
people, too.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.199
And then we'd jump on a dragon and fly off
into the sky.

00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:37.449
Vanessa: Wow.

00:15:37.449 --> 00:15:39.939
That was really amazing.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:43.360
Dan: And that's my perfect day.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.300
Vanessa: Especially the dragon part.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.300
Okay.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.959
Well, maybe I've had a couple sips of port
too much, but that was a wonderful day.

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.999
All right, let's go to our next question.

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:59.019
Our next question is a little more serious
and it is what questions do you think that

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:03.290
partners should ask each other before getting
married?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.209
So we've been married for 10 years.

00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:06.209
Dan: Whoa.

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:08.249
Vanessa: 10, almost 10 and a half years.

00:16:08.249 --> 00:16:09.249
Dan: Would you believe it, internet?

00:16:09.249 --> 00:16:10.249
Vanessa: I know.

00:16:10.249 --> 00:16:11.930
It's amazing.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:16.600
So we have a little experience, not as much
experience as a lot of people who've been

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.410
married a lot longer than us, but what do
you think?

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.410
Yeah.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.290
What's some things that couples should ask
each other?

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.610
Dan: Just one question or there's just one
question.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.610
Vanessa: What questions.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.610
Dan: Okay.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.939
Vanessa: Don't say all of them because I have
to answer, too.

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:36.509
Dan: Well, I would probably start with, "If
you're thinking about marriage, do you want

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:37.509
children?"

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:38.509
Vanessa: Hmm.

00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:39.509
Dan: There you go.

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:40.509
And, "How many kids do you want?"

00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:41.509
Vanessa: Okay.

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:46.279
Dan: Because if one person wants zero and
one person wants one or any variation of that,

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:50.430
it's usually if somebody doesn't want any
kids, then that could be a brick wall where

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.430
you don't want to go any further.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.509
Vanessa: We call that a deal-breaker-
Dan: A deal-breaker.

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:54.509
Vanessa: ... a deal-breaker.

00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:55.509
Yep.

00:16:55.509 --> 00:17:00.609
Dan: And then number two would be money, like,
what's your money expectations, who's going

00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:02.499
to work, when, how much are they going to
work.

00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:04.780
Vanessa: Ah, like how much money are you going
to make?

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.780
Dan: Yeah.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.780
Vanessa: Those expectations?

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.360
Dan: Or even how much you spend on stuff?

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.640
Like, what's your goals financially?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.760
Do you have financial goals, period?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760
Vanessa: Okay.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.000
Dan: That's what your dad asked me.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.030
Vanessa: And when did you say?

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.840
Dan: I said, "I don't know, sir."

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840
Vanessa: But you know what?

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:26.440
That's one of our communication things that
we have communicated and step-by-step grown

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.160
together and figured it out.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.950
Dan: And I left you with the harder ones.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:30.950
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.950
Dan: Yeah.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.950
Do you have anything after that?

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.600
Vanessa: I think that it's kind of connected
to yours.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:41.600
The first one is, I think it's really important
to talk about your expectations for your roles,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.940
specifically gender roles.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:53.300
And a lot of us maybe have parents who have
a traditional gender role situation where

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:59.460
the father goes to work and the mother stays
with the children, but for our generation,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.680
it's not exactly always like that.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.750
There's a lot of variations of that.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.650
So for us, we both take care of our children
and we both teach you English and work on

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.850
this English teaching business.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.190
So our life is a lot different than what our
parents traditionally had.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.190
Dan: Yeah.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:20.760
Vanessa: So I think that it would be important
to talk about what do you expect me to do?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.380
What do you expect you to do?

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.630
What do I expect of myself?

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:29.360
And then, in different stages of life, when
we have kids, what do we expect to do?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.030
If we're going to have kids, what do we expect?

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.000
So I think that those roles in general are
good to talk about.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.810
But even more specifically, I remember when
we first got married, this might be a little

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:46.240
strong to say, but one of the best things
we did was just to say, "I do the dishes,

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.440
you do the laundry."

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440
Like this is so simple.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440
Dan: Clear separation.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.310
But just having a really clear delegation
of this is my task, this is your task.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.050
And we're still working on that because every
stage in life is a little bit different.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:05.740
But I think that having this accepted and
talked about role is really important instead

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.380
of just assuming, "Oh yeah, she's going to
do it.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.380
Oh yeah.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.380
He's going to do that."

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.150
No, you should talk about it because it's
always evolving and changing.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.150
So yeah.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.610
I think you should talk about your roles.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.610
All right.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.610
Let's talk about our next question.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:23.640
Dan: The next question is your house catches
on fire and you are running out the door and

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.670
you can only grab one thing.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.740
What would it be and why?

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.610
Vanessa: I think that there's more to this
question.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.610
Dan: Is there?

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.440
Vanessa: It says after saving your loved ones
and all of your pets, you can make a final-

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.710
Dan: That's a given.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.950
Vanessa: ... a final dash into your house
safely.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.580
So we want to exclude all of these situations.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.680
Your kids are safe.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680
Your loved ones are safe.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.850
Your pets are safe and you can safely get
something else.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.850
What would it be?

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:49.850
Dan: Okay.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.450
Everybody else is out of the house already-
Vanessa: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.130
Dan: ... including your little cat and dog
and your fish.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.000
Vanessa: Yes, so what is, basically we're
talking about an item, what is something that

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.560
you would grab.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.180
Oh boy.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:08.010
I think for some reason, my first instinct
with this question is to say in our closet

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:17.780
there is a box of my pictures from growing
up, of my journals from growing up.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.780
Yeah.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.400
These kind of personal mementos and it's all
in one box.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.520
So maybe it's kind of cheating because I can
take the whole box.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.470
But I think that maybe I would take this.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.110
I don't know in reality what I would actually
grab.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.080
I'd probably grab something random, like a
house plant that I don't care about.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.670
I think in that moment of panic, you'd probably
do something not rational.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.570
Dan: Can your phone be considered a loved
one?

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.140
Because I just automatically grab that.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.770
Vanessa: Is your phone a loved one?

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.320
Dan: Well, I mean, if I'm only going to grab
one thing-

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.600
Vanessa: At the table and-
Dan: ... like the second I get out of bed,

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.060
my hand would just grab the phone.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.260
I don't think it counts.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.150
Vanessa: So are you saying that like-
Dan: We're excluding our phone.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.190
Vanessa: ... if your phone is a loved one,
that at the family table, you have a chair

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.020
for you, a chair for your wife, a chair for
your kid and a chair for your phone, because

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.020
it's a loved one?

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.850
Dan: Yeah, in the baby chair.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.810
Vanessa: In the baby chair, okay.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.810
All right.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:13.810
Dan: Anyway.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.260
Vanessa: So what would you bring if you-
Dan: Besides my phone?

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.010
Vanessa: Besides your phone, I guess.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.010
Dan: Okay.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.010
Vanessa: What would you take?

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.430
Dan: Well, so I'd probably be pretty practical.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.720
I think I'd grab a box full of hard drives,
external hard drives.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.930
Dan: Because we have all Vanessa's old videos
that are not backed up on the internet and

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.070
all kinds of pictures that we don't have anywhere.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.070
Vanessa: That's true.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.790
Dan: And it's digital, but it's not on the
cloud.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:46.250
I wouldn't probably even grab a computer now
because most of the stuff is online in some

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.880
way or easily re-accessed.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.920
Vanessa: Oh, like you can get your pictures
on Google Photos, but the pictures-

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.440
Dan: Not some of our old pictures.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.290
Vanessa: ... pictures that are on the hard
drive, you can't get.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.860
Dan: All of our pictures from South Korea.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.860
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.860
All of that kind of stuff.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.860
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.860
Vanessa: Which kind of makes me think maybe
we should back that up.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.860
Dan: Yeah, maybe we should, yeah.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.860
Maybe, yeah.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.060
Vanessa: Maybe we should put it in the cloud
somewhere or think about that.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.060
Yeah.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.890
Well, thank you YouTube video for making us
think about that.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.340
Dan: My phone already ran out the door, so
don't worry about-

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.340
Vanessa: Okay.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.340
Dan: ... him or her?

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.340
Vanessa: Your loved one?

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.340
Dan: They.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.530
Vanessa: Oh, all right.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.430
Let's go to our next question.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:22.840
The next question is a more personal one and
it is what is something that most people would

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.640
find surprising about you?

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.750
And when I say most people, I'm talking about
people who are watching here.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:36.740
So those of you who are watching this video,
you've probably learned a lot about us personally

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.390
by watching these English lessons, even though
you're also learning English.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.690
But what do you think is something that our
students would find surprising about you?

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:52.280
Dan: Yeah, I think it would probably be that
I can occasionally be a little bit, I don't,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:59.790
depressive is strong, but I can be somber
or melodramatic perhaps.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:00.790
Vanessa: Ah.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.790
Yeah.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.790
There's ebbs and flows in life.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.790
Dan: Yeah.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.920
Vanessa: And sometimes on those downs you
can be more sad.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.710
Dan: Probably more in my teens and 20s though.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:16.500
Since I've hit 30, I'm just stable as a rock,
as a boat in a still sea.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.500
Vanessa: Okay.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.500
Yeah.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.180
I think that just shows, too, though that
everybody has different sides of themselves

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.440
and is a real human-
Dan: Yeah.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.040
Vanessa: ... not just a silly, happy all the
time, very normal.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.150
Dan: I certainly present myself as very silly.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.960
I mean, I enjoy being silly and I'm actually
generally a happy person, but I even kind

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.580
of revel in sadness a little bit.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.690
Like I like to listen to sad songs a lot.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.840
And I like to just like think and like be
sad-

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.840
Vanessa: Just as an example-
Dan: ... be like not grumpy, just, yeah.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.900
I don't really know the right, it's not quite
sadness.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.590
It's more just like-
Vanessa: Blue.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.780
Dan: ... dramatic or blue.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.780
Yes.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.780
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:05.430
Just as an example, Dan likes to create playlists,
which are kind of like different songs that

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.940
he can listen to that are grouped together.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:13.170
And one of his playlists is songs for feeling
blue.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.400
So when Dan is feeling a little sad, he likes
to listen to sad music.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400
Dan: Yeah.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.750
Vanessa: And this is-
Dan: Or even when I'm feeling happy, honestly.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.750
Vanessa: Really?

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.750
Dan: Sure.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.750
Vanessa: Oh.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.750
This is absolutely not like me.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.750
Dan: I love sad music.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.200
Vanessa: I am not like that at all.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:32.240
When I feel sad, I'm trying to do everything
possible to get rid of the sadness, not to

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.240
kind of be in that moment.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.300
Dan: I'm not sure I've ever seen you sad.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.300
Vanessa: Really?

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.300
Dan: I mean, not often.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.300
Vanessa: Yeah, I guess so.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.300
Dan: We've been married 10 years.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.300
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.520
I think there's been-
Dan: She's not a low person at all.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.000
Vanessa: There's been very few times where-
Dan: I mean, you could probably tell.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.090
Vanessa: ... it's kind of stayed in my life.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.090
Dan: Yeah.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:51.960
Vanessa: Usually it's just a moment or like
it's usually more-

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.150
Dan: Usually when you drink wine.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.150
Vanessa: Uh-oh.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.370
Am I going to be-
Dan: That's the only times I can really remember

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.730
you saying-
Vanessa: Am I going to be blue?

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.640
Dan: ... "I feel like bummed," or sad or something.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640
Vanessa: Ah.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640
Dan: Yeah.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.120
Vanessa: Sometimes red wine especially makes
me feel a little bummed, but how I would answer

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.930
this question, something that you might find
surprising about me, is that I think that

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.630
I have a pretty strong nihilistic streak.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.870
This is-
Dan: But she's a very happy nihilist.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.870
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.150
So nihilism kind of means that you think it's
all pointless.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.720
There's no meaning.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.800
Why would this matter?

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.220
And kind of the feeling that there's no hope.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.220
Dan: Yeah.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.540
If I get charged up about politics or something,
she just kind of shrugs her shoulders.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.540
Vanessa: Right.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.780
Well, it's all, of course it's not going to
work.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.780
Of course everyone's corrupt.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.350
Dan: Yeah, the sun's going to die eventually.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.350
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:44.050
Nothing's going to happen like this kind of
negative outlook, but at the same time-

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.470
Dan: She's more cynical than you would expect.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.690
Vanessa: It doesn't make me feel depressed
to think like that.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.200
I try to find some hope in nihilism.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.950
Dan: Maybe Zen is a better word, yeah.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.320
Vanessa: Maybe by saying that-
Dan: Like a Buddhist kind of approach.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:07.190
Vanessa: ... if, for example, if I feel like
there's some big world concept that is potentially

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.010
going to ruin the world, I don't know.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.090
It's the year 2020.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.770
There has been many things like this.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:13.910
Dan: We're going down, folks.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.960
Vanessa: Many things that have happened this
year where everyone feels like the world is

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960
ending.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:26.450
But for me I feel like, "Okay, well, if everything
bad happens, the best thing I can do is to

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.300
maintain a positive family.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:38.220
And if my family is doing something positive,
the rest of the world might be going down,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.610
but this is my small circle of influence."

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.610
Dan: Yeah.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.040
Vanessa: "And I can influence this small circle
and that's about it."

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.040
So I feel, yeah, so sometimes I can feel nihilistic.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.250
Dan: But you're influencing them out there.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.250
Vanessa: Yes.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.760
But I think that-
Dan: Maybe a little bit?

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.760
I don't know.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:58.130
Vanessa: We have much more influence on our
family than we do on people on the internet.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.610
Dan: She doesn't do this YouTube thing for
influence necessarily.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:04.610
Vanessa: No.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.980
If I could do it anonymously, that would be
nice.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.510
Like I said, I want a private life.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.740
Dan: You do want to help people, though-
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.410
Dan: ... but it's like not in the influence
kind of way, if you know what I mean, lifestyle.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:16.410
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:22.370
Well, needless to say, I do have a nihilistic
streak in me, even though I do feel generally

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.370
pretty positive.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:29.160
I think I can maintain positivity even though
I do feel nihilistic about a lot of things.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.950
All right, let's go to our next question.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:37.890
Dan: The next question is if you could wake
up tomorrow and gain one quality or ability,

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:38.890
what would it be?

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:39.890
Vanessa: Hmm.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:45.400
It might be a little selfish to say this because
it's not one quality, but one ability that

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.110
I would like to have, can I choose something
magical?

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.110
Dan: Hmm.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.110
Okay.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.110
Yeah.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.180
Vanessa: Is I would love-
Dan: There are no rules here.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.180
Vanessa: Okay.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:59.610
I would love to be able to snap my fingers
and our family would appear in a different

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.610
location.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.610
Dan: Whoa.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.610
Oh, like-
Vanessa: This means that there is no need

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.610
for travel.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.610
Dan: ... teleportation.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:05.610
Vanessa: Yes.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.640
We could instantly, boom, be in Tokyo.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.930
Boom, be in Rio de Janeiro.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.890
Boom, be at my parents' house.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.480
Boom, be at your parents' house.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.550
Oh, wouldn't it be amazing.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.550
Dan: Your parents' house.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.550
Vanessa: Your parents' house.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:20.690
It would be so great because just that travel
process.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:25.740
I love, like we said, we like to travel and
go places and have adventures, but sometimes

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.870
the travel part of it, sometimes we say travel
is a curse.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:30.870
Dan: Yeah.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.420
Vanessa: We love to be there, but we don't
like to get there.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.730
Dan: I mean, it could be kind of fun.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.390
But planning for traveling is not fun.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.390
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.440
I'm sure there's plenty of other things that
I would actually really like to do if I had

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:46.240
a genie with a magic lamp and I could gain
one quality or ability, but this is the first

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.790
thing that came to my mind.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:52.570
And also I drank a couple sips of this wine,
port, so that was my answer.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.280
Dan: So, she wants to teleport to the wine
shop.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.840
Vanessa: No, I don't.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.780
We probably drink-
Dan: Is that what you do when you teleport?

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:05.230
Vanessa: I probably drink alcohol maybe once
a month, maybe less.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.910
Dan: Yeah, once a month is about right.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:07.910
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.710
Maybe one glass of wine once a month, so they
might say I'm a lightweight.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.940
What about you?

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.440
What is one quality or ability that you would
like to have?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.710
Dan: Hmm.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.800
So I was thinking about this and first I thought
invisibility.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.600
It's kind of cliche, but-
Vanessa: Classic.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.560
Dan: ... I think I would rather have, probably
a lot of you have watched Star Wars.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:34.500
Do you remember in the original Star Wars
where Ben Kenobi walks up to the Stormtrooper

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:39.260
and says, and he like waves his hand and basically
hypnotizes them and just like kind of makes

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.260
them do what he wants.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.260
Vanessa: Oh, my Gosh.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.210
Dan: "We are not the travelers you're looking
for."

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.210
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.210
He says something like that.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.210
Dan: That thing.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.970
"You will let me into the building."

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.040
I would do that.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.720
Vanessa: You already said you want to be king.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.420
You want to have influence, now you want people
to do what you want.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.320
Dan: No, it's not that I want to trick them.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.610
It's that I want to find out things.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.540
I would go to the White House and I would
go to the guards and I'd be like, "I belong

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.540
here."

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.320
And then I would go into-
Vanessa: In my cat sweater, I belong here.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.660
Dan: ... the White House and I'd go up to
Donald Trump for now.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.010
Eventually it will be Joe Biden, I guess,
or whoever.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.010
I don't know.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.890
And I'd be like, "I belong here."

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:16.890
Vanessa: Tell me all your secrets.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.390
Dan: Yeah.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.770
"You will tell me what you're really thinking."

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.910
Or I'd go up to like a CIA agent or something.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.870
"You will show me your secret vaults."

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.980
And then I would have all the knowledge and
then knowledge is power.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.680
Vanessa: And you would rule the world.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.210
Dan: No, I'd be like a journalist kind of
guy.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.880
I'd reveal it to the world.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.860
Unless what I found was so dangerous, which
I assume there's probably something super

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.860
dangerous out there.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.860
Then I'd be like, "Nevermind.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.760
I'm not sharing this with the world."

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.320
And everybody would go crazy.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320
Vanessa: Aha.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.600
Dan: Which is probably what they're thinking.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.760
Dan: See, this is where my mind goes.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.120
Vanessa: So I think we're kind of different
on this.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.820
Dan: So, maybe instant hypnotism.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.820
Hypnotism.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.700
Vanessa: Oh.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.150
As long as you are someone using your powers
for good.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.840
Dan: I would use it for good, guys.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.840
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.500
Because there's also a lot of bad that can
be done in that situation.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.500
Dan: That's true.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.500
"You will off the building."

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.090
Vanessa: "You will give me all of your money."

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.090
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.850
I didn't even think of that.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.850
Vanessa: Good.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:13.850
That's good.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.890
Dan: That's how you know I'd use my power
for good.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.890
Vanessa: Yes.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.130
Let's go to our last question.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:24.760
Our final question is what do you feel the
most grateful for in life?

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:30.520
Dan: I have only cliche answers for this,
but they're cliche because they're true.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:37.059
I am very grateful that I have a fantastic,
amazing wife.

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:38.559
Yeah, you guys have no idea.

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:40.059
Although you might have an idea.

00:31:40.059 --> 00:31:41.059
Hmm.

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:48.800
And healthy children, great children, fantastic
children, fantastic baby.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.890
And good health myself.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:50.910
There you go.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.910
Vanessa: That's great.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.910
Dan: That's the trifecta.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:53.910
Vanessa: Hmm.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.910
Yeah.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.480
Well, I was thinking those things-
Dan: And then she thought.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.210
Vanessa: Of course, I have a wonderful husband
and children, but I also think that-

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.650
Dan: She loves our minivan.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.780
Vanessa: It is this Christmas tree.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.780
I'm just kidding.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.310
It's not that Christmas tree.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:14.610
I think that something that kind of brings
all of this together is I'm very extremely

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.160
grateful for our job.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.860
Dan: I was going to say you guys.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.000
Vanessa: Well, you were highly included in
that because without you, we wouldn't have

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.010
a job teaching English.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.010
Dan: Yeah.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:31.340
Vanessa: But I think it's true that yes, we
can have a great husband or kids or health,

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.600
but if you can't spend time together, then
it's kind of sad, right?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600
Dan: Yes.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.700
Vanessa: So because of this job, we can work
from home.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:44.410
We can work for ourselves, If it's a beautiful
day outside, we throw away work and go outside

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.490
and go for a hike.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.440
If it's raining or an awful day outside, we
do work.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:54.120
So it's so flexible that, thanks to you, that
we can really spend time together.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.470
And that's what I love to do the most.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.470
Dan: Yeah.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:02.900
Vanessa: So being able to have this kind of
open-ended lifestyle, where we're doing something

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:09.290
that we like, something creative, where at
9:00 PM, 10:00 PM at night, we can sit in

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:15.300
front of our Christmas tree and drink wine
and ask silly questions to each other and

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.830
I hope you watch it, but we get to do that.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.430
And we also get to, because of that, we also
get to spend time with each other.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.300
So I think that I'm really grateful for this
job.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.300
So, thank you.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.300
Dan: Yeah.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.300
Vanessa: Thank you everyone.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.300
I'm grateful for you.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.730
Dan: And none of this would be possible without
the internet.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.730
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.120
Dan: So, really we should be grateful for
the internet.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.120
Vanessa: Wow.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.120
Thank you, internet.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.120
Yes.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.120
Dan: Thank you, internet.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.940
Vanessa: So on that note, I would like to
thank you so much for watching this conversation

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.510
and thank you, Dan, for joining me.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.510
Dan: You're welcome.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.140
I hope it wasn't too crazy.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.140
Vanessa: Yes.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:50.860
I hope this is interesting and useful to you
for vocabulary, for grammar, for your listening

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.050
skills.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:56.960
If you would like to take your listening skills
to the next level, maybe you watched this

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:02.530
conversation and you thought, "Yeah, I understand
Dan and Vanessa pretty well, but I can't understand

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.429
movies and TV shows.

00:34:04.429 --> 00:34:06.880
I can understand them, but I can't understand
other people."

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.149
Well, I have some good news.

00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:17.619
I would like to invite you to join us in our
course, the 30 Day English Listening Challenge.

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:25.359
On December 22nd, we are going to be opening
the Pack 5 of the Listening Challenge, which

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:29.099
means that we've done this for five years
in a row.

00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:30.099
Amazing.

00:34:30.099 --> 00:34:33.970
At the end of every year, we open the Listening
Challenge, a new version of the Listening

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:35.409
Challenge.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:41.379
And that means that in the month of January,
I will give you a new listening lesson every

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.379
day.

00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:47.020
And that will challenge your listening skills
and help you to build your knowledge.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.320
So I hope that you'll be able to join us.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.769
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:34:50.769 --> 00:34:54.730
Let us know in the comments some answers to
these questions so that we can learn more

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.249
about each other and get to know you.

00:34:56.249 --> 00:34:57.249
Dan: Yes.

00:34:57.249 --> 00:34:59.050
Let us know the most embarrassing moments
of your life.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:00.190
Vanessa: Yes.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.359
Please let us know on the internet, in the
comment section.

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:04.410
That will be great.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:08.190
Well, thank you so much for learning English
with us and we'll see you again next Friday

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.059
for a new lesson here on my YouTube channel.

00:35:11.059 --> 00:35:12.059
Bye.

00:35:12.059 --> 00:35:13.520
Dan: Bye.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520
Okay.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.460
The next question is your houch, your houch.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.799
Dang it.

00:35:18.799 --> 00:35:20.140
All right.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.150
I'm not moving.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.799
Vanessa: So, on that note-
Dan: I wasn't ready.

00:35:25.799 --> 00:35:27.630
Wait, I'm not still not ready.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:28.630
Okay.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.630
I'm ready now.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.390
It is 20% (alcohol), you know?

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:36.599
Vanessa: That was a lot.

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:39.750
You’re like, “And then we all get on a
dragon and fly away?!

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.020
I was not expecting that.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.920
Dan: I know.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.930
Well, I said everybody was kissing me, so
I thought I should be absurd at the end.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.279
Hide your puppies.

00:35:51.279 --> 00:35:52.279
Vanessa: What?

00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:53.279
My puppies?

00:35:53.279 --> 00:35:54.450
Dan: She's a nihilist.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:59.009
Vanessa: A nihilist doesn't mean you're a
murderer.

00:35:59.009 --> 00:36:00.009
Dan: Will to power.

00:36:00.009 --> 00:36:01.009
Oh, the word’s mind control.

00:36:01.009 --> 00:36:02.009
Vanessa: You want to have mind control?

00:36:02.009 --> 00:36:03.009
Dan: Oh, I'm just listening to you.

00:36:03.009 --> 00:36:04.009
Vanessa: Thank you.

00:36:04.009 --> 00:36:05.009
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:36:05.009 --> 00:36:06.009
Vanessa: All right.

00:36:06.009 --> 00:36:08.430
Let's say our next-
Dan: I'm going to move on to yours.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:14.650
Vanessa: Hey, that's mine.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.230
Dan: You drink too slow.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:21.489
Vanessa: No, I'm also talking and trying to
organize a video at the same time.

00:36:21.489 --> 00:36:25.809
Dan: I save all my sips for in between.

00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:26.809
It's so easy.

00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:27.809
It's my wife.

00:36:27.809 --> 00:36:29.960
Vanessa: Oh, I wasn't going to say you.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.420
Dan: I was going to say my precious couch.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.420
Vanessa: This wine.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:39.359
Dan: This Christmas tree, this table that
I found at a flea market.

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:44.309
I am so, I love you.

00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:45.309
Grateful.

00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:51.989
Vanessa: The next step is to download my free
