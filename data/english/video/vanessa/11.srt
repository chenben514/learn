Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.690
Be careful what you say, let's talk about
it.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.910
When you have conversations with people from
other cultures, it's really important to be

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.180
respectful of that person's culture.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.730
Of course, when we're talking with people
from our own culture, we should be respectful

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.740
too, but it's a little bit more complicated
when we're talking with people from different

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.370
backgrounds because maybe you don't know which
topics are acceptable to talk about or which

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.480
topics are taboo.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.129
Taboo means that if you talk about that topic
in the wrong context, people will feel really

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.440
uncomfortable.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.190
It's inappropriate, it's just not polite.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.809
Today I'd like to help you learn 10 questions
that you absolutely should not ask in American

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:51.809
culture.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.510
These topics might be okay if you're talking
with someone who you're really, really close

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.350
to, but that's not really the situation that
we're talking about here.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.680
For this lesson, we're going to imagine three
situations.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.659
Number one, you run across someone that you
know at the grocery store, don't ask these

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.920
questions, or you are talking with a coworker
in the office, don't ask these questions,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.980
or maybe you're going out for coffee with
a new friend or a coworker or someone you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.259
don't know that well, don't ask these questions.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.140
Let's go to our first topic and question,
topic number one is politics.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.090
The main questions that you should not ask
are, "Who are you voting for?"

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.260
Or, "Who did you vote for?"

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.159
This just depends when the election was, if
it was in the past or if it's going to be

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.270
in the future.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.070
Even though this year is a presidential election
year in the US and if you turn on the news

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.840
you'll see so much information about this,
we don't really talk about our personal voting

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.420
choices, unless it's with really, really,
really close friends.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.479
On the other hand, Americans love bumper stickers
and yard signs.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.369
So you might see on the back of someone's
car, Biden, or on the back of someone's car,

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.030
Trump, or a sign in someone's yard that says
something similar about who they're voting

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.030
for.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.270
But even if someone has a bumper sticker or
a sign in their yard, they probably don't

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.330
want to debate you about who you should vote
for or who they're voting for.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.860
Usually, this is still considered an inappropriate
topic to ask about.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.080
Topic number two, family.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.420
Are you married?

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.500
Why not?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.050
Do you have kids?

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.080
Why not?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.490
Are you pregnant?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.040
These topics are considered personal, especially
if it's somebody who you've just met.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.150
I know that these types of family questions
are considered no problem in other cultures,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.650
but in the US these are personal and sensitive.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.370
Imagine this situation, someone really wants
to have kids and they've been trying to have

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.560
kids and they can't, or they had a miscarriage,
which means that they were pregnant and then

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.599
the baby died.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.980
This is a really sensitive situation and if
you casually ask them, "Oh, why don't you

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.840
have kids?" or, "When are you going to have
kids?" this really touches something inside

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.230
of them that's hard to talk about.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.820
Unless you are a really, really close friend,
I recommend not asking, "Are you married?

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.820
Why not?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.950
Do you have kids?

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.850
Why not?"

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.210
Just as a little notice, especially as someone
who recently had a baby a couple months ago,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.340
never, never, never ask a woman if she is
pregnant.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.650
Do you know what this means?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.060
This means your tummy is visibly big.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.470
Well, they could be pregnant, but what if
they're not?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.360
What if they're just a little bit overweight
or what if they just had a baby and they still

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.970
have a little tummy?

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.070
Well, this could be a really uncomfortable
situation.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.540
I saw a funny quote once that said, "Never
ask a woman if she's pregnant.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.420
Even if she is actively in labor, don't ask
her until you see the baby."

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.470
Maybe this is a little bit of an exaggeration,
but if you ask someone are you pregnant, you'd

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.340
better be 100% sure that they are pregnant.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.600
It's a little bit safer to let them bring
up this topic anyway.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.620
Maybe if you're having a conversation and
you see that they're probably pregnant, wait

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.350
until they say, "Oh yeah, I've been feeling
really tired lately," or, "I'm feeling the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.440
baby's kicks," okay, now it's a safe topic.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.460
Our next taboo topic is sexuality.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.010
If a man mentions something about his boyfriend
or a woman mentions something about her girlfriend,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.840
do not ask, "Oh, are you gay?"

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.580
This is the 21st century, it is not shocking,
or it should not be shocking, when someone

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.580
is gay.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.790
Just a little quick note.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.810
If a man or woman says my partner talking
about the person who they live with, this

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.240
doesn't always mean that it's a same-sex partner.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.770
It might mean this, but it could just mean
that they are in a committed long-term relationship.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.340
Sometimes if you are living with someone and
you are committed to them, you don't want

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.270
to call them just your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.410
In this way, it's a little bit casual, it's
not so serious.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.910
If you are in a same-sex relationship, or
if you are not and you just aren't married,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.210
well, you could call them my partner.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.710
If you happen to be talking with someone and
they say, "Oh yeah, I need to call my partner

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.630
and ask them about this," it doesn't mean
necessarily that it's a same-sex partner.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.800
It might mean that it might not.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.470
But in any situation, it's not polite to say,
"Oh, are you gay?"

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.300
Just take it in stride.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.790
Our next taboo topic is religion.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:59.520
I don't recommend asking, "Do you go to church?"
or saying, "Don't do this, it's a sin."

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.880
Even though the US has a reputation for being
potentially more religious than some other

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.860
countries, it's still not considered acceptable
to ask someone what their religion is.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.650
Now, Americans will sometimes mention, "Oh,
after I went to church, we went to the park,"

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.220
something about going to church.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.580
It's acceptable to mention it yourself, but
not really to ask someone else about it.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.860
Where I live in the south of the US, it's
generally more a religious place, but that's

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.560
because the majority of people are Protestant
Christians, so they expect that everyone else

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.930
has the same religion, which is not quite
a realistic but that's the mindset.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.750
When my family first moved to the south of
the US, the maintenance man who was installing

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.070
our refrigerator asked my mom, "Have you found
a church yet?"

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.130
We were shocked, because in the north of the
US this is not common to talk about.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.650
It's not expected that you would go to church,
and it's especially not expected that you

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.590
would ask someone about this.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:10.730
So even if you're in the south of the US and
someone asks you, I don't recommend you asking

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.900
yourself, because it's a little bit less acceptable.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.900
Our next taboo topic is race.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.169
I don't recommend asking, "Where are you really
from?"

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:27.120
especially when someone is obviously from
the US.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.600
The US is such a diverse place, people come
from all sorts of backgrounds, all sorts of

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.320
types of heritage, even if it was their great-great
grandparents who moved to the US, a lot of

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.010
people have different, looks, different backgrounds,
different cultures, but they're still all

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.010
American.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.990
This question often gets asked to my Asian-American
friends.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:54.350
For example, I have a friend who, when I first
met her, I thought, oh, she looks Korean,

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.270
but she didn't have any type of accent.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:03.900
She seemed completely like someone from the
US, so I didn't really ask her, "Are you Korean?"

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.889
That would have been a little bit rude and
presumptive.

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:10.180
Instead, I just didn't say anything.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.350
I didn't even ask her, "What's your heritage?"

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:19.560
This is a slightly more polite question, but
only when you're talking about your family's

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.900
background already.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.250
Instead of asking her this, I just thought
it doesn't matter, why would I need to ask

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.250
this?

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.159
One day when I was at her house, I saw a little
picture or painting on the wall with some

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.899
Korean writing and I said, "Oh, cool.

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:36.669
I used to live in Korea.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.669
Have you been there?

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.469
I saw that picture in your kitchen with some
Korean writing."

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:45.290
She said, "Oh, my mom was adopted from Korea."

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.569
This type of situation is extremely common
in the US.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:53.680
My friend has pretty much no cultural connection
to Korea.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.600
Her mom has almost no cultural connection
to Korea, too, except that she lived there

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.170
when she was very, very young before she was
adopted.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.680
If I had asked my friend, "Hey, where are
you really from?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.290
Are you from Korea?" she probably would have
felt like, "I don't belong here.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.290
This isn't my home," but really it is.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.420
She is American just like anybody else.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.509
This question can make people feel pretty
uncomfortable.

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:26.649
I personally recommend waiting until they
mention something, or just don't worry about

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.649
it.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:32.100
Don't ask about it, and if they mentioned
something, cool, if they don't, go with the

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.100
flow.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.490
Our next taboo topic is money.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:41.459
I don't recommend asking, "How much money
do you make?" or how much was some kind of

00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:44.759
expensive item, maybe like a car.

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:50.149
Sometimes people will add this expression,
"If you don't mind me asking," before asking

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:51.149
about money.

00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:56.439
I did this a couple of weeks ago when my neighbor
hired a babysitter and I was curious how much

00:09:56.439 --> 00:10:01.749
she charged or how much the babysitter charged
to watch her kids.

00:10:01.749 --> 00:10:07.009
I didn't really want to directly ask her,
"Hey, how much money did you give the babysitter?"

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:13.639
so I asked, "If you don't mind me asking,
can I ask how much she charged?"

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:16.019
This is very indirect.

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:22.089
I'm asking her about the purchase of potentially
an expensive thing, some babysitting services,

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:25.529
but I'm asking her in an indirect way.

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:31.110
When I hired that babysitter, I could say,
"Well, how much do you charge?"

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.179
This is very direct.

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:34.749
It's fine, this is a business transaction.

00:10:34.749 --> 00:10:39.300
But when it's someone else who's making that
purchase, it's better to use this expression,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.680
or just not ask at all.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.540
We never really ask how much money do you
make talking directly about personal income.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.830
Yeah, it's not really a popular topic or a
comfortable topic.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.949
Our final taboo topic is appearance.

00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:58.509
I don't recommend asking, "Are you feeling
tired today?

00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:59.899
Oh, you look tired.

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.800
Are you feeling okay?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.060
Did you lose weight?

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.110
Did you gain weight?"

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.329
Not acceptable.

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:10.800
If you're really concerned about someone,
maybe one of your coworkers is looking a lot

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.439
more tired than usual or maybe you realize
that they really lost a lot of weight and

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:20.630
you're seriously concerned about them, we
don't talk about this in just casual passing

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.630
conversation.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.019
Instead, pull them aside or talk with them
privately.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:30.700
With a lot of care in your heart, you can
ask them, "Hey, I'm a little worried about

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.700
you.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.999
You look a lot more tired than usual the last
couple of days.

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:35.999
What's going on.

00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:37.209
Are you okay?"

00:11:37.209 --> 00:11:40.279
Did you notice the tone of my voice is very
serious.

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:45.261
This is not casual conversation, you're not
just asking because you care, instead, you

00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:49.189
are very serious and you are telling them
personally.

00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:53.339
Make sure that if you ask these questions,
it is in the correct context with someone

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:56.999
who you really care about, not just in passing.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:58.480
A little special note.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:04.730
Talking about appearance, especially for men
directing comments towards women, I don't

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.860
recommend saying something so direct as, "Wow,
you look really beautiful."

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.119
This is usually considered flirting.

00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:17.050
If you are flirting with them and you went
to ask them out on a date, okay, go ahead,

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.529
but if you're just in the office and you notice,
"Oh, wow.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:29.330
You look great today," be careful being so
enthusiastic about it, "Wow, you look so beautiful

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.330
today."

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:36.050
Instead, it's considered more polite to compliment
maybe their haircut or their clothes.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.939
"Oh, did you get a new haircut?

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:38.939
It looks great."

00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:39.939
Wonderful.

00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:41.369
Or, "Oh, that's a nice shirt.

00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:42.920
I love those colors."

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.279
This is more indirect.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:49.410
If you want to compliment someone's appearance,
especially for a man directed towards a woman,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.459
and you don't want them to feel uncomfortable
because you're just coworkers or you're just

00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:58.329
friends and you're not trying to be romantic
towards them, well, you can compliment them

00:12:58.329 --> 00:13:02.569
indirectly, their hair, their clothes, something
like this.

00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:04.179
Actually, that was not the last topic.

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:08.440
I got a little distracted because I heard
my baby crying, so he's going to join me for

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.670
this last taboo topic.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.699
We're going to end on a light note, death.

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:20.629
I do not recommend asking, "Do you think he's
going to die soon?" or, "I think he's going

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:22.439
to die soon."

00:13:22.439 --> 00:13:24.739
This is too direct, too rude.

00:13:24.739 --> 00:13:32.929
Yes, death is an essential part of being alive,
being a human being, a being, but we do not

00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:34.899
say it in such direct terms.

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:39.929
Instead, if you want to talk about death,
you can use a more indirect expression to

00:13:39.929 --> 00:13:41.180
pass away.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.429
You might say, "Sorry I was gone from work
last week.

00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:49.290
My grandmother passed away and I had to travel
to California for the funeral."

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:54.940
In this situation, you're saying pass away,
much more polite to say.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.499
If someone says this to you, how can you react
to show that you care?

00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:04.749
You can simply say, "Oh, I'm so sorry," or,
"I'm sorry for your loss."

00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:09.779
You don't need to go on and on, those two
common polite expressions are really enough.

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:11.820
You say it from your heart and you mean it.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.600
Now you might be wondering if I can't talk
about all these taboo topics, what can I talk

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600
about?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.199
Well, really the possibilities are endless.

00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:24.040
You could talk about your weekend plans, you
could talk about that time you broke your

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.389
arm when you fell out of a tree as a kid,
you could talk about how you wish you could

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:33.439
go to New York on a vacation, you could talk
about how octopuses are pretty much the smartest

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:34.819
animal in the world.

00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:36.889
The possibilities are endless.

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:41.179
If you'd like to know how to start a conversation
with anyone, I made a video about this that

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:42.850
you can check out up here.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.810
This is especially useful for starting conversations
in the US, but really you can use these for

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.389
starting conversations maybe even in your
own native language as well.

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:53.869
And now I have a question for you.

00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:57.329
I'm curious, what are some taboo topics in
your country?

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:02.639
Let me know in the comments, let us know what
your country is and what are some taboo topics.

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:07.029
This could help other people as well if they
travel to your country or if they meet people

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:08.379
who are from your country.

00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:12.699
Thanks so much for learning English with me
and with my baby.

00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:16.290

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.290

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.920
Do you want to say goodbye?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.889
Oh, you got my hair.

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:23.079
Say bye.

00:15:23.079 --> 00:15:28.899
