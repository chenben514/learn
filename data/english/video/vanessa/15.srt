00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.060
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.740
Dan: And I'm her husband, Dan.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.990
Vanessa: Today, we're going to be eating some
wonderful things.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.830
Let's get started.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.830
Are you hungry?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.340
Do you have a sweet tooth?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.220
Well, I have some good news.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
My husband Dan and I went to a local bakery
in our city, where we chose seven amazing

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220
desserts, and we want to share them with you.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.220
Dan: Yeah.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.220
I hope you're hungry.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.220
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.220
Virtually share them with you.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.440
So what I would love for you to be able to
do during this lesson is to immerse yourself

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440
in English.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.000
You're going to have a quick little visit
to the bakery, where we buy these, and then

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.850
we're going to be talking about what we taste,
what it smells like, the different textures.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.170
Just a chance for you to feel like you are
in an American home for a couple minutes,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.789
enjoying yourself, learning some new vocabulary
and phrases.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:03.530
Are you ready to get started?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:26.630
Dan: How could I not be?

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:42.030
Vanessa: Let's do it.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.950
Dan: For this lesson, we're going to actually
play a little game.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.750
We are going to compare two similar style
of pastries and decide which one we like better.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.390
We'll rate them one through 10 and we'll also
say between the two, which one we like better.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.950
Vanessa: Oh, this is my favorite kind of game.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.950
Dan: Indeed.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.950
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.950
All right.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.950
We're starting off with the two that we think
are maybe the least exciting, but still could

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.319
be really sweet and tasty.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.319
Dan: This looks pretty exciting to me.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.300
Vanessa: In front of me, I have peanut brittle.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.650
It looks kind of crunchy, kind of thick.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.650
It's got peanuts in it.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.650
Dan: This is very American.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.650
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.650
What about for you?

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.650
What do you have?

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.110
Dan: This is English toffee.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.190
It is an obviously English-style, sweet, kind
of crispy, crunchy candy.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.700
Vanessa: Caramelly kind of thing?

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.090
Dan: Caramelly.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.090
Yeah.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.870
Vanessa: All right.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.870
Well, let's try it.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.090
Which one do you want to try first?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.650
Dan: Let's try this one.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.650
Vanessa: Okay.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.650
I'll try the big piece.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.120
Dan: Traditionally, you'd eat this with your
fingers.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.810
So let's give it a shot.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.810
Very buttery.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.810
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.980
Dan: That's the first thing that comes to
my mind.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.980
Butter.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.170
Vanessa: I feel like I expected it to be chewy,
but instead, it's more crispy.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.599
So the inside, the caramel on the inside is
pretty crispy.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.170
Dan: I'd say perfectly crispy.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.239
Vanessa: Perfectly crispy.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.239
Dan: Perfectly.

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.239
Vanessa: Wow.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.300
So you're going to give this one a high ranking
probably?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.300
Dan: I don't know.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300
Let me try the other one first.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.099
Vanessa: If you had to guess what was on the
outside, what would you say?

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.440
Dan: I think pecans.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.560
Vanessa: Percans?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560
Okay.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.440
Dan: Some kind of nut is on the outside.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440
Vanessa: Pecans.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440
Maybe walnuts.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.370
Definitely chocolate.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.500
So it's kind of like a sandwich of those things
with caramel in the middle.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.500
All right.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.500
You want to try the peanut brittle?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.500
Dan: Sure.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.060
I'm going to take this huge piece.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.510
Vanessa: Okay.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.510
When we bought these at the bakery, I didn't
really want to explain, "Oh, these are-"

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.640
Dan: Oh, this one's hard.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.319
Vanessa: "-for us, but we're not going to
eat them all."

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.730
Anyway, we just bought a lot of pastries.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.260
I felt a little bit embarrassed.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.049
Dan: This one's crunchier.

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.440
Vanessa: Whoa.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.840
Dan: Whoa.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.020
I haven't had peanut brittle in a long time.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.020
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.069
Dan: That's good.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.930
Vanessa: I don't think I've ever had real,
homemade peanut brittle.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.019
I've only had the kind ... It comes in a little
candy wrapper.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.590
It's kind of cheap Halloween candy.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.440
Dan: They're pretty similar.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.159
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.580
I feel like-
Dan: This one has more of a candy taste to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.580
it.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.080
Vanessa: This makes me feel like I need to
brush my teeth immediately.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080
Dan: Yeah.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080
That's really sweet.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.720
Vanessa: Maybe we should have started with
this one last.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.000
Dan: This one's more buttery and crispy, and
this one is more crunchy, candy.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.770
Probably made with corn syrup, I imagine.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.770
Vanessa: Maybe.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.770
I don't know.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.660
This is a local bakery, so I'm sure that they're
trying to make it as nice and smooth and-

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.910
Dan: More authentic.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.580
Vanessa: Authentic as possible.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.580
Yeah.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.310
If you had to choose between the two of them
when we go back to this bakery someday, and

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.860
these were the only two pastries available
... Well, they're not pastries, but sweets

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.860
available.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.090
Dan: They're very similar to me as far as
how much I like them.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.090
Vanessa: Oh, it's different for me.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.330
Dan: I don't love love them.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.540
So I'm going to say ... You know what?

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.540
Vanessa: Let's point.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.540
Dan: Point?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.540
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.750
Point at three, two, one and point.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.750
Dan: Okay.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.750
Vanessa: All right.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.750
Three, two, one.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.750
Oh, really?

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.750
Dan: I'm going with the peanut brittle.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.750
I don't know why.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.310
The peanut flavor just smacks you in the face
and I like that.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.940
Vanessa: I think I'm not a fan of how much
it will probably stick in my teeth.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.940
Dan: Yeah.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.940
This is going to stick in your teeth, too.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.940
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.800
I mean it's going to stick in your teeth,
but it's less crunchy and I really like this

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.160
...
Dan: This one's crispier.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.229
Vanessa: Crispy on the outside.

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.930
Dan: It's close to me, but-
Vanessa: Creamy on the inside.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.860
Dan: I'm going to say seven for this one and
6.5 for that one.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.550
Vanessa: Oh my goodness.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.550
Okay.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.050
Well, I'm going to give this one a five.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.240
Dan: A five?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240
Ouch.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.630
Vanessa: It's still good.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.830
This is a spectrum of amazing desserts.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.700
This one, I would buy it again.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.759
I probably would not buy this one again.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.820
I will still eat it over the next couple days.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.449
Dan: See, I'm going for a second bite.

00:05:52.449 --> 00:06:00.550
Vanessa: But I feel like this one ...
Dan: Plus, I'm an American boy, so I've got

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.550
to like peanut brittle.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.490
Vanessa: I think it's the chocolate.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.590
The chocolate on the outside of this is just
an extra touch.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.690
I'm going to give this one a six.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.729
Dan: A six.

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:12.729
Okay.

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.310
Vanessa: A still kind of low rating, but I
know that these probably-

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.310
Dan: You're setting the standard.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.310
She's got a baseline.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.310
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.360
I know that the other desserts will probably
be better to me.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
Dan: We'll see.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360
Vanessa: All right.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
Let's go to the next pair.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360
Dan: Okay.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360
Vanessa: All right.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.080
The next pair of desserts that we're going
to taste are similar styles again.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.699
I have a chocolate pot de crème.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.699
Dan: Chocolate.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.590
Vanessa: It looks like it's completely chocolate,
some whipped cream on top.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.550
There's a blackberry and a blueberry with
a little spring of rosemary.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.550
Dan: Yes.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.539
This one is kind of similar, except it's not
chocolate.

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:44.740
It's Swedish cream.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.039
Vanessa: If you're from Sweden, let us know
if this is actually a Swedish dessert.

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.740
Dan: I've never been to Sweden and I don't
know if this is a legit Swedish thing, but

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.800
it's got this sweet cream and then it almost
looks like a yogurt and then jelly.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.800
Raspberry jelly.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.180
A raspberry and I guess another rosemary sprig.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.180
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.630
I feel like I've had this one a lot with blackberry,
but I've never seen them make it with raspberry.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.229
Maybe it's a seasonal thing.

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.229
Let's give it a try.

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:13.250
Dan: They just wanted to change the color
up.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.990
Vanessa: I think we should try this one first.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.990
Dan: Okay.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.340
Vanessa: Because I think the chocolate might
be more of an overpowering taste.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.340
Dan: It's going to be overpowering.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.340
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.461
Dan: I think we've had both of these before,
but I'll give it a shot.

00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:26.539
Vanessa: I don't know if I've had this one.

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:32.250
Dan used to work at a chocolate shop, so we
had a lot of different types of chocolate.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.849
Dan: This looks really good.

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:34.849
Vanessa: Cheers.

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:36.510
Dan: Should we cross arms?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:43.350
Vanessa: Might be a little messy.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.960
That's so amazing.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.729
Dan: This is way better than peanut brittle.

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:48.830
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.360
It's crazy because this cream down here, it
looks like it should be just yogurt, but it's

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.360
not too sweet.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.720
Well, it's very sweet, but it's not too sweet.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.720
Dan: It's pretty sweet.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.729
Vanessa: At least for my taste.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.490
The jam on top is so smooth.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.490
Dan: It's tart.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.490
Vanessa: And tart.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.490
Yeah.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.970
I think that the berryness of it is great,
too.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.680
Dan: Obviously, it's very creamy and I like
cream.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.160
What can I say?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.699
Well, I'm going to clean off my spoon and
try the chocolate.

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:17.039
Maybe I should refresh-
Dan: I don't always like fruity kind of desserts,

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:23.949
but this has just a layer of tart jelly or
jam on the top, and that really just hits

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:24.949
the spot for me.

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:25.949
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:28.910
It doesn't feel too heavy, especially if we
go to the bakery and share this.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.910
Dan: Yes.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.039
I feel like I could eat this whole thing.

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:32.039
Vanessa: It feels like a good sharable thing.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.560
Dan: I could eat the whole thing without getting
sick.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.039
Vanessa: Oh, that's a good thing.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.760
Dan: That's a big thing for me.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.320
Too much sweets makes me feel sick.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.320
We don't eat sweets that often except for
today.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.060
Usually if I go for a dessert, usually I go
for something that's chocolatey, but I've

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.230
bought this one more often than this one.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.350
So I'm curious now how this one will taste
after that.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.610
Dan: Got to clean off the spoon.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.610
Vanessa: All right.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.279
I'm going to try some-
Dan: Is that gross?

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.279
Probably.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.279
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.279
No one likes to watch other people eat stuff.

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.160
Dan: That's what we're doing in this video.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.680
Vanessa: Well, I guess the-
Dan: People don't like to watch people eat

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680
stuff.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.230
Vanessa: I mean chewing and those sounds are
always awful.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.940
Do you want to cheers?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.940
Dan: Whoa.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.950
A lot thicker.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.269
Vanessa: Yes.

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:18.690
This one feels a lot lighter.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.730
The texture is really thick.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.820
Dan: It's almost like mousse.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.180
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.500
It's even thicker than a mousse.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.790
Like between a mousse and a brownie.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.860
Dan: Both of these are really good.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.160
Vanessa: Are you cool if I eat this whole
blackberry?

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.460
Dan: Yeah, go ahead.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.760
I'll eat the blueberry.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760
Vanessa: Okay.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.260
I want to try it with the chocolate because-
Dan: Are we supposed to eat the rosemary or

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.090
is that just purely a garnish?

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.300
Vanessa: I feel like they added the berry
for looks.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:52.610
Dan: I'll try it with a little bit just ... Oh,
you know what?

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.680
It actually tastes good with it.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680
Vanessa: Oh, yeah?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680
What happened to it?

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.699
Oh, it's on here.

00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:58.600
Maybe I'll try it.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.440
Dan: It added a little something.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.440
Vanessa: Okay.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.630
Dan: I got it on my fingers.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:12.410
Vanessa: I think the berry is a stronger taste
to me than the rosemary.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.410
Dan: Yeah.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.410
The blueberry was really good with that, too.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.400
I don't know about the blackberry, but-
Vanessa: I love berries.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.830
Dan: All the little additions they had here
really made it taste a lot better.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.830
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.830
What about that raspberry?

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.830
Are we going to fight over it?

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:24.830
Dan: You can have it.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.830
Vanessa: Okay.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.830
Dan: I've got to save space.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.830
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.830
We've got a lot of desserts coming.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.320
Well, I feel like they know what they're doing
as far as the garnish.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.120
They know what will look good and they also
know what's going to give it that extra edge.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.200
Dan: Yeah.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.200
I feel like I thought this was going to be
the clear winner when I tried it, but now

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.430
I'm not so sure.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.480
They're both so good.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.290
Vanessa: Maybe I'll have to try this one again.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.329
I think that-
Dan: Got to try coffee with it.

00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:58.210
Vanessa: I think I could never order this
one by myself because it's too rich.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.500
Dan: I've got to try this one again.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.959
Vanessa: It's rich in a good way, but it's
too rich for at least me to handle the whole

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.110
cup by myself.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.350
Dan: Daggum.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.370
I like both of these.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.140
Vanessa: I could probably handle that by myself
if I was forced to.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.140
Yeah.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.000
I need a sip of my tea.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.570
Dan: Oh, they're both so good.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.570
Okay.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.720
I'm going to say-
Vanessa: All right.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.040
We've got to point.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.040
Three, two, one.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.260
Vanessa: I still pointed to the opposite one.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.260
So why do you like that one the best?

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.040
Dan: Well, it was a last minute decision.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040
I don't know.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.769
Just the thick, creamy chocolate.

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:33.769
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:34.769
Dan: I don't know.

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:37.040
Just really got me on that last bite.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.040
It was really good.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.550
Also, all the garnishes on it taste really
yummy.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.990
Both of them are really good.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.620
It's a tough decision.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.980
Vanessa: If I'm going to have something thick
and chocolatey that's not cake or a cookie,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.610
I think I would rather have hot chocolate.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:53.610
Dan: Oh, yeah?

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.600
Oh, I'd take this any day over hot chocolate.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600
Vanessa: Instead of this?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600
Dan: I thought we were similar.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.520
Vanessa: Well, in this way-
Dan: Maybe we're just like opposites attract.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.880
Vanessa: You can have this one and I'll have
this one.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.880
Dan: All right.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.709
Vanessa: I feel like this one suits me better
because it feels lighter.

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:12.860
We've got a lot of desserts to come.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.110
It's a little bit lighter and-
Dan: It is a little lighter.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.930
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.450
Something about it, the fruitiness and the
creaminess is still better.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.670
If I had the option to buy one of these again,
I would definitely buy this one-

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.670
Dan: All right.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.670
We've got to rate them.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.670
Vanessa: -over that one.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.670
Oh.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.310
Dan: I'm going to say, just so I don't go
too crazy here, nine.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.310
Vanessa: Whoa.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.690
That's a little crazy.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.690
Dan: Point five.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.230
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.740
Dan: This one is a nine.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.740
There we go.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.180
Vanessa: Oh, you still like this one at a
nine?

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.180
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.030
I really like both of them a lot.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.030
Vanessa: Okay.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.260
I think I would say this one is probably an
8.5.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.910
Dan: Vanessa is actually reasonable.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.230
Vanessa: Well, I'm just waiting because the
other-

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.230
Dan: The next time I really love something,
it's actually going to be rated 11.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.700
Vanessa: Oh, you're going to go above the
scale?

00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.700
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.700
I'll just go above the scale.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.700
Vanessa: Cheating.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.940
I think the thing is we have three other desserts
that I've never tried before, and I've tried

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.940
these before.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.320
At least this one before.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.480
So I want to leave some room on the scale.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.769
I think this one, I would say-
Dan: Hey, I left room.

00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:14.769
Point five is something.

00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:15.870
Vanessa: 8.5 and maybe 7.5.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:21.120
Dan: Oh, that's an insult to this fine dessert.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.820
Vanessa: It's still better than the other
two as far as what I would like to have if

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.820
I were to go to the bakery again.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.820
Dan: Yeah.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.820
Vanessa: All right.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.820
Let's go to the next pair.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.820
Dan: All right.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.160
For the next round, we have cakes.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.000
We have a classic American cake.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.959
I don't know if it's only in America, but
this is carrot cake.

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:40.370
It doesn't really taste like carrots in my
experience.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.360
It just tastes-
Vanessa: Carrots were killed in the making

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360
of this, though.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.550
Dan: Carrots were destroyed in the making
of this, but it just tastes like a sweet cake.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.150
Vanessa: This is a chocolate fudge cake.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.810
I don't know what exactly makes it fudge except
it's really dense.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:59.040
I would just call it a chocolate cake, but
I know that this one probably has a cream

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:05.410
icing and this one most likely ... The typically
pairing for icing with carrot cake is cream

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.410
cheese icing.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.410
Dan: Cream cheese.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.850
Vanessa: So if you ever had cream cheese on
toast, it's a sweet version of that.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.280
I must be honest.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.380
For my whole life, carrot cake has been one
of my top favorite cakes.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.389
So I'm curious how this bakery will do carrot
cake.

00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:25.500
Dan: I feel like if the last round was any
predictor, I'll probably like this better.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.660
Vanessa: Oh, because it's chocolate?

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.949
Dan: Because it's chocolate and fudgy.

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:29.290
It's probably going to be pretty similar.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.290
We'll see.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.339
Vanessa: Which one should we try first?

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:34.150
Dan: Let's start with the chocolate this time.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.340
Vanessa: Okay.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.340
Sure.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.340
Let's see.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.019
Got to get some icing.

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:44.750
Dan: Got to go all the way down.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.300
This is a big cake.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.480
Vanessa: Rich.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.839
This is one slice of cake.

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:57.589
I feel like if I were served this slice of
cake at a birthday party, there is no way

00:14:57.589 --> 00:15:02.899
I would ever finish that, but half of this,
I could probably finish that if it was a special

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:03.899
occasion.

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:04.970
Dan: It's pretty good.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.100
Vanessa: Pretty good?

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.130
Only pretty good?

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.130
Dan: Yeah.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.130
I like the cream better.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.699
Vanessa: Oh, all right.

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:12.370
Dan: That's just me.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.370
Let me try again.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.260
Vanessa: I'm going to try just the icing because
I'm curious.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.329
It's very dense icing.

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:19.459
It's not fluffy.

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:21.230
It tastes almost like-
Dan: It's so dense.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.230
Yeah.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.230
Vanessa: -a brownie has been spread.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.230
Maybe that's the fudge part.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.230
Dan: Well, yeah.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.230
It's like fudge.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.230
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.800
Dan: That's the fudge part on the top.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.810
Vanessa: That's really rich and sweet.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.500
Dan: That would definitely make feel sick
after eating it.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.500
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.140
It tastes almost like dark chocolate.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.269
It's really sweet, but it doesn't taste milky.

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:42.269
All right.

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:43.529
Let's try this one.

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:46.620
I've got to prepare my palate.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.170
Dan: I know.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.170
Yeah.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.230
Vanessa: All right.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.779
Tea and coffee.

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:55.790
This one looks like it also has some nuts
on the back.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.480
So we should add in those little garnishes.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.230
Dan: This one is crumblier.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.140
Vanessa: We're using our child's-
Dan: Sh.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.140
These are dessert forks.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.220
Vanessa: Yes.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.240
We have dessert forks because we're fancy.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.449
No, these are not dessert forks.

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:11.070
We are not fancy.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.329
These are our toddler's forks, but we thought
they would be cute and small for desserts.

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:16.329
All right.

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:17.329
You've got to try some icing.

00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:18.329
Dan: Whoa.

00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:19.329
I tasted ginger.

00:16:19.329 --> 00:16:20.329
Vanessa: Really?

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:23.290
Dan: Pretty sure there's ginger in carrot
cake.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.769
Vanessa: That's amazing.

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:31.269
It has so many different flavors that hit
you.

00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:36.690
This cream cheese icing, not too sweet, not
too overpowering.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.290
I can tell you love it.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.579
Dan: It's just okay.

00:16:39.579 --> 00:16:43.790
It's fine, but ...
Vanessa: I feel like the cake part of it ... I'm

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.709
going to try just the cake part without the
icing.

00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:48.709
The cake part.

00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:52.370
Oh, there's some raisins and maybe dates.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:17:01.040
Dan: It's reminiscent of a Christmas fruitcake,
which has a bad reputation for being nasty,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.410
but that's usually a really thick and wrapped
in a bag.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:10.299
Vanessa: It's been sitting in the fridge for
like three months or something.

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:13.530
Dan: This has a very similar flavor, though,
but just better textures.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.530
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.089
I don't specifically taste carrot, but I don't
... It's hard to put your finger on exactly

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.500
what the taste is except for-
Dan: Cinnamon.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.510
Vanessa: Nuts, cinnamon.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.040
Dan: Do I see coconut?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.641
Vanessa: I think there is coconut flakes in
it.

00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:27.290
Dan: This is a lot of stuff in there.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.400
Vanessa: It's a lot of different flavors.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.550
I like the dried fruit in it.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.460
The raisins or maybe some kind of dried plums,
maybe.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:41.480
Dan: To me, it tastes like a cinnamon roll
with fruit in it and a sprinkle of disappointment.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.090
Vanessa: A sprinkle of disappointment?

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.260
Dan: It's just not as good as-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.750
So I can imagine which one you think is going
to be the winner.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.750
Are you ready?

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.750
Dan: I don't know.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.750
Vanessa: Let's rank it first.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.590
Dan: Last time, we pointed at it.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.880
The one we liked better.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880
Vanessa: Oh, first?

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.880
Before we gave a number?

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880
Dan: Yeah.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.890
Vanessa: Are you sure?

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.040
Dan: I'm sure.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040
Vanessa: Okay.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040
Three, two, one.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.290
I knew you'd choose that one.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.643
Dan: How do you like this one better?

00:18:05.643 --> 00:18:06.900
Vanessa: This is too rich for me.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.900
I think-
Dan: Oh, come on.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.780
Vanessa: The complex tastes in this, you can't
beat that for me.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.871
There's just so much going on with the different
textures and the dried fruit in it and the

00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:18.230
nuts and the icing.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.250
It's still really rich.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.293
I would rather share this than get it myself.

00:18:20.293 --> 00:18:21.919
Dan: It is less rich than that.

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:22.919
That's for sure.

00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:23.919
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:26.840
Dan: This fudge frosting is very rich.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.100
I probably wouldn't order this by myself.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.530
For sure, I couldn't finish that.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.980
I prefer the pot de crème.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.870
Vanessa: I do too over this.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.730
I think if I were to order this or if I could
change something about it, it would be that

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.540
the icing would be more fluffy.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.540
Dan: So not fudge.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.740
Vanessa: Kind of like a mousse type icing
instead of fudge because to me, that makes

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.669
the cake-
Dan: So just chocolate cake.

00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:50.830
Vanessa: Just chocolate cake.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.990
I think it overpowers the cake.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.560
The cake is good, but the fudge is too strong.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.560
Dan: Yeah.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.870
It didn't taste strong to me, though.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.870
Vanessa: Oh, yeah?

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:59.870
Dan: Just the texture and the richness.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.740
It had an extra richness about it.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.490
Vanessa: What's your number score?

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.370
Dan: Yeah.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:14.120
For the chocolate cake, I'm going to give
that a 7.5.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.240
I actually don't like the cake that much.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.740
What did I give the toffee?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.850
Did I give that one an eight?

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.850
Vanessa: I don't remember.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.850
We'll have to go back and see.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.910
Dan: If I gave the peanut brittle an eight
... See, now I have to revise everything.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.559
Then that's definitely an eight.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.460
It's got to be at least tied with the peanut
brittle.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.460
Vanessa: Okay.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.110
So this is in your mind the same as the peanut
brittle.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.530
Dan: It's better than ... 8.5.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.530
Vanessa: Wow.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.100
Dan: It's better than the peanut brittle.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.100
Vanessa: Okay.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.100
What about this one?

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.100
Dan: That's like a 6.5.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.100
Vanessa: Oh, really?

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.100
Dan: Yeah.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.100
Vanessa: The sprinkle of disappointment.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.100
Dan: Yeah.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.100
It's just okay.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.289
I mean I'll still eat it.

00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:49.070
I'm just not loving it.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:55.250
Vanessa: I'm going to say that this one is
... Well, at the end of this lesson, we will

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.510
rank all of them together, but I can't help
but do that now a little bit.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:06.600
I think that the Swedish cream is still better
than this, and I gave the Swedish cream 8.5.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.400
I think that this to me is still pretty high.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.799
I might say 7.5.

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:13.799
Dan: 7.5.

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:15.130
Vanessa: Maybe eight.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.130
Dan: Jeez.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.539
You're a harsh critic.

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:24.690
Vanessa: Well, it's really amazing, but we've
got to be a little tempered in our expectations.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.570
For the chocolate cake, I would say 6.5.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.030
I'm so sorry.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.980
Dan: How dare you?

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.990
Vanessa: You can have this one and I'll have
this one.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.990
Dan: We switch again.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.190
Vanessa: Well, we have one more final dessert
after this.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.130
It isn't going to be compared to anything
because nothing is really like this, at least

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.130
at the bakery.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.630
Dan: We also didn't want to get too sick.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.179
Vanessa: And eat too much, but it's a pretty
crazy, giant dessert.

00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:51.350
Are you ready to go into that one?

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.350
Dan: Let's do it.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.350
Vanessa: Let's do it.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.350
All right.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.789
For our final dessert, we have this insane
giant.

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:58.789
Just look how big that is.

00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:00.370
It's the same size as my hand.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.370
Huge.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.409
They call this mountain éclair.

00:21:02.409 --> 00:21:04.200
Dan: The mountain éclair.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.220
Vanessa: Because it is an éclair, but it
looks like a mountain.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.220
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.080
Are éclairs traditionally long?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.260
Vanessa: That's how I think of it.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.260
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.260
That's how I think of them.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.260
Like a fancy Twinkie.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.260
Vanessa: Oh.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.250
Yeah, but-
Dan: This is a very fancy Twinkie.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.280
Vanessa: Maybe it's because we live in the
mountains.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.730
They wanted to do a local play on this, like
a mountain éclair.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:29.720
Dan: This is a chocolate coating and then
a thin pastry inside filled with cream.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.720
Sweet cream.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720
Vanessa: Yes.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.850
I imagine probably a light, fluffy kind of
cream.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.380
Not a heavy, eggy kind of cream, but we'll
find out.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.610
The only way to get into the middle of this
is to destroy it.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.620
Dan: I want to take a dainty bite.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.620
Vanessa: Okay.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.620
All right.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.770
Let's just take the outside first then, I
guess.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.280
Dan: It's thicker than I expected.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.630
It's like a croissant.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.320
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:03.840
It kind of does have that layered cakiness
to it, but let's break it open.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.510
Crack it open like an egg.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.161
Dan: That chocolate on the outside is really
good.

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:12.720
Vanessa: I guess somebody normal would use
a knife for this.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.929
Dan: Somebody normal.

00:22:14.929 --> 00:22:17.150
Vanessa: Somebody normal.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.620
Oh, boy.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.090
Holy cow.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.090
Whoa.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.970
Dan: It's like custard.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.550
Vanessa: Oh, it's thicker than I thought it
would be.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.870
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:28.870
Straight up custard.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.870
Vanessa: Oh, that's really good.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.870
Dan: Yeah.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.870
That's yummy.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:32.870
Vanessa: Wow.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.800
It reminds me of the lightness of the Swedish
cream.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.860
It's not too heavy.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.830
Dan: It's even lighter?

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.309
Vanessa: Yeah, maybe.

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:43.000
It's a little fluffier, but the chocolate
on the outside.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.419
Dan: Come on, baby.

00:22:44.419 --> 00:22:47.620
Vanessa: I'm going to try it all together,
too.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.450
It's a little bit hard to get it.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.590
This is definitely not first date food.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.020
If you go on a first date with someone and
you order this, you're going to be covered

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.429
in chocolate and digging into the cream.

00:22:57.429 --> 00:23:00.840
It's not a very ...
Dan: Not to mention, you'll be very sick afterwards.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.890
Vanessa: I know.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.870
Yum.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.120
That's amazing.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.570
Dan: I really like the custard inside.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:11.570
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:12.570
I think that makes it.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.980
We've had the small version of this.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.031
It's really small, but this is a giant one.

00:23:18.031 --> 00:23:21.390
Dan: The pastry part is only okay to me.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.409
Vanessa: I think the chocolate on the outside
though is a great touch.

00:23:25.409 --> 00:23:28.450
It's lighter than the chocolate cake icing.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.170
It's not fudge, but-
Dan: Yeah.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.980
Much lighter than the fudge cake as far as
the chocolate outside.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.409
Vanessa: This is definitely a sharable dessert,
especially because they offer or they sell

00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:41.409
a small version.

00:23:41.409 --> 00:23:43.529
Dan: Who will we share this with later?

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:46.780
Vanessa: Who wants this dessert after we've
destroyed it?

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.290
Dan: A gift for you, neighbor.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.890
Vanessa: I don't know if they'd like that.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.660
So how would you-
Dan: I'm going in for another bite.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.660
Vanessa: -rate this?

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.520
Zero to 10 because-
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.630
I guess we can't compare.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.909
Vanessa: We can't compare it to the other
ones until the very end, which is coming soon.

00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:04.110
What would you give this?

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.750
Dan: You think first.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.870
I've still got to chew.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.880
Vanessa: You know what?

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.159
I think I'm going to give this a ...
Dan: Eight out of 10.

00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:17.510
Vanessa: A nine.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.870
Dan: A nine.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.870
Holy moly.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:20.870
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.789
I think the cream in the middle is just really
up my alley.

00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:26.250
Dan: That's really good.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.110
Again, the pastry part is ... I'm not feeling
it.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.110
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.120
The pastry might be a little underwhelming.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.340
Dan: It's dry.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.809
It's dry and it's not very flaky.

00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:36.830
Just crumbly.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.870
Vanessa: I think it's okay, though.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.440
Dan: Chocolate on the outside.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.890
That's kind of throwing me off a little bit.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.440
Vanessa: I wonder if we got the small one
if it would be different because it bakes

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.390
in a different way.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.200
You still have the cream, but it's not overwhelming.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.420
Dan: It's certainly not the main show isn't
the cream.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.240
So I'm going to give it a ... I'll give it
an eight.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.110
Vanessa: Oh, okay.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.350
All right.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.470
Well, let's bring back all of our pastries.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.610
Dan: I'm generous with my pastries.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.419
Vanessa: You did give them all very high scores.

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:12.179
Well, we tried to choose ones too that we
knew would be good.

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:14.790
This bakery has all amazing things.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.980
Let's bring back all the pastries and put
them side by side to see what is the ultimate

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.980
winner.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.980
Okay.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.720
Here we have all of our wonderful pastries
that we have massacred.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.880
I want to know if the next time that you walk
into this bakery, you saw they have a lot

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.020
of other pastries, but let's imagine they
only had these seven pastries or desserts.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.929
Which one would you buy instantly without
thinking?

00:25:36.929 --> 00:25:37.929
Dan: Yeah.

00:25:37.929 --> 00:25:38.940
One of the creams, for sure.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940
Either one.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.940
It depends on my mood.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.440
I'd probably be like, "Oh, I want fruit today.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.590
Oh, I really want chocolate."

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.590
Vanessa: Okay.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.590
Dan: I'd go for one of those.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.850
Vanessa: So those are the top winners for
you.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.850
Dan: For sure.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:52.940
Vanessa: Which one do you imagine you'll probably
never buy again?

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.140
This could be we could split it together,
we could share it.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.140
That's fine, too.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.529
Dan: Funnily enough, it might be the carrot
cake.

00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:58.529
Vanessa: Really?

00:25:58.529 --> 00:25:59.529
Dan: Yeah.

00:25:59.529 --> 00:26:00.570
It's not that I hated it.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.210
It's just that it's bigger than the toffees.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.590
So I feel like I could get a little piece
of toffee and get some kicks out of that,

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.991
but with this whole cake, I've got to eat
this entire giant piece of carrot cake, which

00:26:13.991 --> 00:26:15.640
I only find to be mediocre.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.640
Vanessa: Okay.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.960
Even if you were sharing it with me?

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.790
Dan: Well, if I'm sharing it with you, then
I'd do it for you, honey.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:26.340
Vanessa: But you wouldn't do it if you were
with someone who had the exact same taste

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340
as you.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340
Dan: No.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:35.560
Vanessa: I think I would immediately buy either
the Swedish cream or the toffee.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.660
Dan: Whoa.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.760
The toffee.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.730
Vanessa: Maybe a small piece of the toffee.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:45.669
Not so big because it's really rich and sweet,
but I think if I wanted a little kick of sweetness,

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:52.000
if I were just going to the bakery to get
some tea and maybe a sandwich, I would probably

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.279
get just a little bite of that if I wanted
something sweet.

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:58.230
This is much bigger.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.600
It's much heavier, so I would probably want
to share that with someone.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600
Dan: Yeah.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.980
I do think too I might get the small éclair
also because-

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.150
Vanessa: Not the big one.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.320
Dan: I'm critiquing it now.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.150
I'm being a little harsh on the pastry part,
but if I'm just going to eat it with a friend

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.169
pretty quickly, I'm probably going to not
really care about that and all I'm going to

00:27:16.169 --> 00:27:19.510
taste is this delicious custard and it's very
satisfying.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.380
Vanessa: Our poor cakes.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.559
Dan: Cakes.

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:24.110
Vanessa: They're losing out.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.309
Dan: I mean probably most people would love
the cakes, but ...

00:27:27.309 --> 00:27:28.309
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:27:28.309 --> 00:27:30.890
Dan: I also don't like big, heavy things either.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.399
Vanessa: They are heavier.

00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:33.399
Yeah.

00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:37.049
I think if it were a special occasion, like
a birthday, that's when you traditionally

00:27:37.049 --> 00:27:38.429
have cake.

00:27:38.429 --> 00:27:43.510
Maybe I would be more inclined to get a piece
of cake and then share it with whoever I'm

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.170
celebrating their birthday with.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.429
Go to the bakery together and have a piece
of cake.

00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:50.220
But then again, you've got so many other desserts.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.029
You could just as easily have this for a birthday
because why not?

00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:55.029
Dan: Yeah.

00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:58.090
Those are so satisfying to me.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.090
The creams are amazing.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.090
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.840
Now you are going to need to come to our house
and eat the rest of our massacred desserts

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.370
because there's no way-
Dan: Please finish these.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.000
Vanessa: -we're going to be able to finish
these.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.600
Dan: Even though we ate out of each plate
already.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.600
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.600
We only ate a little bit.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.600
Dan: Maybe a little unsanitary.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.280
Well, I've got another one here to help me
eat a little bit, but my stomach is very small

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280
right now.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.620
Shrinking and smashed under the baby.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:30.590
Well, in any case, thank you so much for joining
us for this fun, outside the box English lesson.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.500
Thanks for dedicating and sacrificing today.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.500
Dan: Yeah.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500
This was so rough.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.500
I had to eat pastries today.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.500
Vanessa: So hard.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.010
This just is such a hard job.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.020
Dan: I guess it was okay.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.710
Vanessa: Well, thank you so much for joining
us.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.870
Now I have a question for you: what kind of
desserts do you like?

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.800
Out of all of these desserts, which one would
you like to try?

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.920
If you ever come to the U.S., make sure that
you visit some local bakeries, so that you

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.410
can just see the different things that different
regions have to offer.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.410
Thanks so much for joining me.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.410
Dan: You're welcome.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:04.970
Vanessa: We'll see you again next Friday for
a new lesson here on my YouTube channel.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:05.970
Bye.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.370
Dan: Peace.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:14.140
Vanessa: The next pair that we're going to
... I'm so excited, I can't even say taste.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:20.110
Vanessa: The next step is to download my free
E-book, Five Steps to Becoming a Confident

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.610
English Speaker.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.679
You'll learn what you'll need to do to speak
confidently and fluently.

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:29.590

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.590

Bye.
