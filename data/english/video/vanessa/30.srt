00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.780
Hello, hello.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.530
Welcome to today's live English lesson, here
on the Speak English with Vanessa YouTube

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.530
channel.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.640
I'm Vanessa, thanks so much for taking time
out of your busy day to study English with

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.640
me.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.439
Today I have a special advanced listening
lesson for you.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.480
You're gonna be learning, first of all, how
you can understand fast native English.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.989
I know a lot of you can understand me, maybe
you've been watching my English lessons for

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.679
a long time, or maybe you just joined me.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.390
Have you ever thought why can I understand
Vanessa, but I can't understand news reporters,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.129
or TV broadcasters, or TV shows and movies?

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.170
Well here I'm speaking with you.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.040
We're not having a quick conversation chit-chat
back and forth.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.289
The style of speaking is different.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.399
Well I want to help you be able to understand
that, because that is the key to having great

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.710
friendships and communications in English
is understanding what other people are saying.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.820
Today I'm gonna help you understand, first
of all, how to understand native English speakers,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.330
especially when they are speaking quickly.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.030
Second of all, we're gonna do it, we're gonna
practice this technique together.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.611
Finally, I'm gonna help you continue to study
like this because today's lesson is just maybe

00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:26.770
twenty, maybe thirty minutes ... it's good,
but you need to continue, so I'll help you

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.840
learn at the end of this lesson how you can
continue to study with this style, and improve

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.970
your speaking so that you can understand and
speak like a native speaker.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.140
Thank you so much for everyone whose joining
me live today.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.430
I see we have friends from Brazil, Dominican
Republic, Kurdistan, Syria, Mexico, Myanmar.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.700
Thank you so much for joining me live.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.320
Let's talk about our first point.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.670
How in the world can you understand fast native
speakers?

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.480
Maybe you've heard some tips like you should
listen to English.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.810
Listen, listen, listen as much as you can.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:09.910
Well what happens if you just watch a TV show
in English 50 times?

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.950
Will you eventually understand it?

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.170
Maybe, but if you understand only 10%, after
you watch it 50 times will you understand

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.590
100%?

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.420
It seems like it's not the most effective
method to me.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.980
If you watch TV shows that you feel overwhelmed
by because it's just too fast, and there's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.780
too much going on, we need to take it back
a little bit, we need to scale down, we need

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.590
to step back and shorten the material.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.880
Something that I often recommend to my students
is if you feel overwhelmed by a big chunk

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.360
of material, take a small piece of it.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.920
We call these bite sized chunks.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.090
Bite sized chunks means small, easily accessible
pieces, and study that small piece.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.819
When you analyze a small clip from a real
conversation, you're getting the chance to

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.360
see really how native speakers talk, but in
a more accessible piece of information.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.130
Just maybe one minute, maybe even thirty seconds
of material.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.400
That's what we're gonna do today.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.120
We're gonna take a look at a short clip, it's
only thirty seconds, you're gonna study it,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.600
you're gonna listen to it, and I hope that
you'll be able to understand it by the end

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600
of this lesson.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.180
So I want you to get a pen and a paper, because
I want you to study today.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.530
This is an active lesson.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.580
Make sure you are preparing, and not just
watching me.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.860
Make sure you are actively participating.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.920
We are gonna be analyzing a short conversation
for idioms, phrasal verbs, sentence structure,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920
pronunciation.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.150
There's a lot of natural linking that happens,
a lot of reductions that happen, and maybe

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.709
some expressions that you've never heard before.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.380
We're gonna quickly study those together.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.980
The four steps we're gonna follow today are,
first of all, we're gonna listen to a fast

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.490
English conversation clip like I mentioned.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.069
Thirty seconds, twenty seconds, maybe up to
a minute.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.680
Then we're gonna listen to a slow version
of that clip.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.719
This version is not a natural speed, this
clip is much slower because I want you to

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:28.000
understand every single word.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.620
When you listen to that slow clip you will
probably realize oh, that's what they were

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.389
saying, now I understand.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.810
Hopefully you'll have a light bulb moment.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.509
This expression, a light bulb moment, means
that you suddenly realize something, you suddenly

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.509
understand.

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.199
Oh, I can understand what the fast version
is saying.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.360
When we slow it down you'll realize okay I
understand this word, and this word, and this

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.000
word, and then we'll go back to the fast version
and I hope that you'll be able to pick it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.090
up, because while you're listening to that
fast and slow version, the third step is to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.710
write down everything that you hear.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.809
Because it's a short clip we're not talking
about a full movie, we're talking about just

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:20.650
a short clip, you'll have the chance to write
down word for word what you hear.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.779
Then we'll listen to it again, and I want
you to check your writing with the original

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:26.779
transcript.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.430
This way you can see which words you missed,
which words were more difficult for you.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.039
Maybe there's a specific sound, or a specific
type of linking that's difficult for you.

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.629
When you study it and analyze these small
clips hopefully you will have a light bulb

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:43.490
moment and say aha!

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.129
I never realized that this sounds was difficult
for me, but now I know.

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.470
So you can specifically study that sound and
practice it yourself again and again.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.879
This is just helping you to become master
of your own English learning so that you can

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.229
take charge and improve.

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.960
So we'll check your writing, and then we'll
take a lot at some clips.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.619
If you enjoy this style of learning that we're
about to do, right now there is the 30 Day

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.630
English Listening Challenge that uses this
technique every day for 30 days.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.199
You can study five to ten minutes every day
for 30 days.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.110
Last year we did this twice.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.319
There was the listening challenge pack one,
listening challenge pack two, now the listening

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.080
challenge pack three is available.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.860
This will be available until the end of the
year, December 31st.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.499
If you're watching this after December 31st,
you can check out the link in the description

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.810
to see when the next listening challenge will
be open.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.039
But I hope this technique will help you in
the new year as your New Year's resolution

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.659
to improve your English.

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.520
Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna share
my screen with you.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.389
I'm going to show you the worksheet.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.819
This is what I want your paper to look like.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.740
So here we are, I'm going to quickly share
this worksheet with you ... because we're

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.479
in a live lesson sometimes it takes a moment
to switch between things.

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.479
Are you ready?

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.660
Alright, let's take a look at this worksheet.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.699
Here we have day 30 English listening challenge
three.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:20.879
This is the day 21 lesson, this is pretty
typical for all of the days.

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:26.180
You'll see on the worksheet, this is what
I want you to write down; Vanessa, Bruce,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.449
Vanessa, Bruce- Bruce is the person I'm talking
with, Vanessa, Bruce.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:35.870
Or you can write V, B, V, B, V, B. You'll
hear us have a conversation back and forth,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.339
and I want you to write that down.

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:39.659
Let's zoom in really quick so you can take
a look at that.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:44.210
I know some of you are studying on your phone,
so it's a little bit difficult to see the

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.590
small script.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.629
This is a quick summary of what you're gonna
hear.

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:54.569
In this conversation Bruce explains that it's
difficult to get a job at the hospital.

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:57.089
Can you hear his accent from Chicago?

00:07:57.089 --> 00:08:02.169
Bruce is from Chicago so you'll be exposed
to a slightly different accent than mine.

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:08.490
I want you to write down on your paper Vanessa,
Bruce, I believe it's three different times.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.550
Vanessa, Bruce, Vanessa, Bruce, Vanessa, Bruce.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.599
Then you'll hear us have a conversation.

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:17.240
Try to write down exactly what you hear.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.800
Okay we're back, so I'm gonna let you listen
to this conversation in the fast version three

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800
times.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800
Are you ready?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.150
I want you to take a deep breath.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.740
It might seem a little bit fast, or maybe
it won't seem fast.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.060
If you feel like you can understand everything
I challenge you to write down exactly what

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.709
you hear, because I've found that students
who took the 30 day listening challenge course

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:47.680
in the past, they felt like oh I can understand
this okay but when they tried to write down

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.330
everything they were surprised that there
were quite a few words that they missed.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.690
Maybe these are small words, but these words
are essential for really speaking naturally,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.560
and using correct grammar.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.959
Challenge yourself to write down exactly what
you hear.

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:04.610
I'm gonna switch over my microphone so that
you only hear Bruce.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.139
You'll only just see my face, but you won't
see Bruce, you'll just hear it.

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:13.730
So you're gonna be testing your ears to see
if you can hear him accurately.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.930
Alright we're gonna listen to Bruce, and we're
gonna listen to him three times.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.639
Are you ready?

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:24.180
Alright, let's listen to him.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:30.240
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.649
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:34.649
V: Really?

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:35.649
B: Super hard to get into.

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:36.649
Yeah.

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:37.649
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:41.730
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:46.690
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.100
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.100
V: Really?

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.100
B: Super hard to get into.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.100
Yeah.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.100
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.120
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.010
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.420
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.420
V: Really?

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.420
B: Super hard to get into.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.420
Yeah.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.420
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.300
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:22.240
Alright, that was the fast version three different
times.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.029
You already knew that Bruce worked at the
hospital.

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:28.339
He's talking about how difficult it is to
get into the hospital.

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:32.820
Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna listen
to the slow version three times.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.170
This is not Bruce's voice, this is my voice
with my husband Dan's voice.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.250
So hopefully this is a voice you might be
familiar with, or a voice that might be easier

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.949
for you to understand.

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:49.260
The purpose of this slow version is for you
to catch each of the little words and then

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.839
we'll go back to the fast version.

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:56.900
So take your notebook, take your pen, and
try to write down everything that you hear.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.839
You can try to write it down in the comments.

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.130
You can try to write it down in your notebook.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.949
This is a good test exercise.

00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:09.529
Alright, let's listen to the slow version
three times.

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:11.959
Are you ready?

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:16.920
Alright, just a moment I've gotta switch over
my microphone.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.470
Okay.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.590
Let's get started.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:28.500
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.820
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.890
V: Really?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.610
B: Super hard to get into.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.610
Yeah.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.300
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:48.399
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:53.560
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.890
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.970
V: Really?

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.670
B: Super hard to get into.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:03.670
Yeah.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.360
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.459
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:12:13.459 --> 00:12:18.620
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:23.949
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:25.019
V: Really?

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:27.730
B: Super hard to get into.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.730
Yeah.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.420
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:40.889
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:12:40.889 --> 00:12:46.170
Alright, how did you do?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.720
Was it easier to understand that slow version?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.720
Probably.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.920
I wanna ask you a quick question.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.720
How many years had Bruce been trying to apply
to work at the hospital?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.230
Did you hear that number that he said?

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.910
And what was the specific phrase that he used
about the hospital?

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:14.790
It is one of the largest ... what did he say
there?

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.380
Did you catch every word he said?

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.660
What I'd like to do now, if you would like
to finish writing down what he said go ahead.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:29.490
I'd like to show you the transcript so you
can see word for word everything that he said.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.290
Hopefully it will help you to pick out the
words that were the most difficult for you.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.670
Alright let's go on to the transcript.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:42.509
I'm gonna share my screen with you one more
time.

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:45.520
Alright, here you can see the transcript.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.550
We're gonna zoom in.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.709
Day 21, Hospital.

00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:57.180
You can see Vanessa, Bruce, Vanessa, Bruce,
Vanessa, Bruce.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.990
This probably looks familiar from the worksheet
I showed you a moment ago, and maybe you wrote

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.629
that in your notebook.

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:05.810
We have word for word what we said.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:11.170
I said, "How did you decide to work at the
hospital?"

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.379
Notice the pronunciation of this word hospital.

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:21.259
In American English this T changes to a D.
I want you to say that correctly, hospital.

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:22.259
Hospital.

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:25.199
Repeat with me, hospital.

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:31.029
Then Bruce said, "I'd been applying at the
hospital for three years."

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:34.790
A lot of you got that number correct, three
years, but I'm curious.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.370
How many of you got this correct?

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.460
I'd.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.560
I'd.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.089
What does that D stand for?

00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:51.149
That D stands for had, I had been applying
at the hospital for three years.

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:56.589
Here he is using that past perfect tense,
I had been applying, and the reason why he

00:14:56.589 --> 00:15:01.570
uses the past perfect is because in the past
it was a continual action.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.889
It happened a lot in the past, but now something
has changed.

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:11.819
He is not applying anymore, and I can understand
that he's not applying anymore because he

00:15:11.819 --> 00:15:14.470
used I had been applying.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.149
That means that he either stopped applying
or he got a job there.

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:20.610
Then I continued and said, "Really?"

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.749
I'm surprised because three years is a long
time to apply for a job.

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:27.879
He said, "Super hard to get into."

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:29.189
Did you get this phrasal verb?

00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:31.059
We'll talk about that in just a moment.

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:33.259
"Super hard to get into, yeah."

00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:37.269
Then I say, "Does everyone want to work at
the hospital?"

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:40.910
I'm trying to find a reason why, why did it
take three years?

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:47.490
And he said, "Yeah, it's one of the largest
employers in the area."

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:52.040
Here we have that wonderful phrase, employers
in the area.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.499
In the area.

00:15:53.499 --> 00:15:55.069
Did you get all of this?

00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:58.129
Maybe there were a couple of words that were
difficult for you to get.

00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:02.329
Maybe the phrasal verb, maybe the specific
verb up here.

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:08.639
Let's go on to the bottom of this page where
we talk about these three red vocabulary expressions.

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:13.300
Every day in the 30 Day English Listening
Challenge there are three different expressions

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.019
because its useful to understand the words,
but you need to know what they mean as well.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:23.649
So let's go on to the bottom of this page
and check out I had been applying, we just

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:24.720
talked about this.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.910
Why he uses the past perfect tense, and then
there's the lovely phrasal verb, get into.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.360
This mean you're accepted.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.220
I'm trying to get into Harvard.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.089
I'm trying to get into the school of my dreams.

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:40.959
I'm trying to get into the hospital because
I want to work there.

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:45.240
I couldn't get into my apartment because I
forgot my key.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.850
You can see we're entering here you're accepted.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.629
What about that final part, in the area?

00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:54.149
This is a pretty common daily expression.

00:16:54.149 --> 00:17:01.390
Instead of saying the hospital is one of the
largest employers in my city, or in Asheville,

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.050
which is the city where I live, he said in
the area.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:09.589
This is quite a general expression to just
mean this city or region, it's not very specific,

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.070
it's a general expression.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:16.270
So I hope that these three expressions help
you to gain a deeper understanding of what

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.430
he said.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:23.160
This specific transcript here is quite useful
for that.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.190
Alright, before we go on to the final step
which is re-listening to that fast version,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.340
I want to know- how did you do?

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.190
When you look at this transcript, what words
were difficult for you?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.620
Let me know in the comments.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.910
Now we're gonna listen to the fast version
again three times, and we're gonna look at

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.120
the transcript at the same time.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.500
So that you can see which words maybe were
difficult for you.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.630
You can see exactly as he's speaking.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.820
This is the technique I recommend using in
the 30 days English listening challenge.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:02.380
Test yourself first, listen to the fast, then
the slow, then write it down and then go back

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.730
and listen to that fast version again.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:10.810
See, oh I can understand more, I can really
see what he's saying.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.620
Alright, let's listen to that fast version.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:19.540
I'm gonna show you the transcript and you'll
be able to see every single word as he's speaking.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.380
Let me share my screen one more time as we
listen to this audio.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:29.690
I'm going to open the audio for you ... this
original audio.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.090
Alright.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:40.340
Okay, I'm gonna switch over ... my screen
so you can see that as well.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:46.460
Alright, let's listen.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:54.770
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.190
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.190
V: Really?

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.190
B: Super hard to get into.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.190
Yeah.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.190
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.350
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:09.380
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.790
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.790
V: Really?

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.790
B: Super hard to get into.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.790
Yeah.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.790
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.930
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.950
V: How did you decide to work at the hospital?

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.360
B: I’d been applying at the hospital for,
like, three years.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.360
V: Really?

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360
B: Super hard to get into.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360
Yeah.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360
V: Does, like, everyone want to work at the
hospital?

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.190
B: Yeah, it's one of the largest employers
in the area.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.860
Oh, sorry about that.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.050
I didn't turn my microphone over.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.670
I want to know how did you do?

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:49.250
I hope that this will be able to test your
listening skills, but also launch you into

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:55.770
the real world because these listening skills
are great for having natural conversations,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:01.550
having a business meeting, traveling to New
York when you want to go to the US.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.510
But when you have those conversations you
can't say, hey stop I need to look at the

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.900
transcript, because there's not a transcript
when you're having a real conversation.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:17.120
So I hope this practice time will launch you
into understanding better in those real situations,

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.831
especially if you study this every single
day for 30 days in the 30 Day English Listening

00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:23.831
Challenge.

00:20:23.831 --> 00:20:26.520
You'll really be able to improve those skills.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.070
What I'd like to tell you now, is we've already
talked about how to understand, analyzing

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:37.280
those small clips, we've practiced this together
with Bruce's clip about the hospital, and

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.620
now finally how can you continue this?

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:51.440
Well I have some good news, today December
21st, 2018 until December 31st, 2018, until

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.740
the end of the year, the 30 Day Listening
Challenge pack three is available.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:05.580
So you can really practice listening every
single day and test your listening skills,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.250
but it's only gonna take five to ten minutes.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.610
I know it's difficult to do something every
single day, so I wanted to make these lessons

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:19.620
accessible, bite sized chunks, ones that you
can say oh I woke up a little bit early today

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.810
before breakfast, my family's not awake yet,
I'm gonna study it.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.870
Or, oh I need to go to bed, but I'm gonna
study this lesson real quick.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.690
These lessons are real fast, five to ten minutes.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.190
You saw the audio clip is not very long, so
you can study it again and again in five to

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.190
ten minutes.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.460
Your listening will improve every day.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:44.860
So what I'd like to share with you is on my
screen, I'm gonna share the inside, sneak

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:54.710
preview into the course so that you can see
really what each day inside the course is

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.710
gonna look like.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.830
Okay, I'm gonna share my screen again.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:08.500
Okay, this is inside the 30 Day English Listening
Challenge pack 3.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.090
It is zero percent complete at the moment
because the course hasn't started yet.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.590
You can see here all of these days.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:23.370
Day one, day two, day three, all the way down
here, day 21 is hospital, that's what we studied,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:28.910
and there are 30 days all the way down.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:33.620
Let's click to the start here, because if
you join today you'll immediately gain access

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.200
to the day zero material.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200
Let's open here.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.580
Here you're gonna find the course guide.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.380
This is how to use the material.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:48.530
When you're not studying in a classroom you
need some guidance as to how to use the material

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:53.611
because there's not a teacher present in your
house telling you do this, now do this, now

00:22:53.611 --> 00:22:54.611
do this.

00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:59.090
So this guide is my recommended study guide
about how to follow the lessons.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.460
Really this is exactly what we did today.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.520
You're listening to the original clip, you're
listening to the slow version, you're writing

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.280
it down, you're comparing it to the transcript.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.600
Great, this is gonna take you step by step.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.600
The next thing you'll find on this page is
a calendar.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.761
Each time in the listening challenge I've
made this calendar so that each day when you

00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:22.280
finish you can check, check, check.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:27.090
You can check off each day, and a lot of students
who've completed the challenge said that this

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.390
was a small motivation to help them see how
many days they finished.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.980
Oh wow, I finished 15 days already, I can
keep going.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:41.160
Or it was just a motivation to say oh I didn't
check off the next day, I need to continue.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.370
So I hope that this calendar will just motivate
you a little bit because when you complete

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.250
it you can send me an email and get a certificate
of completion.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.621
This is an unofficial certificate, but it's
my way to thank you for your hard work, and

00:23:55.621 --> 00:23:57.830
also for finishing all of this.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.920
Hopefully it will help you to see that you
have certainly improved.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.750
Let's go over to the page.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:11.390
If you click the link in the description of
this YouTube video you'll go to this page.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:17.270
This page is where you can join the 30 Day
English Listening Challenge.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:23.760
Here you can see there's ten days, ten hours,
32 minutes, 26, 25, 24 seconds, 23 seconds

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.450
to join the pack three version of the Listening
Challenge.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:35.200
You can check out some more information about
it, including some other sample lessons, some

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:43.040
sample information, so that you can go over
that again, and a bunch of frequently asked

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.140
questions.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.140
How can you download them?

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.900
Yes you can download every lesson.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.900
What's the price?

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.650
The price is $30 if you join before the end
of the new year.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:59.480
Just one one-time payment, one price, $30
if you join before the new year it's $30.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.210
The next time that the course opens it's gonna
be more expensive, so this is the special

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:09.420
early bird entrance into the pack three because
it's new.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:16.030
The first lesson will begin on January 1st,
so on January 1st you'll begin the day one

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:22.820
lesson, then day two on January 2nd, day three
on January 3rd, and so on.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:28.800
If you have any questions about this material,
I'll be answering them through email, in the

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:35.491
YouTube comments, and also next week I'll
be doing a quick live lesson again, maybe

00:25:35.491 --> 00:25:40.750
about ten or fifteen minutes answering any
of your questions about how to use this material,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.910
and also how you can participate.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.860
Because every day during the month of January
you can ask me questions.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.520
The comment section below each lesson is quite
active.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.440
I respond to almost every single question,
every single comment, so that I can share

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.200
it with you and give you some feedback.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.670
That's one of the benefits of having a teacher
is having some feedback.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:07.130
To let you know quickly, the material in the
listening challenge, even though it is only

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.370
for 30 days, you'll have access to it forever.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:17.480
So if you want to go back, maybe for you day
seven is challenging.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.100
Well you can go back at the end of the course
and study day seven 50 times, because you'll

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.760
have access to this course for as long as
it's available.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.890
You'll be able to go back and study it again,
and again, and again, and that's something

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.260
that's useful for the calendar.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.620
You can circle days that are most difficult
for you, because all of these are natural

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:41.080
conversations with different native speakers,
do you'll be exposed to different styles of

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.960
speaking, different speeds, different accents.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.190
These are all American English, but there's
a lot of different accents within the US,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.760
so you'll be able to study those.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.700
Maybe one is more difficult than another,
so you'll circle that one on the calendar,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.540
and go back, and study it later.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.980
If you would like to join me, click the link
in the description or at the end of this video.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.840
I hope that you'll be able to improve your
English over the next 30 days.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:10.890
This is the key to studying English really
consistently, every single day.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.110
Thank you so much for joining me today for
this live lesson.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.980
I hope that you learned a lot with the sample
we did in the middle of this lesson with Bruce.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.930
I hope you improved your English, and feel
free to continue with me in the 30 Day English

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:28.570
Listening Challenge pack three that's open
right now, only for $30, one-time payment.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.100

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.120
