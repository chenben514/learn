00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.360
Vanessa: Hello.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.360
Hello.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.590
Welcome to today's special live English lesson
here on the Speak English with Vanessa YouTube

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.590
Channel.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.590
I'm Vanessa.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.590
Dan: I'm Dan.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.590
Vanessa: And this is my husband Dan.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.480
Today, we're going to be doing something a
little bit special.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.540
Usually we talk about specific vocabulary,
specific grammar points, but today we're going

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.580
to be having a natural conversation with some
of our top relationships, specifically romantic

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.580
relationship, tips.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.230
Dan: Ooh, we're going to talk about love today.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.230
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.390
I feel like this is a really great chance
for you because we're going to be just having

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.210
a conversation together, but as we say new
vocabulary, we're going to try to explain

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.429
it as best as we can.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:45.429
Dan: Sure.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.829
Vanessa: This is something that doesn't happen
when you're having a conversation with someone

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.499
in your office or maybe a friend from another
country.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.210
You're just having a conversation, but there's
not a chance to stop and talk about the words

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.210
that you're using.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.479
So hopefully today during our conversation,
as new vocabulary comes up, as new vocabulary

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.270
arises ... That's a great phrasal verb.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.510
It comes up.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.690
We're going to explain it as best as we can.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.340
Make sure to take some notes.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.530
Make sure to review this if you need to for
the vocabulary and also for any romantic relationship

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.040
tips that we have to offer.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
Dan: We're going to give some tips today.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.070
Although, these are just very personal tips,
right?

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.070
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.020
Dan: Every relationship is unique, right?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.020
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.590
Dan: I would say we have a very unique relationship.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.310
We're both kind of unusual people.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.020
Vanessa: So, let's start with a couple pieces
of factual information.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.311
How long have we ... This is a kind of test.

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.780
How long-
Dan: Oh, it's a test for me.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.380
Vanessa: How long have we been married?

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.480
Dan: We've been married eight years.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.880
Vanessa: Oh, he passed the test.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
Dan: Woo!

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.560
Vanessa: This year in August it will be nine
years.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.380
So, we've been married eight and a half years
or so.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.970
Dan: Which is a long time for the average
American of our age, because we're only 30.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.970
Vanessa: One.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.970
Dan: 31.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.970
Oh, we're 31.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.690
So, we've been married a little while.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.840
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.470
When did we meet each other?

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.400
Dan: We met each other the very first day
of college.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.200
Vanessa: And I was-
Dan: Which is university in other countries.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.819
Vanessa: Yes, so I was 17 years old, but I
was almost 18.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.079
The next week was my birthday, so I was pretty
much 18 years old and you were 18, too, right?

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.079
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.079
Yeah.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.650
Vanessa: So, we've known each other for quite
a long time from 18 to 31.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.239
What is that?

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.610
13 years?

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.680
A long time.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.040
A lot has happened during that time.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.959
I think knowing someone, being in a relationship
with someone for 13 years is normal for maybe

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.290
our parent's generation, but for our generation
it's something that's a little bit surprising.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.400
When people meet us, they're surprised that
we are 31 and we've been married for eight

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400
years.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.349
Dan: Yeah, and that we've only dated each
other for a really long time.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.349
Vanessa: Yes.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.799
Dan: That's not very usual, I don't think.

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.700
Vanessa: Yeah, and that we still like each
other.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.890
I think that there's a lot of-
Dan: Do we?

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.470
Vanessa: You'll find out today.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.480
Dan: We do.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.849
Vanessa: There's a lot of things that we do
in our relationship or principles that we

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.939
have that have really helped us to maintain
a healthy, strong relationship, and those

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.670
are the two words that I want to focus on
today is having a healthy relationship, not

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.400
just how to find a boyfriend.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.370
I can't give you advice on that, but ... or
find a girlfriend.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.889
But having a healthy relationship and having
a strong relationship, it means that you feel

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.180
confident in your relationship.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.599
You feel confident in yourself-
Dan: Yes.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.269
Vanessa: ... when you're part of that relationship.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.299
Dan: And it means it will last a long time.

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.340
If you want to have children, it will be a
good relationship to have children.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.760
Because really, if you're going to get married,
it's probably mostly to have children, in

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760
my personal opinion.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.279
Vanessa: So today, before we get started,
I'd like to give a couple disclaimers.

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:11.140
First of all, we have a unique situation that
we met each other when we were young.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.739
All of these are personal tips, but that's
all we can do is share from our personal lives.

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.299
We have not been married for 50 years.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.569
I know there are plenty of people who have
been together much longer than us, so take

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.750
it with a grain of salt.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.750
Dan: Yes.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.750
But, apparently it's working.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.750
Vanessa: It's working so far.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.220
I'm curious, can we talk about that first
expression?

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.440
Because this is key for all of our tips today.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440
Dan: Which one?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440
Vanessa: Take it with a grain of salt.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.730
Dan: Take it with a grain of salt.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.690
Vanessa: Take it with a grain of salt.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.690
What does that mean?

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.340
Dan: This is an expression that just means
don't take everything we say word for word

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.420
and believe everything.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.160
Vanessa: Yeah, it's just-
Dan: We think you should believe it, but it's-

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.440
Vanessa: [inaudible 00:04:50].

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.240
Dan: Basically, just remember that it's our
opinion.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.319
Vanessa: Yeah, it's just our opinion.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.720
It's just something that's worked for us.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.370
So, you can use this expression if ... It's
great if you're giving advice if you want

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.879
to be humble.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.160
Because, you're not saying ... I don't want
say, "My relationship advice is the best advice."

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160
No, no, no.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.099
I don't want say that because it's just my
personal experience.

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:22.270
So if you give someone advice, maybe you know
some things about cars and your friends asks

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.889
you, "Can you look at the tires of my car?

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.770
I think something's wrong."

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.949
You could give some advice, but then you might
say, "Well, take it with a grain of salt.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:32.970
I'm an amateur.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.680
You should just go to a mechanic."

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.740
Dan: Yes.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.139
Vanessa: So, just please take our advice with
Take it with a grain of salt.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.570
This lovely idiom.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.281
And let's start with our first tip today.

00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:43.281
Dan: Yeah, should we start with the first
one?

00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:44.281
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:45.281
Dan: Sure.

00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:46.281
Vanessa: Dan gave a couple tips.

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:47.281
I give a couple tips.

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.539
Dan: My first tip is more for the beginning
of your relationship.

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.340
So, it's not even really during your relationship
at all.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.640
This is the pregame, we might say.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.270
And that is to make sure you're a good fit
at the beginning.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.629
So, we can talk about the expression good
fit.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.620
So, it's kind of like clothes, right?

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.620
Vanessa: Yes.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.150
This shirt is a good fit for Dan.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.150
It's not too big.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.150
It's not too small.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.180
It fits his body.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.300
Dan: It's a good fit.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.300
Vanessa: Yes.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.790
Dan: But, you can use that for people in relationships,
too, right?

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.840
So, I would say Vanessa and I are a good fit.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.500
Vanessa: You can kind of imagine maybe a puzzle
piece that your personalities fit together.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.370
So if you meet someone and you think, "Oh,
this person is a wonderful match for my-"

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.669
Dan: Good fit, not feet.

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.139
Vanessa: Yeah, not your feet.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.139
Dan: Fit.

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.139
Vanessa: A fit.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.139
F-I-T.

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.260
You could say, "Oh, I'm so excited because
we've already been on three dates and we're

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.390
such a good fit for each other."

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.390
Dan: Yes.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.390
Vanessa: This is great.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.390
You complement each other.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.479
Dan: Connected to that, I would say don't
rush.

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.129
So, don't rush into a relationship.

00:06:53.129 --> 00:07:02.150
For example, for Vanessa and I, we knew each
other for six months before we even dated.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.789
After dating, we didn't live together for
four years?

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.539
Vanessa: Yes, and I've, of course, this is
a little bit unusual.

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:09.539
Dan: And we were young.

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:10.539
We were young.

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:11.539
Vanessa: Because we were so young.

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.240
Dan: But, my point is that you don't want
to rush into a relationship.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.860
So maybe this happens to a guy a lot.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.580
You see a girl and she's so beautiful and
you can't even contain yourself.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.400
You just want to go after her and talk to
her.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.210
Maybe you're not a really good fit.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.590
You're not a really good fit personality-wise.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.919
You can't hold a conversation.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.880
You don't like to go and do things together.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:43.240
Well, your relationship is going to be a lot
more fun and a lot more enjoyable if you know

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.289
at the very beginning before you live together
if you get along, if you're a good fit.

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:50.289
Vanessa: Sure.

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:55.780
The word that Dan used, one of you asked in
the chat box, is F-I-T, fit.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.469
We are a good fit for each other.

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:01.759
Then, Dan also said, "Don't rush."

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.590
R-U-S-H, R-U-S-H, rush.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.590
Dan: Don't rush.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.590
Vanessa: Yes.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.590
Dan: Yes.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:14.180
Vanessa: I think this also shows confidence
in yourself because if you rush, maybe you

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.610
make some fast decisions really quickly.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.240
Maybe it shows, "Oh, I need to do this or
else he won't like me."

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.560
Well, it's okay.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.560
Make yourself comfortable.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560
Dan: Yes.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.610
Vanessa: Make yourself comfortable in your
relationship.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.610
That's important.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.870
Dan: There's another expression we can use
for this.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.280
But sometimes this is used in medicine, but-
Vanessa: Oh, yeah?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.520
Dan: ... you'd say, "An ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure."

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.779
Vanessa: Oh, this is a lovely ... This is
a proverb, actually.

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:37.779
Dan: It's a proverb.

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:40.750
Vanessa: I think Benjamin Franklin might have
said this.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.950
So here-
Dan: I bet some Chinese person said it.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.250
Vanessa: Maybe so.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.700
Everything originated in China, right?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.700
Dan: Yeah.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.360
Vanessa: So, we could say an ounce of prevention
... So, this is a small quantity.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:56.580
Dan: Yeah, a little bit of prevention, which
means something you do before a problem.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.360
Vanessa: Helps a lot in the future.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.490
So if you're careful a little bit at the beginning,
it will help so much.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.140
We could say it will pay off.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.910
So, Dan's advice here is at the beginning
to be careful.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.910
Choose the right person.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.720
I actually watched a TED Talk recently because
I was thinking about this topic, and I had

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.770
a lot of doubts because we are not perfect.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.800
So, I thought, "Can we give any tips or advice?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.840
We're just humans.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.100
How can we share information about this?"

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.200
So, I did some ... a little bit of research,
and I found something quite interesting.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:40.360
One of the marriage experts who I was listening
to, she said usually couples seek help in

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.100
two situations.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.270
They seek help with marital counseling, this
is after you're married, you're having problems

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.930
and you talk to a therapist.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.750
In that way, it's too late.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.750
You're already married.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.750
Dan: Yes.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.500
Vanessa: Maybe you can get divorced, but that's
a big deal.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.500
Dan: Yes.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.310
Vanessa: The second situation is premarital
counseling.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.120
If you get married in an English-speaking
country, or at least in the US, this is so

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.220
common.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.730
Premarital counseling, usually you need to
have some kind of therapy with maybe a pastor

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.610
or with someone before you get married.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:18.529
But this, the lady that I was watching, she
said, "It's already almost too late because

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:22.040
you already chose the person who you're going
to marry."

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.930
So if you have some kind of prevention in
the past, if you've already thought about,

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.399
"Who is a good fit for me?

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:35.600
Are we a good fit?" you really had some good
insight into your relationship, then, okay,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.420
premarital counseling is helpful, but it's
not going to change your life because you're

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.490
already a good fit.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:45.199
Dan: The most important thing is having a
vision and principles for yourself and you

00:10:45.199 --> 00:10:49.399
look at your partner or your potential partner
and say, "Does this match?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.570
Will this be a good fit?"

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.570
Vanessa: Yes.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:11:00.360
So, I think this is a good time to say that
for us, we are still a very normal couple

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.699
in many ways.

00:11:01.699 --> 00:11:03.380
We still have difficulties.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.970
We still argue about things.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:05.970
Dan: We're not perfect.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.030
Vanessa: No, we are not perfect.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.030
Dan: Are we?

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.240
Vanessa: No.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:16.230
I think that this is something that for the
current age, when you can see things on the

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.769
internet, when you can see things on social
media, it's kind of like ... At least for

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:24.890
women, it's kind of like watching a romantic
comedy movie.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:30.899
You might see this perfect image of this wonderful
couple in the movie, but that's not reality.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:36.209
So when you see struggle in your own relationship,
you feel like, "It's the end.

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:37.230
It's so terrible."

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.589
But really, it's just real life.

00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:47.649
So, I think it's really important to not compare
your relationship with something that's not

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:52.269
realistic, like a movie or just some kind
of social media image.

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:53.269
Dan: Yes.

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:54.269
Vanessa: So, that's kind of another disclaimer.

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:56.001
Dan: But you can compare with us because we're
real.

00:11:56.001 --> 00:11:57.001
Vanessa: We're pretty real.

00:11:57.001 --> 00:11:58.001
Dan: This is real advice.

00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.600
Vanessa: But, I think what they see of our
relationship is not every day.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600
Dan: No.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600
Vanessa: So, that's what I mean.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600
Dan: We'll get into the other things.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600
Vanessa: Yes.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600
Dan: Let's move on.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600
Vanessa: Yes.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.600
Let's move on to my tip.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.360
So, Dan's tips were kind of serious.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.860
My tips are kind of light.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.860
Light.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.890
Dan: As you can tell, Vanessa's very happy.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:20.450
Vanessa: Well, I wanted to share some things
that have personally really helped me in our

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:31.269
relationship beyond the general principles,
and this is to have fun together.

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:39.160
I think that this can apply before you are
married, but also during your marriage.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.471
I know that we have some friends who have
been together for a long time, and then, even

00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:50.860
though they both like each other, they feel
like, "Eh, there's nothing special any more.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.070
Maybe we shouldn't be together."

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.720
Of course, everyone has their own situation,
but for us, it's been really helpful to have

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.040
some common activities that we really like
to do together.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.709
There's actually a bunch of studies that show
having a relationship, people who are 100

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:14.170
years old or pretty old and they've been in
a relationship for a while, something that

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:19.740
has helped them is to have fun together, because
you're not always going to be a honeymoon

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.350
couple who just met each other.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.720
You're going to be just normal people.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.100
So, what are some things-
Dan: And this don't have to be everything.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.100
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.820
Dan: You don't have to enjoy everything together,
right?

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.820
I have a hobby.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.630
I like to watch ice hockey.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.220
She will not watch a hockey game with me at
all.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.220
That's my thing.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.220
It's okay.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.009
Vanessa: I occasionally ask you about it or
occasionally ... I have enough knowledge now

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:46.940
from living with you, but it's not ... We
don't do everything together.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.280
Dan: No, but it's just some things.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.820
It's very good if you like to do some things
together.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.770
It will make your relationship more enjoyable
overall.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.720
So for example, we like to go on hikes.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.819
We'll walk up.

00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:04.339
We'll hike up a mountain together, and we'll
have a conversation, and we'll be doing something

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:05.339
together.

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:06.339
And it's really-
Vanessa: Yeah, and then it's something that

00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:07.580
later you can reflect on.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.260
"Oh, remember when we went on that hike?"

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.550
You have more in common and you can talk about
other things.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.210
Dan: Yeah, or traveling, too.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.339
Many of you who are into English probably
also like to travel.

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:26.700
So, I remember very fondly going to Europe
with my wife, because Europe is very enjoyable.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.750
There's a lot of beautiful buildings and lots
of places to go and see.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.480
So, it's a fun thing that you can do together.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.459
Vanessa: Yeah, I think that it could be something
simple, like hiking, even enjoying cooking

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.100
meals together.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.250
We like to play games.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.250
Dan: Yes.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.730
Vanessa: We like to play board games.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.730
Dan: We play board games.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.779
Vanessa: We like to play disc golf, which
is like throwing a frisbee together.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:53.279
We like to run around in the park together.

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:56.490
We like these fun things.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.589
Something that the marriage counselor who
I was watching that video about, something

00:15:00.589 --> 00:15:05.840
that she mentioned is that sometimes after
you've been with someone for a long time,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.760
your relationship tends to get more serious.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.630
Not just serious as in your going to stay
together, but serious as in your demeanor.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.500
Demeanor means your face, your attitude.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.880
Your attitude becomes really serious because
you're talking about daily life, your job.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.940
Are you doing the dishes?

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.089
Who's cooking dinner?

00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:26.120
Where's our baby?

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.389
Just factual things.

00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:28.389
Dan: Yes.

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:29.720
Vanessa: Not really fun things.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.339
So, she said it's really important to add
fun into your life instead of just those kind

00:15:36.339 --> 00:15:38.529
of, "Okay, how much money do we have?"

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:39.529
Dan: Busy details.

00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:40.529
Vanessa: "Can we do this?"

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:41.649
Yeah, those kind of serious things.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.150
It's good to insert some fun into your life.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.459
Dan: If you have time.

00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:46.459
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:46.459 --> 00:15:49.329
It could even be something small, like listening
to music together.

00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:50.329
Dan: Sure.

00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:51.399
Vanessa: Something that you can enjoy as a
couple.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:53.139
Dan: Somebody asked, "What's a board game?"

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:55.180
Or how to spell board game.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.180
B-O-A-R-D.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.180
Vanessa: Yes.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.449
Dan: Board game.

00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:01.260
It's a tabletop game, a game you play on the
table.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Vanessa: Yes.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Dan: Like cards or Monopoly.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.260
That's a perfect example.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.449
Vanessa: We don't really play Monopoly, but
there are lots of great board games.

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:11.519
Maybe we should make a video of a board game
some time.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.519
Dan: Yeah, definitely.

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:13.970
Vanessa: It could be a fun time.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.579
All right, let's go on to the next tip that
you have.

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:19.579
What's your next tip?

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:21.009
Dan: So my next tip ... Mine are all negative.

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:22.009
Vanessa: Serious tip.

00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:26.930
Dan: It is don't make excuses or place blame.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.629
Now, sometimes you're going to do these things,
so let's-

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:32.850
Vanessa: Can you explain the word blame?

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.850
Dan: Yeah.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:34.850
Vanessa: Because that's kind of a complex
word.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:42.430
Dan: So if you place blame, which is B-L-A-M-E,
that means you are saying to somebody else,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.430
"It's your fault."

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.480
Vanessa: You're pointing your finger.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.709
Dan: "You did this.

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:47.810
It's your problem.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.720
You, you, you," and not never yourself.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.760
Don't make excuses would be if you do something
wrong, if you say something bad, or you make

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.829
a mistake.

00:16:59.829 --> 00:17:07.459
If you make an excuse, you're always saying
something like, "Well, I was tired," or, "Well,

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:11.039
I was really busy and I didn't have time to
do this or that."

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:13.569
You know, this is making excuses.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:21.829
It's coming up with reasons why you were bad
or you didn't do things as good as you could.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:30.030
So if you do these things a lot, if you place
blame or you make excuses very frequently,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.850
then your relationship will get not very enjoyable.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.010
Vanessa: Yeah, we can even use the word crumble.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.820
Dan: Ooh, crumble.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.400
Vanessa: Crumble, we can imagine a cookie.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.090
When you break a cookie, it crumbles.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.750
It breaks into little pieces.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:52.360
So, we can use this figuratively to say, "Our
relationship is crumbling."

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.419
Dan: Yes, place blame.

00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:54.419
That's right.

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:55.419
Somebody wrote, "Place blame."

00:17:55.419 --> 00:17:56.419
Vanessa: Yes.

00:17:56.419 --> 00:17:57.419
Don't place blame.

00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:58.419
Dan: A lot of times, you can get into blame
games.

00:17:58.419 --> 00:18:00.659
Vanessa: Oh, this is a good idiom.

00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:01.809
Don't play the blame game.

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:07.790
Dan: A lot of times, if you blame somebody,
if you say, "This is your fault.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.010
Why did you do this?"

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.280
Maybe they'll say, "No, it's your fault,"
and you'll just go back and forth and back

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280
and forth.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280
Vanessa: This is the blame game.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.280
It's not good.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:25.159
I think that in this situation this is an
important time to have insight into yourself

00:18:25.159 --> 00:18:27.990
and insight into the other, your partner.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.520
The word insight, we can imagine, in, inside,
and sight.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.640
You're seeing into yourself.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.850
So in this situation, let's take a concrete
example.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.490
This is something that happens in our house.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.590
I'm sure it happens in your house, too.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.700
The dishes.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.730
We actually just got a dishwasher, so it has
been amazing.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:54.460
But if we had some dishes in the sink, maybe
Dan thought that I was going to do them.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.880
I thought that Dan was going to do them.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.040
Then, I say, "Ugh!

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.380
Why didn't you do the dishes?"

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.770
Well, I'm blaming him.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:07.980
But also, I don't have insight into why he
didn't do them.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.750
So, maybe I say, "Why didn't you do them?"

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.850
And he says, "I'm too tired.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:12.850
I don't want do them.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.549
I thought you were going to do them."

00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:21.260
Well, here I didn't realize, "Oh, he's tired,"
and he didn't realize that I thought he was

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.260
going to do.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:28.730
We don't have this spoken communication connection
about who should do it.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:36.090
So this, I feel like this kind of blame can
often be resolved with a couple deep breaths.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.010
Okay, it's just the dishes.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.410
This is small things.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.410
Dan: Yes.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.830
Vanessa: It's choosing your battles.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.830
Dan: Yes.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.820
Vanessa: This is a common expression that
we use in relationships, often with the word

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.820
pick.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.960
Pick your battles or choose your battles.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.990
This word, B-A-T-T-L-E-S, what does it mean
to say pick your battles?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.710
Dan: Pick your battle means don't argue about
everything.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:08.289
If you're going to get angry or frustrated,
then choose something important, not lots

00:20:08.289 --> 00:20:09.409
of little problems.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:11.350
Vanessa: Yeah, we often call this nagging,
N-A-G-G-I-N-G.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.350
Dan: Nagging.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.350
Vanessa: We can imagine the stereotypical,
usually it's a woman, a stereotypical woman

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.640
in a movie.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.620
The wife is saying, "Hey, pick up your clothes.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.820
Why didn't you do that?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.260
Oh, why are you still sleeping?

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.260
Get out of bed.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.260
Blah, blah, blah."

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.260
This is nagging.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.549
Nobody likes nagging.

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:31.950
No one wants to nag, and no one wants to be
nagged.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:37.539
Dan: I think maybe an extra bit of advice,
you said take a deep breath.

00:20:37.539 --> 00:20:39.100
This is a good idea.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.500
Take a deep breath.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:48.150
If you're feeling a little angry at your partner,
before you say something, just breathe.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:53.460
Because, I mean, I know we look very happy
all the time, but we get angry with each other,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.460
too.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.460
Vanessa: It's true.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.460
Dan: I promise you it happens.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.390
I've had to learn, especially me.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:03.299
Sometimes I get a little bit ... I have a
temper.

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:04.299
I can get angry.

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:05.299
Vanessa: He can get upset at times.

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:06.299
Dan: I can get angry sometimes.

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:07.830
Vanessa: I think everybody can get upset sometimes.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:14.490
Dan: So, I've had to learn to stop and take
a little breath before I say something.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.380
Because when you're angry, you might say something
really mean.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:24.500
And if you take ... If you say something really
bad, your partner is going to remember that.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.500
Vanessa: Yes.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.370
Dan: So you don't want to let a lot of those
bad words build up over time.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:35.480
Vanessa: I think we're going to talk about
this more with Dan's third tip about how to

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.679
not let things build up.

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:41.870
Build up means your anger is growing inside
of you and you explode.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.559
In Dan's third tip, we're going to talk more
about that.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:50.630
But before we go on to my tip, I feel like
not blaming, picking your battles, all of

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:56.590
this deals with the category of emotional
regulation.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.520
This is kind of a fancy word.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:04.731
I read this in one of the articles that I
was reading about this topic, relationship

00:22:04.731 --> 00:22:08.520
advice, and I feel like it covers so many
great things.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520
Regulating yourself.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.330
Am I just lashing out?

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.470
Lashing out is like a whip [inaudible 00:22:13]
with your words.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.390
Lashing out, or am I being rational?

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.240
Am I being thoughtful?

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.159
Also, when someone else, if Dan criticizes
me or if Dan says, "Hey, you said you were

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:29.500
going to do the dishes and you didn't do them.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.220
Why didn't you do them?"

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.620
I need to have emotional regulation.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.549
Personally, I don't like it when people tell
me what to do.

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:39.020
I'm very stubborn.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.480
Maybe you're like this, too.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.070
So in this situation, I need to feel okay
with some uncomfortable feelings.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.150
When someone corrects me, I need to take a
deep breath.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:51.940
Okay, I'll do it.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.940
Dan: Yes.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.690
Vanessa: And I can't just yell at him immediately.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.700
I need some emotional regulation.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.110
Dan: Somebody said, "I breathe every morning
to control anger."

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.110
Vanessa: Good idea.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.110
Dan: Words show.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.110
That's a good one.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.110
Breathe every day.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:10.890
Vanessa: Yes, take some deep breaths I think
in this situation, making sure that you are

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:16.030
not immediately getting upset at the other
person and also not getting upset when people

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.030
correct you.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.030
Dan: Yeah, meditation or yoga, that would
probably help with this situation.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.480
And it's more difficult for some people than
others.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.480
Vanessa: Yeah, certainly.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.220
Dan: I know I have more trouble with emotional
regulation than Vanessa, which I think is

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.870
a little unusual.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.860
Maybe the stereotype is that the woman is
usually more emotional.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.049
Vanessa is a very steady person.

00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:40.049
It's amazing.

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:43.710
Vanessa: We can use a great expression here,
even keel.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.120
Dan: Even keeled, yes.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.370
Vanessa: This is E-V-E-N K-E-E-L, even keel.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:56.450
I think this refers to a boat, like a boat
that's flat.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.149
It's not going one way or the other.

00:23:59.149 --> 00:24:04.150
If you are even keeled, it means that you're
not swinging from emotional.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.410
"Oh, I'm really angry."

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.410
Dan: Happy, sad.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.690
Vanessa: "Oh, I'm really happy."

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.770
Yes, or like you're instantly angry.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:10.770
You are even keeled.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.570
Dan: Yeah, steady person is another way to
put it.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:13.570
Steady.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:18.260
Vanessa: So you could say, "I would like to
marry someone who is even keeled," or, "I

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:24.450
need someone who's even keeled so that they
will help me as well to manage myself."

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.450
Dan: Yes.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.760
Vanessa: This really goes with my second tip.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.450
My second tip is quite specific.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.270
It is something that's helped us a lot, which
is-

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.330
Dan: It's even keel.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.330
Vanessa: Yes.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.330
Dan: K-E-E-L.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.330
Vanessa: Oh, great.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.710
Thank you for writing that in the live comments.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.710
That's excellent.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:47.850
My second comment is to delegate chores or
specific tasks.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.110
Dan: A specific one.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:55.200
Vanessa: This is really specific, but I feel
like for me, maybe for me as a woman, in my

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:03.360
experience, usually this chore ... Chores
means doing the dishes, tidying up, cleaning

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.940
the bathroom, sweeping the floor, household
things.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.100
This often is just what the wife does.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:17.570
So if the wife doesn't want to do everything,
it's so important to have a real conversation

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:22.390
together about all topics, especially if this
really bugs you.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.690
Bugs you means bothers you.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.279
If it's something that's really important
to you, don't be afraid to have a conversation

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.279
about it.

00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:29.960
So, Dan and I have done this.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:37.100
We continually do this to change our roles
and to change our specific things that we're

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.100
doing.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.929
But, we say, "Okay.

00:25:39.929 --> 00:25:47.100
So, I feel like I've been doing a lot of laundry,
and maybe the dishes haven't been done often.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.860
So, how can we make this more even?"

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.821
Really, this delegation ... Can you explain
the word delegation or to delegate.

00:25:53.821 --> 00:26:00.570
Dan: Delegate just means that you are choosing
what the different things people are doing.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:06.919
A lot of times, if somebody is a delegator,
like if Vanessa delegates, then she is telling

00:26:06.919 --> 00:26:08.950
everybody what to do.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:14.860
But if we're delegating together, we're both
choosing what chores we want to do.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.669
I would add to this that this definitely depends
on your relationship.

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:24.040
So in some relationship, the man works all
day and the woman works at home.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.250
In that sense, it makes perfect sense for
the woman to do more chores.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.250
Vanessa: The woman to do more.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.250
Sure.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.740
Dan: But, in a lot of lot of relationships
nowadays, both the man and the woman work.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.350
Vanessa: So, you've got a lot of roles to
do.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.090
Dan: Now you have to delegate.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:44.360
Because if the man and the woman are both
working, then you need to decide.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.409
It's more important today to be on a good
connect because you have to choose who is

00:26:49.409 --> 00:26:54.809
doing what in the house, because it's not
really fair if the man and the woman and working

00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:57.740
for the woman to still do all the chores.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.970
That ain't fair.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:59.970
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:05.570
So in this situation, it's really worked well
for us to say, "Okay, Dan always does the

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.659
laundry."

00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:12.960
And I, because we have a toddler, he's one
and a half years old, I feed our baby.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.760
I nurse our baby a lot still.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.940
So, this takes up a lot of my time, so I ... This
is my job.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.019
I feed.

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:24.990
I nurse our toddler and Dan does the laundry.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.550
He has to go all the way to the basement.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.510
He has to wait in the middle of the night
for the laundry to be finished.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.309
This is a difficult task that I don't want
to do.

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:35.470
And he can't nurse our baby.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.470
Dan: Yes.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.470
Vanessa: So here, we delegate.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.610
Dan: And we're saying delegate, D-E-L-E-G-A-T-E,
not delicate.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.720
Vanessa: Yeah, it doesn't have a C. It has
a G.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720
Dan: Delegate.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.880
You can also say negotiate.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.880
Vanessa: We nee to negotiate our roles.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.429
Dan: Negotiate is, "All right, I want to do
this, but I don't really want to do this."

00:27:54.429 --> 00:27:58.779
So, you're deciding and you're giving and
you're taking.

00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:00.880
This is for a lot of relationships as well.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.940
You have to negotiate.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.120
Vanessa: I think the general principle that
we're talking about here is just good communication,

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:13.799
that do not expect your partner, your husband
or your wife, to read your mind.

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:16.570
This means reading your thoughts.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.320
I've noticed that for me ... I think this
is maybe true.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.470
I'm making a lot of generalizations here.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.680
I think it's general-
Dan: You have to.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:32.310
Vanessa: ... generally true that it's good
to be clear and straightforward.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.559
Straightforward means-
Dan: Especially with a man.

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:36.669
Vanessa: ... very clear with your husband.

00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:44.549
That if I beat around the bush, this means
says something indirectly, sometimes Dan doesn't

00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:45.549
get it.

00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:52.710
So, I need to be clear and say, "Oh, there's
... " This is beating around the bush.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:29:00.370
If I said, "Oh, I don't have any socks," that's
beating around the bush.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.919
Being clear is, "Have you done the laundry?

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:05.419
I need more socks."

00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:06.419
Dan: Yes.

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:11.200
Vanessa: This is very clear, so realizing
that the other person cannot read your mind.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.289
If I said, "Oh, I don't want anything for
my birthday.

00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:15.440
You don't need to buy me anything."

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.010
Okay.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:21.720
Maybe he's going to believe that, but really
in my heart I really want a present.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.780
Just tell him.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.750
"I would like a present.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.779
Please find me something special from your
heart.

00:29:26.779 --> 00:29:27.779
Great."

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:28.779
Dan: Yes.

00:29:28.779 --> 00:29:32.090
Although, on the flip side, if you're a guy,
it's better if you know these things already.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:38.360
Vanessa: But, I'm saying as a couple, it's
good to be clear and straightforward.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:44.059
Dan: I think more for things you want in daily
life, not gifts.

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:48.820
Like doing the laundry, it's better to just
say, "Hey, I need the laundry done soon, please."

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.820
Vanessa: Yeah, sure.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.220
Or to just be on top of it.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.220
Dan: That's more direct.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.630
Vanessa: Yes, so let's go on.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:57.250
We said to delegate some chores, delegate
some tasks.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:04.200
Recently, we just booked a special vacation,
and Dan booked our rental car, and I booked

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.390
the places where we're going to stay.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.390
Dan: Oh, yes.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:12.580
We delegated because I said, "I don't want
to plan the vacation, all of the travel details

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.610
where we're going," because I was a little
nervous about that.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.030
But, I said, "I'll plan the transportation.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.799
I'll do the car, and where we're going, and
the driving, and that kind of thing."

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:23.799
Vanessa: Yeah, and I planned.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:24.799
Dan: I'm cool with that.

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:26.870
Vanessa: I planned where we're going to stay,
and Dan planned the car.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.710
This, for me, it split.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.970
It divided the work.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.760
I didn't need to do everything.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.220
Dan didn't need to do everything, but we both
did ... We negotiated some kind of equal thing

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.500
with each other, which is something I really
appreciate about our relationship.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.000
All right, we are going a little bit long
here, so let's go on to-

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Dan: The last one.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.390
Vanessa: ... the third tip, which is very
specific as well.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:53.429
It's something that I think ... I don't know
many other couples who do this, but I think

00:30:53.429 --> 00:30:54.700
it's something that's really worked well for
us.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:00.340
So, what is your third, your third tip, our
fifth tip together, our final tip for the

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.700
healthy-
Dan: My final tip-

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.700
Vanessa: Yes.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.669
Dan: ... for a good and strong relationship-
Vanessa: Yes.

00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:07.630
Dan: ... is to check in regularly.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.740
Vanessa: Check in.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.130
Dan: We have check in.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.559
Vanessa: A wonderful phrasal verb.

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:14.309
Dan: Yes, check in.

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:23.289
This means that you are planning a day or
a date where you are going to talk about important

00:31:23.289 --> 00:31:26.570
things, or you're going to plan a conversation.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.570
Vanessa: Yes.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:32.380
Dan: So if you check in with each other, maybe
you ask, "How are you feeling?

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.679
How are you feeling about- "
Vanessa: Your week.

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:40.721
Dan: " ... the school our kid is going to,"
or, "How do you feel about ... " Yeah, how

00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:41.769
do you feel about the week?

00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.260
Vanessa: How was your week last week?

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.260
Dan: You're checking in.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.260
Vanessa: Yes.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.850
Dan: This is, check in can me a lot of different
things.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:53.230
A lot of times, if you see check in, it just
means that you are going to a hotel and they're

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.850
going to write you in to the hotel.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.929
Vanessa: I'm going to check in to the hotel
at 10 AM.

00:31:57.929 --> 00:31:59.919
But here we're talking about emotionally.

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:05.760
Dan: But if you emotionally check in with
each other, or it might not even be emotional.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.260
It could be the kind of things you're doing
in the week, maybe a little more pragmatic.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.350
Vanessa: So the specific way that this plays
out ... Plays out is another phrasal verbs

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:24.559
that this goes in our relationship is we have
meetings once a week every Sunday when our

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:28.429
baby, our toddler, our child, is taking a
nap.

00:32:28.429 --> 00:32:30.179
We have an organized meeting.

00:32:30.179 --> 00:32:31.850
Dan: We call it a meeting.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.289
It's not really a meeting.

00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:34.460
Vanessa: It's organized.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.360
I think that sometimes a date, you just eat
together and talk together about anything,

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:45.350
but I really appreciate that it's organized
because we were talking about before letting

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.559
your anger build up.

00:32:47.559 --> 00:32:49.290
This is terrible thing for you.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:50.649
It's terrible for your relationship.

00:32:50.649 --> 00:32:54.980
But I know every Sunday we're going to have
a meeting.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:00.250
So if there's something big that I want to
talk about, I can talk about it on ... Of

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.590
course I can talk about it at that moment
if I wanted to.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.460
Dan: "Would you say check in is analyze?"

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.460
Somebody asked.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.720
Vanessa: Oh, we could analyze our week.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.720
Dan: If we're checking in.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.850
Vanessa: Checking in with each other.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.880
Dan: It could have some analyzation.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.880
Analyzation?

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880
Vanessa: Sure, you can analyze each other.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.190
Dan: You can analyze.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.030
Vanessa: Or analyze your week.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:23.190
Dan: Yeah, it's more just a time to really
... It's where you say it's okay to talk about

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.650
maybe the problems of the week or how you
felt.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:32.840
So for example, in our check-in time, in our
meeting, we always rate the week one to five.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.710
Vanessa: Let's talk about how do we start.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.590
So, on Sunday, our child takes a nap.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:44.580
We usually drink some tea or coffee, and we
sit down at the dinner table.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.830
What's the first thing that we do?

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:46.830
This is just what we created.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.830
Dan: This is what we do.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:48.830
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:53.380
Dan: So first, we try to say two things that
we appreciate about each other.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.380
Vanessa: Something very specific.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.470
Dan: We try to say something nice about each
other.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.500
Vanessa: Because often, maybe there's some
kind of criticism.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.530
"Oh, I was really upset because you didn't
do the laundry for three days."

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.750
There's can be some things that are a little
bit difficult that we talk about, so it's

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.670
always good to start with something positive.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:15.990
So for us, we say, "I appreciate that you
made an amazing dinner last night.

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:22.460
I also was really thankful that you took our
car to the mechanic to get the oil changed."

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.150
Okay, simple, clear, very specific.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.430
And for me, it feels-
Dan: Women like this a lot.

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:29.680
Vanessa: It feels really good.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:35.480
It feels really good because I know that I
do a lot of things, and I know that Dan doesn't

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.430
need to say, "Thank you for picking up our
baby's toys.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:41.340
Thank you for doing this."

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.340
Dan: Yes.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.340
Vanessa: He doesn't need to say thank you
for everything.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.340
Dan: I appreciate this.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.340
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.340
Dan: Yeah, you don't go through everything.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.340
Just choose two specific things.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.340
Vanessa: So it makes me feel good.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.340
Dan: "Wow.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.800
I really appreciated that you watched Theo."

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.420
Theo's our baby.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.340
"I appreciate you watched Theo for two hours
while I went to a movie," for example.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.560
Vanessa: "While I exercised.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560
Thank you."

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.560
Dan: "Wow.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.560
That was really great of you."

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.740
Vanessa: And it feels good to be appreciated.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.780
So, this is what we do at the very beginning.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.260
Then, what happens next?

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.410
Dan: Then we rank our week, right?

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.070
One to five, how was our week?

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.450
"My week was a 3.5."

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:15.450
Vanessa: And why.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.450
Dan: And then why.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:17.450
Vanessa: What happened?

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.450
Dan: "Yeah, well, blah, blah, blah."

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:23.740
You go over what liked about the week, what
you didn't like, how it could be better.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.800
So if you do this every week, then you're
kind of ... You're checking in with each other.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.540
Then, you're thinking, "Well, what could make
the next week a little better."

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.320
Vanessa: And you used a great phrasal verb
here.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320
You go over the week.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.910
Go over doesn't mean literally over.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.260
Here, it means you're just discussing.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.410
You're going in detail about the week.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:53.360
"I rate this past week a 3.8 because this
happened, but also this happened."

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.370
It helps you to kind of review the week.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:03.380
Then, if something made you feel negative,
it's a good time to say, "Oh, but I didn't

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.380
sleep enough.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.980
I felt so tired all week.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.720
So, maybe this week I'm going to try to do
something better."

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:15.530
And that's kind of the next part, is we talk
about the details of ... "Next week, here's

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.530
our plans.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.560
Next week, I'm going to try to go to bed at
this time.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.310
I have a lot of work to do, so I'm going to
try to do it in the morning.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.230
How can we work together?"

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.640
It's like a meeting.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.660
I feel like it's like a meeting.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.660
Dan: Yes.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.440
Vanessa: It's pretty organized, but-
Dan: And again, another ... One more disclaimer

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:40.200
is this is very important for us because we
have a very open schedule.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.930
We don't have traditional jobs.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.970
So if you don't have a traditional job, if
you're an entrepreneur, if you spend a lot

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.670
of time working together, like we have to
work together-

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.670
Vanessa: A lot for everything.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.180
Dan: So, we're almost like business partners,
really.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.320
So, it's important to do this.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.030
Some other people, I think you could do this
maybe once a month because maybe the man is

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.210
working here and the woman's here, and they're
a little more separate.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.430
You know, that's okay, too.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.990
You don't have to do everything together.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:12.090
Vanessa: Something that we often do during
this meeting, we've missed a little bit, but

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:19.710
for about three maybe four years, once a month
during that meeting, we keep track of our

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.860
budget.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:25.770
I know that money fights are often the biggest
problems in relationships.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.610
Dan: You should talk about money.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.010
If you're married, you got to talk about money
[inaudible 00:37:29].

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:35.690
Vanessa: Something that has been good for
us is we have an Excel spreadsheet.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:40.670
This is quite detailed into our personal life,
but we have an Excel spreadsheet and at the

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.810
end of the month we look at our bank account.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.780
"Okay, here's a grocery store purchase," and
we put it in the Excel spreadsheet and we

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.780
add up.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.740
We spent this much money for groceries.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.890
We add up.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:57.700
We spent this much money for car gas.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.430
When you can look at the numbers, it helps
you together to see the facts.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:07.790
It's not me being upset because we spent too
much money, Dan being upset because I bought

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:08.790
something.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.790
Dan: Yes.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:10.790
Vanessa: No, we just see the facts.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.780
Dan: And this would be a situation where you
can't blame or make excuses.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.680
Vanessa: Yeah, because there's the facts.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:19.250
So, I feel like for me, I love to save money.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.490
Dan does not spend very much money, but he
doesn't-

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.840
Dan: I spend more money than you.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.470
Vanessa: He spends a little bit more than
me.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.240
We're quite similar that we don't spend a
lot of money.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:37.980
But for me, it feels so nice to see our money
on a paper and to know, "Okay, we can ... " It

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.130
gives me permission to ... We can go out to
a restaurant.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:42.430
It's fine.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.120
It gives me permission to relax a little bit.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.730
Or maybe for you, if your finances are tight,
I talked about this in a recent YouTube video

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:57.690
about learning English for free, you can know,
"Okay, maybe we need to not go out to a restaurant."

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:04.080
If one of you, your husband or your wife spends
a lot of money, this is a good way to be clear

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.800
and honest in your relationship and look at
your finances together.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:15.000
I know that a lot of people don't do this
and that when they do this, it gives so much

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
relaxation.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.690
It relieves so much stress because usually
one person in your relationship feels more

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.350
stress about money than the other person.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:29.120
So, it's really nice to be on the same page.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.970
This is a great expression.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.070
You are on the same, like a piece of paper.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.070
On the same page.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.280
Dan: We're on the same page.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280
Vanessa: Yes.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280
Dan: We agree.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280
Vanessa: Yes.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.280
Dan: That's basically what it means.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.280
Vanessa: It just means you both agree.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:46.160
I want to be on the same page with you, so
let's check in with each other once a week.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.730
Let's do some fun activity together.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.490
Let's go hiking together and try to have fun
and relieve our stresses.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.160
So, these are our general tips.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.260
Dan: These are our tips.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.030
I would just say remember number one.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.140
That's the most important.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.400
Vanessa: Make sure you're a good fit.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.830
Dan: Get in the relationship with the right
person.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.150
Because let's say you want to talk about money.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:13.260
It's going to be very hard to talk about money
with somebody who is irresponsible with money.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:18.360
You have to make sure the person you're getting
in a relationship with is already good money.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.720
Otherwise, it's going to be-
Vanessa: Quite difficult.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.720
Dan: ... even more challenging.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.720
Vanessa: Yes.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.280
Dan: But, that to say it's not impossible.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.930
You might be in a relationship with somebody
who's not good with money.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.540
You can still work something out.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:36.670
Vanessa: I think that something for us, if
we have ... Let's imagine, hypothetically,

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:41.090
that I'm really bad with money and Dan is
really good with money.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:45.420
If Dan is really concerned about this, it's
probably a problem anyway.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:52.000
But if Dan is concerned about it, he can't
... Maybe I'm looking at my phone.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.730
He can't say to me all of a sudden, "Hey!

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.550
Why did we have this purchase?

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.610
What are you doing?"

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.710
I'm not in the right mindset to discuss this.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:06.420
So, I feel like something that's worked for
us when there's a problem that's really important

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:12.960
to one of us, saying, "Hey, when you have
a moment, can we talk about something really

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.551
important," or, "I saw this purchase here
and it's really important to me that we talk

00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:19.551
about it."

00:41:19.551 --> 00:41:21.380
Be serious.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:26.610
It's important to you, so don't just have
... Make sure you have emotional regulation.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:30.470
Don't just explode about it, but say, "Hey,
this is really important.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:31.470
Can we talk about?"

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.240
And look at each other's eyes.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.400
Look at each other and say, "Hey, this is
really important to me.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.270
Can we please go through our finances?

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:45.060
Let's go through our bank account and make
a list and see how much we're spending.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.210
This would really be important to me."

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.230
Try to appeal to their care for you.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.260
Dan cares for me.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.680
I care for him.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.880
So if he says, "This is so important to me.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.160
Let's please talk about it," of course.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:01.580
I want to Dan to be not stressed.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:07.960
So when you take the time to talk about something
important like that, it means so much more.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:13.261
If you just said, "Hey, what are you doing?"
and then I'm doing something else, it's just

00:42:13.261 --> 00:42:16.920
going to create an argument because my mind
is not there.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.370
Dan's emotional regulation is everywhere.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.810
So, talking a moment, "Can we really talk
about this?

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.830
This is so important to me."

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.270
Dan: Yeah, or, "Can we talk about this later?"

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:26.270
Vanessa: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.470
That's really-
Dan: That [inaudible 00:42:26] that can help,

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.470
too.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.470
You don't want to talk.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.800
You want to bring up stuff in the moment all
of the sudden.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.800
That really helps.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.400
Somebody said they're confused about which
number we're on.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.480
I don't think we've been organized.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.500
Sorry, everybody.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.120
Vanessa: Dan wrote three tips.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.120
I wrote two tips.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.420
So, we had one tip, one tip, one tip, one
tip, one tip, one tip, one tip.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:46.690
So, Dan has three.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.240
I know we said we have five tips.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.260
There's five total.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.950
Dan: But, we've been adding a lot of stuff,
so ...

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.950
Vanessa: Yes.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:55.400
We're talking about now the conclusion.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:00.310
So, the reason why I wanted to talk about
this kind of unusual topic today, giving just

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.270
our personal relationship advice, is for two
reasons.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:13.590
Number one, Valentine's Day is coming quite
soon, so you might be preparing for your relationship,

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.810
something for your relationship, maybe thinking
about relationships a little bit more.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.770
Valentine's Day is coming up in February.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:27.940
And number two is in our monthly English course,
the Fearless Fluency Club, we have a special

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.170
set in February.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:35.350
This is where I interview a therapist.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:36.350
Dan: Ooh.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.530
Vanessa: She's not a relationship therapist.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:41.010
She is an eating disorder therapist.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.010
Dan: Very different.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:46.540
Vanessa: But, she is a therapist and she deals
with people who are coming to her with problems.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:50.530
So, I kind of wanted to imitate that a little
bit.

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:56.060
So, what I'd like to do now is I would like
to share my screen with you to show you if

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.670
you would like to continue to learn with us,
if you would like to continue this idea of

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.720
deepening your English through real English
conversations-

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.910
Dan: Yes, and in a more organized fashion.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.370
This is more a causal conversation-
Vanessa: This is a casual chitchat.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.480
Dan: ... we're having with you today.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480
Vanessa: Yes.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.880
So, I would like to share my screen with you
to show you.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.920
Let's take a look here.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:21.730
You can see this is our Fearless Fluency Club
page where you can click the link in the description

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.300
and join our course.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.360
You can find out much more information about
each of the lessons here.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:35.110
But what I'd like to do is give you a little
sneak preview into the February lesson set.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:39.380
Here you can see February 2019.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:46.430
We have each month there is a special ... This
is a course guide in general for how to use

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:47.430
the course.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:51.460
This is a monthly lesson set guide.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.770
We're going to be talking about therapy with
Elaine.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:59.160
Elaine is a professional counselor or therapist.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:05.160
In this lesson set, we talk about a lot of
vocabulary that she used in our conversation.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.160
Dan: Hey look.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.160
There's blame.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.530
Vanessa: Oh, we talked about blame.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:09.530
Wonderful.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.790
Oh, you're already ahead of the game.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.340
Then, we talk about grammar.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:20.080
Oh, we're going to be talking about really,
so, too, these kind of intensifiers, at all.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.050
I noticed we used at all in our conversation,
actually.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.700
Then, we talk about some specific pronunciation.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.370
So, let's take a look.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.650
Here you can see the vocabulary lesson with
Dan and I.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.980
There's two parts to this vocabulary lesson.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:41.450
The grammar lesson where I explain these important
expressions for intensifying your conversation.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:42.980
There's an MP3.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.450
You can download it.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:49.870
Also, the transcript of the full lesson so
that you can follow word for word.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:56.130
This is helpful for everyone, but it's especially
helpful if you are maybe a high beginning,

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:00.320
low intermediate, because it's good to catch
every single word.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:05.560
Then, we have the pronunciation lesson so
you can learn some specific pronunciation

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.560
tips.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.810
If you have watched any of my pronunciation
lessons here on YouTube, this lesson is quite

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:10.810
similar.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:14.000
We shadow, and repeat, and practice individual
sounds.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.740
Then, we have the special conversation with
my friend Elaine, who is an eating disorder

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:21.900
therapist.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:28.420
She talks about going to therapy, this process
of helping people with something that's really

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:33.550
personal, really personal, and sharing that
with a stranger and how she helps people,

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:37.170
especially she helps young people in her field.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.040
But, she goes through this and talks about
it in detail.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.100
It's quite interesting to see the insight
into her job.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.690
Then, in the course, we have the story.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.200
The story is a unique thing here.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.870
We have different audio recordings of the
story.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:47:00.440
This is a combination of all the vocabulary,
grammar, pronunciation, plus some extra vocabulary

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.900
from the full lesson set.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.120
This is about going to therapy.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.200
It's kind of a fiction story.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:13.430
But, you can use and see all of the vocabulary
in a different context.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:18.850
So, I hope that this will help to just add
to your knowledge of the vocabulary and grammar

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.470
and see it in a different context.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:24.640
There are questions so you can practice answering
questions.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.700
It's kind of a controlled speaking practice
and also different verb tenses so that you

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.080
can practice different verb tenses.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:35.460
All right, I'm going to bring back our video
here.

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:40.780
So if you would like to join us monthly in
the Fearless Fluency Club and to practice

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:48.990
these conversations together with us, you
are welcome to join the Fearless Fluency Club

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:52.180
now in January or in February.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.440
If you join in January, you'll get the January
lesson set immediately.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:01.650
Then, in the month of February, February 1st,
you'll get access to this special lesson set

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:02.650
with Elaine.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:09.390
It is $35 per month, but please use the coupon
code new.

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:14.380
If you use the coupon code new, N-E-W, you
only get it for $5.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.380
Dan: $5.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.290
Vanessa: You have a $30 discount, which is
great for the first month.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:20.500
Try the course.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.500
You pay $5.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.750
If you don't like it, cancel.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:27.930
If it's a good fit for you, you can continue
in the course and your English will grow day

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:28.930
by day.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.080
You're welcome to join us.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.270
Many members speak together on Skype and Google
Hangouts weekly, daily.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.530
They practice speaking together.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.930
This is a great way to meet friends from around
the world.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:39.930
Dan: Yes.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.480
Vanessa: Also, you're not paying for expensive
Skype lessons.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.590
Instead, you're speaking with other people
who are also learning, who are like you.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.590
Dan: It's a community.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.670
Vanessa: Yes, so you can feel comfortable
speaking with them.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.820
And at the end of each month, we have a group
Google Hangout with me so you'll be able to

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.570
chat with me in this group Google Hangout.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.570
It's super fun.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.200
We have a good time together and you get just
a chance to meet each other and also meet

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.420
me and practice speaking a bit.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.120
But, thank you so much for joining me.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.560
I want to know in the comments, what is your
number one relationship tips?

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.680
Dan: Yeah, share your tips.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.680
Vanessa: Yes.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.680
Dan: Tell us.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.680
Vanessa: Yes.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.680
Dan: How can we have a better relationship?

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.680
Vanessa: Yes, of course.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.070
We are always open to expanding, and growing,
and strengthening our relationship, but also

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:20.070
for other people.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:24.410
It's interesting to see what worked for you,
maybe what didn't work for you.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:26.790
Give us some things not to do.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:31.930
So, I hope that this lesson has been useful
to you and we'll see you again next Friday

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.710
for a new lesson here on my YouTube channel.

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.060
I'll see you again the next time.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.060
Dan: Bye, everybody.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:37.380
Vanessa: Bye.
