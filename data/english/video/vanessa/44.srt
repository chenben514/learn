Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.640
Do you want to learn English with songs?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:17.070
Let's talk about 11 songs that are awesome
for learning about English.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.489
For me, when I listen to songs, I feel energized,
and excited, I feel optimistic about life,

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.390
and I hope that this is the same for you,
especially when you listen to music in English,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.890
because there's times in your English journey
when you feel down, you feel like you're not

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.680
going anywhere, you're not improving, and
I hope that music, especially the songs that

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.380
I'm going to share with you today will help
to boost your spirits, and also help you to

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.470
get comfortable speaking and using English.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.220
Why are songs good for learning English?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.870
A lot of songs use multiple verb tenses, expressions,
phrasal verbs, idioms, a lot of useful daily

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.719
language, and they help you to speak if you're
willing to sing, so if you are willing to

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:12.159
sing along with the chorus, sing along with
the singer, you're going to be able to use

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.159
English.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.450
You didn't need to make the sentences yourself,
so you're just able to speak and imitate,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.680
and hopefully have this positive, optimistic
attitude.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.920
Before I share these 11 songs with you, I
want to address a question that I'm sure a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.909
lot of you are thinking, "Vanessa, English
songs are so fast.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.590
How in the world can I understand each of
the words?"

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.139
I have a couple suggestions.

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:41.679
First of all, you can look up the lyrics.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.259
Lyrics are the words of the song.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.479
Look up the lyrics on Google, even print them
out if you want, listen to them, read them,

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.749
try to follow along as the singer is singing,
or on YouTube, there are a lot of versions

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:01.590
of the songs that include lyrics, so the lyrics
will follow as you're watching the video,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.659
and that's really helpful, even if you just
memorize the chorus.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.530
The chorus is the part that repeats a lot
again and again.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.580
If you just memorize the chorus, you're already
using English.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.590
You're speaking.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.450
You're using those muscles, and that's so
valuable.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.960
The first four songs that I'm going to share
with you are older songs.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.180
That doesn't mean that if you grew up with
these songs, you are old.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.730
It just means that they're not from the past
10 years.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.020
They're older than 10 years.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.140
Then, the next four songs are more poppy,
more current songs that came out in the last

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.140
10 years.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.530
Then, the final three songs are just some
miscellaneous songs that I thought would be

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.870
useful to include.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.890
You can find the links to all of these.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.920
They're YouTube videos.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.550
My preferred YouTube video, you can find them
in the comments so that you can watch every

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.100
single one of these songs, and that's my challenge
for you, to choose one or all of these, spend

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.000
some time feeling happy, and using English.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.580
My first recommendation is Billy Joel's song,
'Uptown Girl'.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.190
In this song, you're going to learn some great
expressions like, "Get a choice", "Get tired

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.520
of", "Fall in love with someone".

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.140
These are just daily life expressions, but
this music is kind of like 1950's style, but

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.600
it was made in the 1980's, so it has some
really great, catchy tunes, catchy chorus,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.680
and I hope that it will help you with your
English.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.010
The second song that I recommend is from a
band that is considered the most important

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.700
for helping English learners learn English.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.670
Can you guess what band that is?

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.240
It's The Beatles.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.020
I could have a full video giving you recommendations
for Beatles songs, but I realized that a lot

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.460
of people already know the Beatles, so I chose
one that I think is really important, and

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.930
that is 'We Can Work It Out'.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.760
It's short, fun, it includes a great phrasal
verb, "We can work it out", and you're going

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.620
to feel like you can repeat these songs again
and again because it's going to repeat some

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.800
of the same words.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.760
You're going to learn expressions like, "Time
can tell".

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.820
I hope that this will help you to add to your
vocabulary.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.680
My third recommendation is Leonard Cohen's
song, 'Hallelujah'.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.780
In the description of this video, I actually
didn't include his version.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.620
I included a Pentatonix version because I
feel like this is maybe a little more modern

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.130
sounding that's full of energy.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.150
It's your choice which one you think is better,
but I wanted to include this song because

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.170
there are a lot of great verbs, and also,
the style of speaking is slow, but it's still

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.530
filled with energy, so you're going to want
a lot of great verbs, and also, you're going

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.210
to hear the present perfect a lot, "I've walked",
"I've seen", "I've gone".

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.780
You're going to hear that, and I hope that
all of these songs really will include verb

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.450
tenses that are going to feel more comfortable
to you after you listen to the songs.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:08.790
My fourth and final recommendation for somewhat
older songs is from Queen, 'Somebody To Love'.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.490
Every time that I listen to Queen, I get so
much energy, and I always think, "Why don't

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.280
I listen to Queen more often?"

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.940
For some reason, this is the perfect style
of music for me, so I tried to choose a song

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.380
that wasn't too challenging, but it also had
some great things that you can use for learning

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.380
English.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.780
In this song, they repeat the question again
and again, "Can anybody find me somebody to

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.780
love?"

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.340
Here, you're going to practice question sentence
structure, and even though the words are a

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.750
little tough, I recommend checking out the
lyrics and trying to follow along, even if

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.290
you just sing the chorus.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.560
This is going to give you a lot of energy,
and I hope positive feelings about English.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.170
My fifth recommendation comes from my pop
song recommendations that are a little more

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.230
modern.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.250
This one is Jason Mraz's song, 'I'm Yours'.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.691
Unfortunately, Dan does not like this song,
my husband, so he didn't want me to include

00:06:09.691 --> 00:06:16.230
it in this list, but I feel like he speaks
so clearly that it's great for pronunciation.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.470
If you can repeat the chorus, it's going to
help your speaking muscles, so even though

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.510
some people don't like this song, I hope that
you'll enjoy it, and I hope that you'll be

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.470
able to repeat these words as well.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.570
I do want to let you know that he includes
a grammar mistake in the chorus, and this

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.090
is pretty typical, and I want to try to explain
why maybe he chose to use a mistake.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.020
In English, it's not a good idea to use a
double negative.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.990
That means two negative words in the same
sentence.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:54.120
He says, "I won't hesitate no more", and here,
he's using the word 'Not' and 'No', so there's

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.150
two negatives.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:02.210
Technically, he should say, "I won't hesitate
anymore", but he's a songwriter, so we say

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.770
that he has poetic license.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.550
He can do what he wants if it makes him feel
more comfortable, and it makes the song flow

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.150
better to have a mistake.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.150
Okay.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.330
Whatever, but I wanted to let you know that
he is including this, and maybe it's because

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.560
when they listen to that song, they'll recognize
it as a mistake, but it's a song, so we kind

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.590
of are a little more flexible when it comes
to songs and grammar.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.320
It needs to rhyme, it needs to feel good,
and he just chose to use this.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.060
My sixth recommendation is Pharrell Williams'
'Happy'.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.150
This song is really popular, and if you can
memorize the chorus, sing, sing, sing.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:48.130
Try to sing it as much as possible because
not only is it filled with optimism, but it

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.910
also repeats a lot of the same words, so I
hope that they will stick with you, and that

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.620
fixed sentence structure will help you to
build on your own sentence structure that

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.010
you already know in English.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.790
That's why songs are great for you.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.070
There's a fixed sentence structure, and you're
just repeating it, but hopefully having a

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.070
good time.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.750
I want to let you know that in his song, he
also uses a mistake, and it's the same mistake

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.820
that you saw in the previous song.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.090
It's a double negative.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.220
Here, he is just using his poetic license
to have this song feel the way he wants, but

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.500
he says, "Can't nothing bring me down."

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.790
Here, we have 'Not' and 'Nothing'.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:30.020
Two negatives, but really, it should be, "Nothing
can bring me down."

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.720
We're taking out 'Not', but he uses it, and
he thinks that it's going to feel good in

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.830
the song, and he's the artist.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.640
It's his choice, right?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.580
The seventh song that I recommend is also
a pop song, and it's kind of my guilty pleasure

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.800
song.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.210
Guilty pleasure means that I'm a little bit
embarrassed, but I like this song, but it's

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.360
just so fun.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.770
I can't help it.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.880
It is Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call Me Maybe'.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.510
I'm sure you've heard this song.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.030
There are plenty of parodies on YouTube.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:08.130
That means that people took the same idea
for the song, but added different words, and

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.820
it's perfect for that kind of thing.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.180
In this song, you're going to learn a lot
of great expressions.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.040
She uses a lot of phrasal verbs and daily
life expressions that I hope will be useful

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.040
to you.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.600
Some examples are "Just", or "Look right at
someone", or, "Came into my life".

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.100
These are phrasal verbs and daily life expressions.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.750
The eighth pop song is the ultimate pop song.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.360
It is Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off', and of
course you're going to learn the phrasal verb,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.740
"Shake off something", but this includes a
lot of repetitions, so it's perfect for pronunciation.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.430
The chorus of this song repeats the same words
again, and again, and again, "Play, play,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.310
play, play, play", "Hate, hate, hate, hate,
hate."

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.670
She repeats these words, so I hope it will
help your pronunciation, and also your sentence

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.370
structure, and hopefully your optimism too.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:06.311
The idea of this song is if someone is hating
what you're doing, don't worry about it.

00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:09.040
Shake it off, so this is a great idea for
English.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.590
If you make a mistake, poof.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.750
Shake it off.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.900
Don't worry about it, feel better about it,
and forget it.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.290
Shake it off.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.880
The final three songs are in another category.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.430
They're not really older songs.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.010
They're not really pop songs, but I wanted
to include them today.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:32.700
The first one is the song 'Jolene', and I
added the version that Miley Cyrus sings,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.580
but Dolly Parton was the original singer of
this song.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:43.140
This song is a country song, and it's about
revenge and jealousy, kind of the opposite

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.310
of 'Happy' and 'Shake It Off'.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.170
It's about revenge and jealousy, and you're
going to learn a lot of great descriptions

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.550
of people.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:57.510
They're describing a woman in this song with
auburn hair and ivory skin, so you're going

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.970
to learn these adjectives that also ways to
describe someone.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.750
My 10th recommendation is Ed Sheeran's song,
'Perfect'.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.700
This song has a lot of words, but he speaks
clearly.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.339
It's a kind of slow, love ballad, but it's
also filled with energy and positivity.

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:20.709
He uses some great expressions that native
speakers use a lot, such as, "Whisper underneath

00:11:20.709 --> 00:11:24.260
my breath", or "Fight against all odds".

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.510
These are kind of like idioms, but they're
more like daily expressions, so through this

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:35.660
song, I recommend watching either the lyrical
video or looking at the lyrics on a paper,

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:41.350
and really going over these and singing with
it, trying to feel passionate with this song.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:48.279
My final and 11th recommendation comes from
the internationally loved band, Maroon 5.

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.839
It is the song, 'This Love'.

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:56.080
There are also a lot of words in this song
like the previous Ed Sheeran song, but you

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080
can do it.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.340
This song is infused with a lot of energy,
and he uses some great expressions, such as,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.180
"Take a toll on me".

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.240
This is something that might be new for you,
so when you encounter new expressions like

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.060
this, I recommend looking them up, asking
someone, researching, trying to use this and

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.110
find out what it means because you're going
to get a bigger picture of the song, and then

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.360
when you hear it, sing along with it.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.660
You can use it yourself, and it's a great
way to use new expressions.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:30.029
All right, my challenge for you is to check
out some of the links for these songs, listen

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:37.200
to as many as possible, and choose one that
you can look at the lyrics, and try to repeat

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200
after them.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.959
This is a great way to shadow, but also have
some positive energy around English.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.560
Hopefully, it will boost you.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.050
Maybe it will give you a boost in the morning
when you're getting ready.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:52.100
Hopefully, it will help you to feel positive
and optimistic about your English journey

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.820
because I know it's not always easy, so songs
are a great way to pick up your spirits.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.820
Choose one of these.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.140
Let me know in the comments which one of these
would you like to listen to.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.650
Do you have any other songs that you'd like
to recommend to other people to listen to?

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.580
Thanks such much for learning with me, and
I'll see you the next time.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.580
Bye.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.840
