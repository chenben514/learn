00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.710
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.730
Are you ready to test your English skills?

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.740
Let's get started.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:16.369
Today, I have a new type of video for you.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.499
Over the last three years, I've created a
lot of English tests on my YouTube channel.

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:27.489
These tests are about vocabulary, grammar,
phrasal verbs, listening, fluency, and a lot

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:28.669
of other topics.

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.079
Today, I'm going to compile all of these tests
together into one mega test.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.579
I challenge you to try to do all of these
English tests one time.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.690
I know that it's a lot of time to dedicate,
but it's a good way to immerse yourself in

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.329
English and to really challenge yourself to
see, can I learn these concepts?

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.910
Do I know these concepts?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.100
I hope you learn a lot of great new things
and also you review some things that you've

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100
already learnt.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.430
Vanessa: I know it's two and a half hours,
but it's way more fun than taking a school

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.390
entrance exam that's for the same amount of
time.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.570
Let's get started.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.600
Today, I'm going to test your listening skills.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.130
Do you want to understand fast native speakers
in movies and TV shows and in regular daily

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.130
conversations?

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.130
Yes.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.000
There are countless reductions and linking
in spoken English, so the best way to study

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.759
this is to study real conversations, and that's
what we're going to do.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.810
You're going to hear five short conversations.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.079
For each conversation, you're going to see
three words.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.119
What I want you to do is I want you to listen
carefully for which word is used in that conversation.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.509
Are you ready for the first conversation?

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.670
I want you to listen carefully for the word
all right, although, or almost.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.259
Vanessa: Which word do you hear in the conversation?

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.259
Let's listen.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.689
Dan: [Listen carefully!]

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.320
[Listen carefully!]

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.329
[Listen carefully!]

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.289
[Listen carefully!]

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.380
Vanessa: Which word did you hear?

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.200
Although, all right, almost?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.630
I hope that you heard the word although.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.410
Dan used the word although to contrast to
something that he previously said.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.480
He said that, "We have our own phones.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.910
We don't share a phone, but in the past we
did share a phone."

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.310
He said, "Although in the past we shared a
phone."

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.190
He's showing that he's contrasting between
something that's happening now and something

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.820
that used to happen before.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.760
Let's listen again to that quick conversation
and we're going to listen to the key sentence.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.190
I want you to listen for the word although.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.290
Dan: I have my own phone.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.920
We don't share these things, although for
a time we did share a smartphone.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.920
I have my own phone.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.840
We don't share these things, although for
a time we did share a smartphone.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.010
Vanessa: Did you hear that keyword although?

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.540
I hope so.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.950
Let's move on to the second conversation,
and I want you to listen for three keywords,

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.400
interested, eager, or involved.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.790
Which one do you hear?

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.790
Let's listen.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.140
Faith: [Listen carefully!]

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.140
[Listen carefully!]

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.240
[Listen carefully!]

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.360
[Listen carefully!]

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.620
Vanessa: Which word did you hear?

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.460
Interested, eager, or involved?

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.450
I hope you heard the word involved.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.870
In this conversation, Faith said this keyword
involved pretty quickly.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.510
She explains that when she was younger, she
was really shy, but her mom wanted to encourage

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.700
her to participate in events, or we could
say to get involved.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.820
It means to participate in events.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.530
I also used another word, optimum, that I
talked about in a recent vocabulary quiz here

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.530
on my YouTube channel.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.900
You can watch it up here if you'd like to
learn more about that word.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.750
Let's listen to the key sentence again and
I want you to listen for the word involved.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.770
Faith: I was just really shy and timid, and
it was hard for my mom because she wanted

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.780
to get me involved in things.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.879
I was just really shy and timid, and it was
hard for my mom because she wanted to get

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.639
me involved in things.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.560
Vanessa: Did you hear that word?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.610
I hope so.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.460
Let's move on to conversation number three.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.870
You're going to be listening for one of these
three words, challenge, change, or child.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.229
Which one is in the conversation?

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.229
Let's listen.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:50.219
Brad: [Listen carefully!]

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.729
[Listen carefully!]

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:01.139
[Listen carefully!]

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.300
[Listen carefully!]

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.830
Vanessa: Which word did you hear?

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.990
Challenge, change, or child?

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.379
I hope you heard the word change.

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.410
In this conversation, Brad said that he loves
to visit family occasionally.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.360
Occasionally means maybe three times a year,
not every day, because he enjoys seeing how

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.430
things are different each time when he sees
his family.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.080
Things have changed each time when he sees
his family.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.569
Let's listen to that clip one more time.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.499
I want you to hear that keyword change.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.939
We'll listen to that sentence.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:35.939
All right.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:43.499
Brad: Well, I think visiting family is a wonderful
thing and part of what makes it so wonderful

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:47.009
is getting to see them change and grow every
time you see them.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:54.419
Well, I think visiting family is a wonderful
thing and part of what makes it so wonderful

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.590
is getting to see them change and grow every
time you see them.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.529
Vanessa: Did you hear the word change?

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:00.560
I hope so.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.550
Let's go onto the fourth conversation.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.550
We're going to be listening for one of these
three words, teen, two, or 10.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.969
These are number related words, so listen
carefully.

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:14.969
[Listen carefully!]

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.599
[Listen carefully!]

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.770
[Listen carefully!]

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.910
Sarah: [Listen carefully!]

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.580
[Listen carefully!]

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.099
Vanessa: [Listen carefully!]

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.699
[Listen carefully!]

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.050
[Listen carefully!]

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.189
Sarah: [Listen carefully!]

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:37.360
[Listen carefully!]

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.139
Vanessa: Which word did you hear?

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:45.319
I hope you heard that Sarah has been a massage
therapist, someone who gives massages, for

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.319
how many years?

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.360
10 years.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.939
I hope you heard the word 10.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.560
Listening for numbers is essential in conversation.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.819
If you'd like to practice pronouncing some
of the most difficult numbers, you can watch

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:02.470
this lesson, which is how to pronounce the
top 33 most difficult words.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.470
All right.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.409
Let's listen to that key sentence again and
see if you can hear the word 10.

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:10.409
How did you start this?

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:12.099
Let's start at the very beginning.

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.289
How did you get into massage therapy?

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.430
Sarah: Okay.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.040
I became a massage therapist about 10 years
ago.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.629
Vanessa: How did you start this?

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:24.400
Let's start at the very beginning.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.569
How did you get into massage therapy?

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:28.710
Sarah: Okay.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.750
I became a massage therapist about 10 years
ago.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.840
Vanessa: Did you hear the word 10?

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.039
I hope so.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:41.330
Let's move on to the fifth and final listening
quiz question, which I think is the most tricky.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:48.199
Listen carefully for the word especially,
specifically or special.

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:49.240
Let's listen.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.289
Anna: [Listen carefully!]

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:57.789
[Listen carefully!]

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:00.319
[Listen carefully!]

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:03.050
[Listen carefully!]

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:08.589
[Listen carefully!]

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.059
[Listen carefully!]

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:13.509
Vanessa: Which word did you hear?

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.610
Did you hear the word especially?

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:22.599
This is technically the correct word, but
in this conversation, Anna uses a common spoken

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:24.930
reduction for the word especially.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.999
She cuts off the E at the beginning and she
says 'specially.

00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:30.430
'Specially.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.430
This is pretty common.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.729
It might be a little bit tricky to hear the
first time around.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.690
We'll listen to it again in just a moment
so that you can hear it.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.510
Listen for especially.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.210
In this conversation, Anna mentions that it's
expensive to own a horse, so sometimes multiple

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.380
people will buy one horse and they'll share
the expenses.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.820
Let's listen to this key sentence again and
listen for the word especially that has been

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.040
reduced to 'specially.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.640
Anna: My mom co-owned a horse for a little
while.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.149
A lot of people go in on one together so that
you don't have to pay all of the expenses,

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:07.390
especially with any vet calls that might happen.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.440
My mom co-owned a horse for a little while.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.950
A lot of people go in on one together so that
you don't have to pay all of the expenses,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.980
especially with any vet calls that might happen.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.060
Vanessa: Did you hear the word especially
or 'specially?

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.060
I hope so.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.760
Let me know in the comments, what was your
score?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.490
Did you get all five of these right?

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.070
Or maybe you got none of them right?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.250
Feel free to repeat this lesson as much as
you need.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:39.900
Today, I want to test you on 15 advanced English
vocabulary words that you'll definitely hear

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.740
in daily conversation.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.580
Not words like convivial that you'll never
hear Americans actually say.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.970
These are words that you're going to hear
in conversation, in movies, in TV shows, and

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.370
you are welcome to integrate them and add
them to your own personal vocabulary.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.390
I challenge you to test yourself.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.070
Try to guess the correct answer to each sentence.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.420
If you don't get the answer correct, no worries.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.390
Vanessa: That means that you're ready to add
a new word to your vocabulary.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.970
You can write it down, make your own sentence
with it, read your sentence out loud, and

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:17.390
enjoy yourself because adding to your vocabulary
can be fu, and also it's super useful.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.420
Let's start with the first sentence.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.550
I'm going to read you a sentence, and there
are going to be two options for you to fill

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.550
in the blank.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.530
I'll give you three seconds, and you can try
to guess what the correct answer is before

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.710
I explain it.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.710
Let's get started.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:37.890
Sentence number one is, I need to practice
English because we have to _ with the American

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.430
branch next week.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.870
Is the word collaborate or is the word decide?

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.310
We have to collaborate with the American branch.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.380
We have to decide with the American branch.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.420
Which word is the best fit for this sentence?

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.230
Vanessa: I'll give you three seconds.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.640
Three, two, one.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.180
The correct answer is collaborate.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.780
If you got this correct, congratulations.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.530
If not, I want to let you know that the word
collaborate means work together.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.510
You often use this in project situations.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.740
I have to collaborate with my classmates.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.030
We have to work together on a project, or
I have to collaborate with the marketing department

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.560
or the American branch.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.350
We're working on a project together.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.350
We have to collaborate.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.590
This is a beautiful advance word.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.170
Of course, you can simply say work together.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.170
Great.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.170
No problem.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.830
But this video is all about advanced English
expressions that are commonly used.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.920
You can say, "I have to collaborate with the
American branch."

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.400
Let's go on to sentence number two.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.320
The second sentence is, what do you think
is the _ time to go to bed?

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.900
Vanessa: What do you think is the original
time to go to bed?

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.120
What do you think is the optimum time to go
to bed?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.520
I'll give you three seconds.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.080
What do you think is the optimum time to go
to bed?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.860
The word optimum is just an advanced, beautiful
way to say best.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.080
What do you think is the best time to go to
bed?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.960
Here in this picture you can see...

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.850
This is not sponsored by this company.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.880
I just found this picture online, but this
company has decided to use the word optimum

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.570
to describe their product.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.280
When you take their product, you will get
the best sleep.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.250
You will get the optimum sleep.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.700
I hope that you can use this as an advanced
way to say best.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.270
Let's go to the next one.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.800
Sentence number three.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:37.070
When he told me about his experience growing
up during the war, I realized how _ kids are.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.810
Vanessa: I realized how resistant kids are.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.520
I realized how resilient kids are.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.050
Both of these words sound similar, so make
sure that you choose the correct what I'll

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.550
give you three seconds.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.500
Three, two, one.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.600
I realized how resilient kids are.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.290
This is a beautiful word.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.010
There's a lovely Z sound in there, resilient.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.010
Resilient.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:08.460
this means that you're able to survive even
though you have difficult circumstances.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.410
You're able to keep going and kids are the
perfect example of this.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:18.080
Even though a lot of kids grow up in a difficult
situation, they survive.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.420
They are resilient.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.620
They can adapt to those situations.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.620
All right.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.760
Let's go on to the next one.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.470
Sentence number four.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:31.580
It made me really annoyed when my dad _ at
my idea to interview the president.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:39.720
Vanessa: It made me really annoyed when my
dad scoffed at my idea to interview the president,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.460
or when he scammed at my idea to interview
the president.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.160
Which one is the best word for this situation?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.460
Three, two, one.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:57.440
It made me really annoyed when my dad scoffed
at my idea to interview the president.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.790
The word scuff is another excellent word,
and you can see by my facial expression that

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:09.640
the word scoff means you're laughing, you're
making fun of, and it's often accompanied

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.490
by this kind of puff of air.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.740
If you are scoffing at someone else, you're
kind of laughing or you think their idea is

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.860
a little stupid or silly, you're going to
make that same sound.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.510
You think you could interview the president?

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.100
That is scoffing.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.500
When you hear someone scoffing, now you know
they are indeed scoffing.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.970
Vanessa: Let's go to the next one.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:39.100
The fifth sentence is, In _ I should have
bought stock in Google.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.730
In _ I should have bought stock in Google.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:49.930
Is it in retrospect, I should have bought
stock in Google, or in honesty, I should have

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.620
bought stock in Google?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.550
Which one feels the most right to you?

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.510
I'll give you three seconds.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.630
Three, two, one.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.380
In retrospect, I should have bought stock
in Google.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:09.300
This word retrospect is actually a word that
we studied in The Fearless Fluency Club a

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.170
couple months ago.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.350
The first part of this word is retro.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.570
Retro means in the past and spect means looking.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.300
We can imagine we're looking in the past,
but there is a slight little nuance about

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.300
this word.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:30.410
Vanessa: It means we're thinking about the
past, but it means that we realized in the

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.490
past we made a bad decision.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.550
But in the past I didn't know it was a bad
decision, but now I realize in retrospect,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.280
I should have bought stock in Google.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.500
I would be really rich right now, but, you
know, I didn't do it and probably you didn't

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.500
either.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.490
In retrospect, we can learn a lot.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.120
Let's go to the next one.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120
Number six.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.240
I asked her to help me move next weekend,
but her answer was kind of _.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.870
She just said, "I don't know, maybe.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.140
We'll see."

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.950
Was her answer inundated?

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.630
Was her answer ambiguous?

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.690
Which is the best word for this situation?

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.270
Three, two, one.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.709
Her answer was ambiguous.

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:16.420
This means that it's not certain.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.430
I don't actually know what her answer is.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.790
It's not clear at all.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:26.480
Vanessa: You can see in this cool image here
that it is a little bit ambiguous.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.240
Do you see a rabbit or do you see a duck?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.040
It's ambiguous.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.040
It's not certain.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.230
It's a beautiful word.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.500
Let's go to the next one.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.270
Sentence number seven.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:43.480
Speaking only one language _ me from getting
a promotion.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.070
Speaking only one language hinders me from
getting a promotion, or speaking only one

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.710
language diverts me from getting a promotion.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.940
What's the best word for this situation?

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.600
Three, two, one.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.980
Speaking only one language hinders me from
getting a promotion and that's why I'm here

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.600
with Speak English with Vanessa to improve
my English and get a promotion.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.029
I hope it works for you.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.829
Here, this word hinders means stops or prevents.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:18.230
Vanessa: When you speak only one language,
maybe that is preventing you from getting

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:23.280
a better job, or it's preventing or hindering
you from getting a promotion.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.069
This word hinder is a beautiful way to color
your vocabulary and sound like an advanced

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.090
English speaker.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.090
Let's go to the next one.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.190
Sentence number eight.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:36.720
My ancestors came to the U.S. and tried to
_ into the general American culture.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.509
They tried to asinine into the culture.

00:17:39.509 --> 00:17:43.070
The tried to assimilate into the culture.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.370
Which word is the best?

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.889
Three, two, one.

00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:54.640
My ancestors came to the U.S. and they tried
to assimilate to the general American culture.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.669
This means they tried to fit in.

00:17:57.669 --> 00:18:01.759
They tried to be similar to the general American
culture.

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:07.500
Vanessa: This is something that was quite
common, especially in the early 1900s.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:14.120
People who came to the U.S. from Italy, like
my ancestors, or Poland or Ireland or from

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:20.480
other countries as well, they tried to fit
in or lose their native culture and tried

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:27.230
to assimilate into the general American culture,
which is why American culture nowadays is

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.390
quite diverse because no one can actually
perfectly assimilate.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:35.789
We all keep little bits of our own culture
inside of us, but this is the best word to

00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:36.789
describe this.

00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:40.929
They tried to assimilate into the general
American culture.

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:42.570
Let's go to the next one.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.570
Number nine.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:49.300
When the teenager hit my car in the parking
lot, I couldn't believe how _ he was.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.420
I couldn't believe how nonchalant he was.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.950
Vanessa: I couldn't believe how immune he
was.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.500
What is the best word for this sentence?

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.529
Three, two, one.

00:19:01.529 --> 00:19:07.899
When the teenager hit my car, I couldn't believe
how nonchalant he was.

00:19:07.899 --> 00:19:11.360
This means not caring, cool.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360
It doesn't bother him.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.360
Oh, I hit your car.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360
It's not a big deal.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.570
It's, Oh, it's all right.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.860
Don't worry about it.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860
Nonchalant.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.140
I was quite surprised when the teenager hit
my car and he didn't care.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.309
He was just nonchalant.

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:24.610
It's all right.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.679
Let's just go hang out on the beach.

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:29.679
Not exactly.

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:32.830
That's not exactly how you respond in that
situation.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.970
Let's go to the next one.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.799
Sentence number 10.

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:40.169
Last week, I was really busy and didn't get
much sleep, but last night I slept for nine

00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:41.940
glorious hours.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.720
This morning I feel _.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.269
This morning I feel rejuvenated.

00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:50.000
This morning I feel modified.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.540
Vanessa: What's the best word in this situation?

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.990
I feel, three, two, one, rejuvenated.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:02.299
Here, we're talking about alive, with energy.

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:08.270
I feel like before I was tired and now all
of a sudden I have more energy.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.490
I feel rejuvenated.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.970
What about for you?

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.070
What makes you feel rejuvenated?

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.440
Is it when you have a good chat with a friend,
or you go for a walk in the woods, or you

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.870
get a good night's sleep?

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.100
What makes you feel rejuvenated?

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.499
Let's go to the next one.

00:20:22.499 --> 00:20:23.730
Number 11.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:31.309
When he made a remark about her weight, he
was _ to the fact that she felt embarrassed.

00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:39.170
He was obvious to the fact that she felt embarrassed,
or he was oblivious to the fact that she felt

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.170
embarrassed.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.670
Vanessa: There is a slight difference between
these two words in their spelling, so make

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:49.129
sure that you choose the word correctly, especially
if you're writing it down.

00:20:49.129 --> 00:20:50.129
Don't mess up.

00:20:50.129 --> 00:20:53.600
I'll give you three, two, one seconds.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.440
The correct answer is, he was oblivious to
the fact that she felt embarrassed.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.500
This means that he had no clue.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.740
He wasn't paying attention at all.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.570
You can see in this fun image, this perfectly
describes oblivious.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.770
He's looking at his phone, he's telling someone,
"I'll see you later.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.690
Take care," and then he's about to step in
a giant hole.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.740
He is oblivious.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.519
He's not paying attention.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:19.870
This is a beautiful word to talk about someone
who just has no idea.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.460
They're just oblivious.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.830
They're not knowing what's going on.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.830
Let's go to the next one.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.179
Vanessa: Number 12.

00:21:26.179 --> 00:21:31.890
One of the worst types of bullying is to _
someone from the group.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.980
Is to fund someone from the group.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.780
Is to ostracize someone from the group.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.960
Which one of these words is the best?

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.580
I'll give you three, two, one.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:50.080
The correct answer is, one of the worst types
of bullying is to ostracize someone from the

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.080
group.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.990
This means that you push them away.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.039
You ignore them.

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:57.990
You don't let them be your friend, be part
of the group.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.669
This is something that is really harsh, especially
for teenagers because they really want to

00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:03.669
have friends and fit in.

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:05.539
This is pretty tough.

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:09.980
If you were ostracized as a kid or as a teenager,
I'm sorry.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.510
It's really a difficult situation.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.510
Number 13.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:18.320
I was going to rest inside today, but after
I saw the sunny weather, I decided to go for

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.300
a hike _ of the moment.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.879
Vanessa: What is that word there?

00:22:22.879 --> 00:22:25.659
Spur of the moment or top of the moment?

00:22:25.659 --> 00:22:28.040
Which one of those words fits the best?

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.999
I'll give you three seconds, two seconds,
one second.

00:22:30.999 --> 00:22:36.269
The answer is, I decided to go for a hike
spur of the moment.

00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:40.659
If you are in The Fearless Fluency Club this
month, you know that we have talked about

00:22:40.659 --> 00:22:42.590
this word, spur of the moment.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.640
It means spontaneously.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640
I didn't plan it.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.789
I was in fact planning to rest, but instead
I saw the weather and thought, "Hey, I'll

00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:51.649
just go outside and go for a hike.

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:53.559
I did it spur of the moment.

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:55.619
I did it spontaneously."

00:22:55.619 --> 00:22:56.750
Let's go to the next one.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.799
Number 15.

00:22:57.799 --> 00:23:03.179
Looking at your phone too much can hurt your
eyes, but if you _ your body will hurt as

00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:04.179
well.

00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:08.529
Vanessa: If you sling, your body will hurt
as well.

00:23:08.529 --> 00:23:12.299
If you slouch, your body will hurt as well.

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:13.360
Which one of these two words?

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.440
Will you choose?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.380
Three, two, one.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:25.309
The answer is, looking at your phone too much
can hurt your eyes, but if you slouch, your

00:23:25.309 --> 00:23:27.529
body will hurt as well.

00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:34.559
This action of not sitting up straight, but
slouching is a common vocabulary word these

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:39.350
days because a lot of people are starting
to feel concerned about your posture while

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.850
you're looking at your phone.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:45.779
Especially young people are looking at their
phones a lot during their body's formative,

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:49.889
so slouching can cause a lot of problems later
in life.

00:23:49.889 --> 00:23:51.470
A lot of parents say, "Don't slouch.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.470
Don't slouch.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.549
Sit up," or a teacher say that, "Hey, don't
slouch.

00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:56.549
Sit up."

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:57.889
Look at your posture right now.

00:23:57.889 --> 00:24:01.269
Are you slouching or are you sitting up?

00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:04.840
Vanessa: You can take a moment to correct
your posture and don't slouch.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.929
Let's go to the next one.

00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:07.570
Sentence number 15.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.159
This is the last one.

00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:10.159
You got this.

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:13.669
The sentence is, someone said it's going to
snow tomorrow.

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:19.259
I know it's only October, but I guess it's
_.

00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:21.659
But I guess it's plausible.

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:24.070
But I guess it's passable.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.090
Which one of these two words is the best?

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.970
Three, two, one.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.539
Well, someone said it's going to snow tomorrow.

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:35.570
It's only October, but I guess it's plausible.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.259
Plausible.

00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:39.690
Don't forget that L sound there.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.690
Plausible.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.470
This means that it's possible, but not likely.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:49.230
You can see here in this fun image that I
found, I was doing a search for the word plausible

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.749
because I wanted to show an image to you,
and this image is perfect for the word plausible.

00:24:54.749 --> 00:24:57.580
They're showing how the dinosaurs disappeared.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:02.620
Vanessa: Maybe in the science world there's
some controversy about how dinosaurs disappeared.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.620
I don't really know.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:09.460
I haven't really researched it that much,
but here is a plausible, it's possible, but

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.570
not likely situation.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.260
We have the animals on the ark.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:21.159
This is kind of a Christian idea of the animals
getting saved in the flood and they are shooting

00:25:21.159 --> 00:25:23.239
and killing the dinosaurs.

00:25:23.239 --> 00:25:25.730
Do you think this happened?

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:31.009
Very unlikely, but there's no way to prove
it, so it is plausible.

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:35.389
That is a fun way to use the word plausible.

00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:42.450
If someone tells you something that's pretty
unbelievable, but it's maybe possible, you

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.330
could say, "Well, it's plausible.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.380
Okay.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.240
It's not likely, but it's plausible."

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.419
Now, I have a challenge for you.

00:25:50.419 --> 00:25:54.679
We've talked about 15 excellent advanced English
vocabulary words.

00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:59.399
Vanessa: I want you to choose one or more
if you'd like and try to make your own sentence

00:25:59.399 --> 00:26:04.690
in the comments with this word.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.710
I have a secret to tell you.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.820
Before I became an English teacher, I had
never heard the expression phrasal verb.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:17.890
I can bet you $50 that if you went on the
street and you asked anyone in the U.S. what's

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.139
a phrasal verb, I bet that they wouldn't know.

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:26.040
I tell you this because sometimes when you
try to focus on concepts and put them into

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.309
little categories like phrasal verbs, flap
T, past perfect, present perfect, it can feel

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:35.909
really stressful and make you feel a little
more stressed about English than you need

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:36.909
to.

00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:42.299
Of course, it's great to have tools in your
metaphorical toolbox to know what those concepts

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:44.299
are, but don't let them stress you out.

00:26:44.299 --> 00:26:48.460
Vanessa: When I was living in Paris, my French
teacher was the most amazing teacher that

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.690
I've ever had, and I always try to be like
him.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.159
Let me give you an example about what he would
do.

00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:57.960
Every English speaker has a fear of the subjunctive
tense in French.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.940
For some reason, because we don't really use
it that often in English, it is just really

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.820
stressful to learn this in French.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.289
My teacher had a unique way to help us learn
this without stress.

00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:12.429
I really remember at the end of that lesson
I felt like, "Oh, it's not that bad.

00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:15.720
Why did I think that the subjunctive tense
was that bad?"

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720
This is what he did.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.590
He went around the room and he asked each
student a question.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.279
We knew that we needed to answer that question
using the subjunctive tense.

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:29.619
Vanessa: He didn't give us the rule, you need
to use it for desire, will, or wanting these

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:30.659
types of things.

00:27:30.659 --> 00:27:33.889
He just said, "Your answer needs to be in
the subjunctive tense.

00:27:33.889 --> 00:27:34.889
Here's my question."

00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:38.669
He asked me, "What do you need to do today?"

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:41.700
I said [French 00:27:39] blah, blah, blah.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.990
This is using the subjunctive tense in French.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:50.289
I didn't know the exact rule behind this yet,
but in real life, when someone asked me, "What

00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:56.399
do you need to do today," I knew I need to
use the subjunctive because I already had

00:27:56.399 --> 00:28:00.419
this real life situation where I used it in
the classroom.

00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:02.130
I hope that today's lesson will be similar.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:08.860
I hope that you'll be able to use these phrasal
verbs intuitively before I teach you a rule

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.860
about it.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.070
Vanessa: What I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you nine pairs of sentences and I

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:19.039
want you to guess should you use the phrasal
verb or should you use the simple verb?

00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:20.799
Let's take a look at a quick example.

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:25.200
Here we have two verbs, try and try out.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.269
Try out is the phrasal verb and try is the
simple verb.

00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:31.070
Here are two sentences.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:36.230
I need to _ the cake before I buy it.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.700
I need to _ the program before I buy it.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.299
The only difference here is the cake or the
program.

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:50.999
Which one is best with just try, the simple
verb try, and which one's best with the phrasal

00:28:50.999 --> 00:28:52.640
verb, try out?

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.659
Think about it for a moment.

00:28:54.659 --> 00:29:03.320
Did you say, "I need to try the cake before
I buy it and I need to try out the program

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320
before I buy it?"

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.759
Vanessa: ... and I need to try out the program
before I buy it.

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:06.759
If you said this, you are correct.

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:12.779
Did you know that we use "try out" to test
some kind of program or experience?

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:17.859
Maybe you didn't know that specific rule,
but "try out" just intuitively felt right

00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:18.900
with the word program.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.070
That's what I want you to do, I want you to
look inside your heart and guess the best

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.659
answer for these next pairs of sentences.

00:29:25.659 --> 00:29:29.899
Afterwards, I'll tell you a quick rule about
it, but hopefully in the future you'll be

00:29:29.899 --> 00:29:31.070
able to use these naturally.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.090
All right, let's go on to our first pair of
sentences.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:39.139
Vanessa: Pair number one: "brings or brings
up."

00:29:39.139 --> 00:29:44.230
Vanessa: "He always ... his wife in conversation."

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:50.059
Vanessa: "He always ... some wine to my house."

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:54.570
Vanessa: The main difference here is the end
of the sentence, of course, so take a look

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:59.840
at this and feel in your heart which one is
the most correct for each of these sentences.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.929
Did you say, "He always brings up his wife
in conversation.

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:09.460
He always brings some wine to my house"?

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.460
I hope so.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.629
That's the correct answer.

00:30:11.629 --> 00:30:19.460
We use the phrasal verb to "bring up" something
to talk about entering a topic into a conversation.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.470
That means that this man often talks about
his wife in conversation, hopefully because

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.970
he loves her so much, so he brings up his
wife in conversation.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.960
Or you could bring up politics in conversation.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.639
You are bringing up a topic in a conversation.

00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:38.960
And of course, we use the word "bring" to
physically give something to someone else.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.929
"He brings a bottle of wine to my house."

00:30:41.929 --> 00:30:46.190
Vanessa: Pair number two: "fill or fill out."

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:50.679
Vanessa: "You should ... your mind with facts."

00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:55.830
Vanessa: "You should ... the form with facts."

00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:02.479
Vanessa: The only difference is your mind
and the form.

00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:04.379
Think about this for a moment.

00:31:04.379 --> 00:31:05.960
I'll give you three seconds.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.629
Three, two, one.

00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:14.480
"You should fill your mind with facts.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.299
You should fill out the form with facts."

00:31:19.299 --> 00:31:25.450
Did you know that we use "fill out a form"
to talk about writing some information on

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.450
a form?

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:31.460
I use the simple verb "fill" in this more
metaphorical way.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:39.409
Of course, you can "fill a glass of water,"
but when you "fill your mind with facts,"

00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:42.860
your mind has a lot of factual information
in it.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.559
It is filled with facts.

00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:48.919
Vanessa: Pair number three: "found and found
out."

00:31:48.919 --> 00:31:53.059
This is the past tense of "find and find out".

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:57.690
Vanessa: "I ... how to avoid the traffic."

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.799
Vanessa: "I ... a better road to avoid traffic."

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:09.049
Vanessa: Which one of these needs the phrasal
verb, and which one of these needs the simple

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:10.049
verb?

00:32:10.049 --> 00:32:11.389
Think about it for three seconds.

00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:13.669
Three, two, one.

00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:19.639
Did you say, "I found out how to avoid the
traffic."?

00:32:19.639 --> 00:32:24.960
Did you say, "I found a better road to avoid
the traffic."?

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.679
I hope so.

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:33.200
We use "find out" to talk about solving a
problem, especially when we say "find out

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.759
how" or "find out why."

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:41.240
Those are your keywords, "how and why" when
we use "find out".

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:47.229
For a longer video about "find out" and "figure
out," you can check out this link up here,

00:32:47.229 --> 00:32:52.450
which is a video that I made about two years
ago comparing these two similar and yet different

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.450
phrasal verbs.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.350
Vanessa: Pair number four: "read and read
over."

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:05.070
Now, this pair of words here looks like "read
and read over" but the present and the past

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:08.870
tense are spelled exactly the same, they're
just pronounced differently.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:09.989
So we need the context here.

00:33:09.989 --> 00:33:11.879
Let's take a look at the sentences.

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:15.440
Vanessa: "She ... the article three times."

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.019
Vanessa: She ... the newspaper this morning."

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:24.999
Vanessa: Which one should have "read" and
which one should have "read over"?

00:33:24.999 --> 00:33:26.879
Think about it for a moment.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:28.239
Three, two, one.

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:36.899
It is best to say, "She read over the article
three times," and "She read the newspaper

00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:37.899
this morning."

00:33:37.899 --> 00:33:43.220
For this one, it's okay to say, "She read
the article three times," but if you want

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:50.340
to emphasize that she read it in detail, this
is "read over," to look at something in detail.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.739
Then you can use the phrasal verb, "read over."

00:33:52.739 --> 00:33:58.220
Vanessa: "She read over the article three
times in detail to find out everything."

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.950
Vanessa: Pair number five: "used or used up".

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:08.859
The sentences are:
Vanessa: "Dan ... the cream for his coffee?"

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:13.069
Vanessa: "Dan ... the cream for his coffee,
oh no!"

00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:16.619
Vanessa: So the only difference here is "Oh
no!"

00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:20.470
Which one evokes the feeling of, "Oh no."

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:21.679
Think about it for a moment.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.679
Three, two, one.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:31.369
Did you say, "Dan used the cream for his coffee,"
and "Dan used up the cream for his coffee,

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:32.369
oh no!"?

00:34:32.369 --> 00:34:33.369
I hope so.

00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:36.419
If Dan uses cream for his coffee, cool.

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:37.419
Okay.

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:38.419
It doesn't bother me.

00:34:38.419 --> 00:34:39.419
I don't care.

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:44.899
But if Dan uses up the cream for his coffee,
this is a problem because it means that I

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:45.899
don't get any.

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:49.030
"Use up" means to finish something completely.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:54.429
So in the morning when Dan makes his coffee,
if he uses up the cream, I might be a little

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:59.770
bit upset because then I don't get any in
my drink, so that's why I said, "Oh no!"

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:00.770
Let's go to the next one.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.530
Vanessa: Number six: "call, call on".

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.569
Let's look at the sentences.

00:35:06.569 --> 00:35:12.750
Vanessa: "If you don't listen, the teacher
will ... your parents after class."

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:19.079
Vanessa: "If you don't listen, the teacher
will ... you in class."

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:23.160
Vanessa: Which one feels the most correct
for the phrasal verb?

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.670
Three, two, one.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:34.110
Did you say, "If you don't listen, the teacher
will call your parents after class.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:38.400
If you don't listen, the teacher will call
on you in class."?

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.470
Vanessa: For me, this seems like it's a universal
truth that if you're not listening, if you're

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.010
about to fall asleep, the teacher will always
call on you.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:51.810
The teacher knows who sleepy, who is not paying
attention, and they'll say, "Vanessa, what's

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.289
number six?"

00:35:53.289 --> 00:35:54.540
And then you feel really scared.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:59.270
So when you call on someone, you ask them
to answer a question.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.630
Have you ever experienced this in school that
when you're not paying attention, the teacher

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.710
always calls on you.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:12.099
But if you call someone, "The teacher called
my parents," this means that she's making

00:36:12.099 --> 00:36:13.820
a phone call.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.059
When someone makes a phone call to your parents,
it's always a bad thing.

00:36:17.059 --> 00:36:22.859
So if you're not listening in class, the teacher
might call your parents.

00:36:22.859 --> 00:36:25.990
She's not calling on your parents, that feels
a little bit weird.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.690
She's just simply calling your parents.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.819
Vanessa: Number seven is "got and got into."

00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:34.660
The verb "got" is the past tense of "get"
here.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.520
So let's think about which one of these fits
into these sentences.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.980
Vanessa: "I ... English last year when I found
Vanessa's lessons."

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:47.559
Vanessa: "I finally ... English last year
when I found Vanessa's lessons."

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:53.160
Vanessa: The only difference here is the word
"finally."

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.210
Think about which one of these words is correct.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:59.150
Three, two, one.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:06.510
"I got into English last year when I found
Vanessa's lessons.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:13.500
I finally got English last year when I found
Vanessa's lessons."

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.490
Why did we say, "I got into English last year."?

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:21.150
That means that you started to become interested
in English when you found my lessons.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.730
Maybe that was true for you, I hope so.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:28.950
So you started to become interested in something,
but the word "get", or in the past tense of

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.339
"got", by itself has a lot of different meetings
in this sentence.

00:37:32.339 --> 00:37:34.770
It means simply understood.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.450
Maybe you've never understood another native
English speaker before and then you watched

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.390
my lessons and thought, "I can understand
her.

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:42.789
This is amazing."

00:37:42.789 --> 00:37:45.349
So you might say, "I finally got English.

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:49.140
It finally made sense to me when I found Vanessa's
lessons."

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.970
So you would say, "I finally got English when
I found Vanessa's lessons."

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.069
Vanessa: Number eight: "keep and keep on".

00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:59.109
Let's look at the sentences.

00:37:59.109 --> 00:38:03.930
Vanessa: "Make sure that you ... studying
every day."

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.590
Vanessa: "Make sure that you ... studying
every day."

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:12.430
Vanessa: Which one of these is correct?

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.900
Think about it for a moment.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:19.579
Do both of these sentences look exactly the
same to you?

00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:21.970
This is a trick question, I'm sorry.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:25.700
It's because "keep" and "keep on" have exactly
the same meaning.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.250
"Make sure that you keep studying every day.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.220
Make sure that you keep on studying every
day."

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:38.200
This is exactly the same meaning you could
say, "Keep on running, go, go, go," or "Keep

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.839
running, go, go, go."

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.720
Same meaning, no problem.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.690
You can use "keep" or "keep on" and they're
the same.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.410
Let's go to the next one and the final question.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.410
Number nine.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.390
Vanessa: Number nine: "show and show up".

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:56.710
Vanessa: "Why does she always ... us pictures
of her cats?"

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.650
Vanessa: "Why does she always ... 10 minutes
late?"

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:05.010
Vanessa: Which one is best with the simple
verb?

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.240
Which one is best with the phrasal verb?

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.030
Think about it for just a moment.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.349
Three, two, one.

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:15.650
"Why does she always show us pictures of her
cats?"

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:19.830
Probably because they're really cute and she
loves them and she wants you to love them

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.830
too.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.859
"Why does she always show up 10 minutes late?"

00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:29.770
When someone shows up, they appear, they arrive
10 minutes late.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:36.160
This is pretty rude depending on the situation,
but if it's at work, do not show up 10 minutes

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.560
late, not a good idea if you want to keep
your job.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.560
Vanessa: All right.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.560
How did you do?

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.500
Did you add the phrasal verbs to the right
sentence and the simple verbs to the right

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.500
sentence?

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.500
I hope you did.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500
I hope you learned something new.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.500
Let me know in the comments.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.160
What was your score on this test?

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.220
Vanessa: Do you feel like prepositions are
tricky?

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.619
Should it be, "I'm in the store or I'm at
the store.

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:04.029
I talked to him or I talked with him."

00:40:04.029 --> 00:40:09.809
These small words "in, at, with, to" these
are called prepositions.

00:40:09.809 --> 00:40:14.539
The reason why prepositions are so tricky
is because we can't translate them from your

00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:15.839
native language.

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:22.040
For example, in Spanish, the words "para"
and "por" both mean "for" when you translate

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:27.920
it into English, but those two words can be
used in a lot of different situations where

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.069
in English we would say "for, by, during,
along."

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:38.150
How are Spanish speakers and you supposed
to know which is the correct English preposition?

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.150
It's tricky.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:43.319
Today, we're not going to cover all the rules
for all prepositions, but instead we're going

00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:46.260
to do something, a little fun, a quiz.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:51.410
Over the next 15 questions, you're going to
review 15 different prepositions.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.180
Of course, we can't talk about every rule
for every preposition, but we're going to

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.970
talk about some of the common uses.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:02.750
Vanessa: Before we get started, I want you
to guess how many questions do you think you'll

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.049
guess correctly.

00:41:04.049 --> 00:41:09.890
Think about a number one through 15 or maybe
zero through 15, how many questions do you

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.510
think you'll get correct?

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.860
I want you to think about this number because
I have a feeling, I guess that you probably

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.640
know more about prepositions than you think
you do.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:25.000
So I hope that this lesson will help you to
realize, "I do know something about prepositions

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.280
and now I know a little bit more as well."

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.930
All right, let's get started with question
number one.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:35.390
Vanessa: Preposition sentence number one,
"Today is beautiful, let's go for a walk ... the

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.390
park."

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.400
Vanessa: "Let's go for a walk in the park."

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.150
Vanessa: "Let's go for a walk at the park."

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.349
Vanessa: Which one of these is the most common?

00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:46.440
I'll give you three seconds to guess.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.069
Three, two, one.

00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:56.029
The correct answer is, "It's beautiful today,
let's go for a walk in the park."

00:41:56.029 --> 00:42:01.980
You should use the word "in" because we're
talking about being inside or surrounded by

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.980
the park.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.730
If you say, "Let's go for a walk at the park."

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.120
We're just talking about a specific point.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.270
You might say, "Let's meet at the entrance
to the park" but here we're talking about

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.990
going for a walk in the park, we're surrounded
by the park.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.799
All right, let's go to question number two.

00:42:18.799 --> 00:42:24.559
Vanessa: Question number two, "Basketball
is enjoyable, but ... all I like baseball."

00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:28.079
Vanessa: "But about all, I like baseball."

00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:30.770
Vanessa: "But above all, I like baseball."

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:33.270
Vanessa: Which preposition is correct?

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.220
You have three seconds, two, one.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:42.740
"Basketball is enjoyable, but above all, I
like baseball."

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.940
Here we have a fixed expression.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:50.190
You might call this in grammatical terms,
a collocation "above all."

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:56.970
Here we can imagine physically above your
interests are more important, more interesting.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.520
Baseball above all is the best.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:05.660
So you could say, "I like learning English
all the time, but above all, Vanessa's lessons

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.829
are my favorite."

00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:11.710
Vanessa: Sentence number three, "I'm teaching
my son to walk ... the sidewalk."

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.609
Vanessa: "I'm teaching my son to walk by the
sidewalk."

00:43:14.609 --> 00:43:17.420
Vanessa: Or "I'm teaching my son to walk on
the sidewalk."

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.029
Vanessa: Which one is correct?

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:24.369
This is true, my son's one and a half and
I'm trying to teach him to walk the sidewalk,

00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:26.809
it's dangerous if you walk the road.

00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:30.780
All right, let's think about this in three
seconds, two, one.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:36.420
The answer is, "I'm teaching my son to walk
on the sidewalk."

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:41.440
With the word "on" we can imagine a flat surface
on the sidewalk.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.049
"Don't walk on the road, walk on the sidewalk."

00:43:45.049 --> 00:43:51.339
Vanessa: Sentence number four, "Walk ... that
tall building and you'll find downtown."

00:43:51.339 --> 00:43:52.339
This is directions.

00:43:52.339 --> 00:43:56.619
Vanessa: "Walk to that tall building and you'll
find downtown."

00:43:56.619 --> 00:44:00.440
Vanessa: Or, "Walk towards that tall building
and you will find downtown."

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.310
Vanessa: Here we can kind of imagine that
in the distance there is a tall building and

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.650
you're trying to tell your friend how to get
to downtown.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:12.510
So let's think about which preposition is
correct.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.470
Three, two, one.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:20.400
"Walk towards that tall building and you'll
find downtown."

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.900
We use the preposition "towards" to talk about
moving in a direction towards something, to

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.089
something, but you're not exactly going to
that spot.

00:44:30.089 --> 00:44:35.859
"If you want to walk to downtown from my house,
you don't need to get to that tall building,

00:44:35.859 --> 00:44:39.800
you just need to move in the direction of
that tall building."

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.910
Vanessa: Sentence number five, "I'll see you
... the party ... six o'clock."

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:47.849
Vanessa: "I'll see you by the party by six
o'clock."

00:44:47.849 --> 00:44:50.799
Vanessa: "I'll see you at the party at six
o'clock."

00:44:50.799 --> 00:44:54.740
Vanessa: Here we're going to use the same
preposition for both blanks.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.880
Think about it.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.750
Three, two, one.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.990
"I'll see you at the party at six o'clock."

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.329
Here we're talking about a specific point
in time.

00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:12.640
Remember question number one, we talked about
meeting at the entrance to the park, that's

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.640
the same thing here.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.130
"We're I'm going to meet you at the party
at six o'clock."

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.540
A specific point.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:24.339
Vanessa: Preposition sentence number six,
"I don't understand what Vanessa is talking..."

00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:27.910
Vanessa: "I don't understand what Vanessa
is talking with."

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:31.510
Vanessa: "I don't understand what Vanessa's
talking about."

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.540
Vanessa: Which one is correct?

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.170
Three, two, one.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:40.190
We have a key here to help us know what the
correct answer is.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:43.110
The key word is the word "what".

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:49.190
"I don't understand what Vanessa is talking
about."

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:55.030
If you know this fixed expression to talk
about something, you know that we talk about

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.839
something, we're not talking about a person.

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:05.760
I'm talking about prepositions, I'm talking
about the moon, I'm talking about English.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.450
What if we wanted to say, "I'm talking with..."?

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:14.010
Here, we need to use a person, but in my sentence
I'm talking about something because I used

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.010
the word what.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.660
"I'm talking with you about prepositions."

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.670
Do you see that difference here?

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.580
Vanessa: Sentence number seven, this one's
a little tricky.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.710
"We'll try to be home ... 10:00 PM, but probably
earlier."

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:32.740
You can imagine telling a babysitter this,
maybe if you're going out and the babysitter

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:39.210
is staying home and watching your kids, you
might say, "We'll try to be home by 10:00

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:41.130
PM, but probably earlier."

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:46.730
Or, "We'll try to be home at 10:00 PM, but
probably earlier."

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.089
Which one is correct?

00:46:48.089 --> 00:46:50.910
Three two, one.

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:58.330
Well, technically both of these are correct,
but the best answer here is, "I'll try to

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:00.730
be home by 10:00 PM."

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.789
Why did I choose "by"?

00:47:03.789 --> 00:47:10.369
The word "by" means that we're talking about
the latest possible time, "Try to be home

00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:11.410
by 10:00 PM..."

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:16.049
And our key here is that final part, "... but
probably earlier."

00:47:16.049 --> 00:47:21.490
I'm imagining that 10:00 PM is the latest
that I will be home, so here we need to use

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:22.849
the word "by".

00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:27.390
You might also hear in a classroom, the teacher
might say to you, "You need to have your homework

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.410
finished by the beginning of class."

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:34.119
The beginning of class is the latest possible
time.

00:47:34.119 --> 00:47:39.559
Don't finish your homework during the class,
it needs to be finished by the beginning of

00:47:39.559 --> 00:47:40.559
class.

00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:45.059
Vanessa: Preposition sentence number eight,
"After watching the tidying documentary ... I

00:47:45.059 --> 00:47:47.059
went all of my things."

00:47:47.059 --> 00:47:51.829
Vanessa: "After watching the tidying documentary,
I went into all my things."

00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:54.630
Or, "I went through all my things".

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.610
Which preposition is correct?

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.170
Three, two, one.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:05.780
"After watching the tidying documentary, I
went through all of my things."

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:12.910
You can imagine a tunnel, you're going through
the tunnel, you're surrounded by the tunnel.

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:20.640
I'm here in the sentence surrounded by my
things, clothes, kitchen things, office supplies.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:28.150
I went through my things, it was thorough,
I went through every single thing.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:33.430
It also helps if you know the fixed expression
to "go through something."

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:38.610
This is one of the best ways to really memorize
prepositions is to memorize those full fixed

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.420
phrases, to "talk about" something.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.529
To "go through" something.

00:48:43.529 --> 00:48:47.160
Vanessa: Sentence number nine, "I was in New
York ... two weeks."

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.059
Vanessa: "I was in New York since two weeks."

00:48:50.059 --> 00:48:52.299
Vanessa: "I was in New York for two weeks."

00:48:52.299 --> 00:48:54.270
Vanessa: Which one is the most correct?

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:56.830
Three, two, one.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:01.289
"I was in New York for two weeks."

00:49:01.289 --> 00:49:06.490
I know that the word "for" and "since" can
be tricky together and we use "for" when we

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:10.500
ask the question, what was the duration of
time?

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:16.740
The duration of time was two weeks, so I was
in New York for two weeks.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:23.930
Vanessa: Sentence number 10, "The cat ran
... the kitchen when he heard the can open."

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:25.670
This is true for my cats.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:30.660
When you open a can of cat food, "They run
to the kitchen."

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.869
Or, "They run into the kitchen."

00:49:33.869 --> 00:49:35.619
These are pretty similar, right?

00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:37.200
Think about it for just a moment.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.849
Three, two, one.

00:49:39.849 --> 00:49:46.480
"The cat ran into the kitchen when he heard
the can open."

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:52.539
We use the preposition "into" to talk about
a room or a building.

00:49:52.539 --> 00:49:58.470
If you want to say, "The cat ran to something",
we need to use a specific thing.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.970
"The cat ran to the bowl.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:02.640
The cat ran to me.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.690
The cat ran into the kitchen to the bowl."

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:06.690
Beautiful sentence.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:11.220
Vanessa: Sentence number 11, "Oh no, that
was the last can of cat food, I need to go

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.950
... the store to get more cat food."

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:16.859
Is it, "I need to go to the store to get more
cat food."

00:50:16.859 --> 00:50:17.859
Or.

00:50:17.859 --> 00:50:20.380
"I need to go about the store to get more
cat food."?

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.319
Which one's correct?

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.260
Three, two, one.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.240
"I need to go to the store to get more cat
food."

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.720
Immediately, my cats are going crazy.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:38.440
We use the preposition "to" for a specific
destination, "Come to my house.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.579
I'm going to the US.

00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:42.910
I need to go to the store."

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:48.019
Vanessa: Number 12, "The museum is full ... tourists
in July."

00:50:48.019 --> 00:50:52.700
Vanessa: "The museum is full of tourists in
July."

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.039
Vanessa: Or, "The museum is full for tourists
in July."

00:50:57.039 --> 00:51:02.160
Vanessa: Which one feels the most correct
to you?

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.470
Three, two, one.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:08.609
"The museum is full of tourists in July."

00:51:08.609 --> 00:51:13.400
It helps if you know this fixed expression
"full of something".

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.220
"The tree is full of monkeys.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.720
The museum is full of tourists."

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:25.170
Vanessa: Number 13, "I talked ... the client
about the problem.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:29.190
Vanessa: "I talked with the client about the
problem."

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:32.760
Vanessa: Or, "I talked to the client about
the problem."

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.019
Vanessa: Think about this for a moment.

00:51:36.019 --> 00:51:38.809
Three, two, one.

00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:43.630
"I talked with the client about the problem."

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:47.940
Or, "I talked to the client about the problem."

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:52.329
Oh, both of these can be correct grammatically
but they have slightly different meanings

00:51:52.329 --> 00:51:54.269
in a business situation.

00:51:54.269 --> 00:51:58.170
If you're talking about a friend, "I talked
with my friend, I talked to my friend."

00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:59.670
No problem, same meaning.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:03.880
But in a business situation with a client
they have a slightly different meaning.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:10.119
If you say, "I talked with the client," it
has a more friendly, approachable, kind of

00:52:10.119 --> 00:52:11.190
equal feeling.

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:16.430
Both people are speaking, "I spoke with the
client, I talked with the client."

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:21.950
If you say, "I talked to the client," in a
business situation, it kind of feels like

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:24.690
one person is doing more speaking.

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:29.619
You might say, "My boss talked to me about
being late."

00:52:29.619 --> 00:52:35.289
That means that I was late too much and he
was angry with me, he talked to me about being

00:52:35.289 --> 00:52:36.289
late.

00:52:36.289 --> 00:52:40.839
So just know that in a business situation
it's slightly different but in a casual conversation

00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:41.839
they're the same.

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:45.690
Vanessa: Number 14, "It's been raining ... Saturday."

00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:47.829
Vanessa: "It's been raining until Saturday."

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:51.720
Vanessa: "It's been raining since Saturday."

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.319
Vanessa: Three, two, one.

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:57.240
When is the start date?

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.470
When did it start raining?

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:00.470
Saturday.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.680
"It has been raining since Saturday."

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.650
This is a tricky word.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:08.750
We know the start date, Saturday.

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.260
"It has been raining since Saturday.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:15.660
I've been learning English since I was eight
years old."

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:21.140
Eight years old is the start time, "I've been
learning since I was eight years old."

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:25.671
If you'd like to learn a little bit more about
the difference between "until and since" make

00:53:25.671 --> 00:53:29.289
sure you check out this live lesson that I
did quite a while ago so that you can learn

00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:30.289
that more deeply.

00:53:30.289 --> 00:53:36.730
Vanessa: And our final preposition quiz sentence
is: "I fell asleep ... the movie."

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.650
Vanessa: "I fell asleep during the movie."

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:42.769
Vanessa: Or, "I fell asleep from the movie."

00:53:42.769 --> 00:53:45.150
Vanessa: Which one of these feels the most
correct?

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:48.190
It's the last question, you can do it.

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:49.890
Three, two, one.

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:53.140
"I fell asleep during the movie."

00:53:53.140 --> 00:54:00.260
The word "during" comes from the word "duration",
which means in the middle of the movie I fell

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.260
asleep.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.569
You've heard a lot of prepositions during
this lesson.

00:54:05.569 --> 00:54:07.349
How did you do in this quiz?

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:12.870
This was just a quick overview of 15 common
prepositions, but I have a feeling that you

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:16.589
got more correct than you thought you would
at the beginning.

00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:21.290
Vanessa: "Could I speak English?

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.119
Where what I speak English?

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:25.460
Should I speak English?"

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:29.119
"Could, would, should" help.

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:35.140
These three verbs "could, would and should"
are called modal verbs and they can be tricky

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.490
for a lot of English learners.

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.200
Are they tricky for you?

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.490
Well, I have some good news today.

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:44.960
I'd like to challenge you with a "could, would,
should" test.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.009
Are you ready?

00:54:46.009 --> 00:54:51.450
I'm going to ask you eight questions using
the different forms of "could, would and should"

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:56.390
and I want you to try your best, look into
your heart and choose the correct answer.

00:54:56.390 --> 00:55:01.809
You'll have three seconds to choose "could,
would or should" and then I'll explain hopefully

00:55:01.809 --> 00:55:04.020
clearly why that's the correct answer.

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.829
Vanessa: Number one, let's imagine that you
work for an American company and one of your

00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:13.140
coworkers tells you that she's having trouble
making friends in your country, so you want

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:16.170
to give her some polite advice.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:22.869
You say, "If you want to meet local people,
you ... go to a bar."

00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:25.519
Vanessa: "You could go to a bar."

00:55:25.519 --> 00:55:28.230
Vanessa: "You would go to a bar."

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.849
Vanessa: "You should go to a bar."

00:55:30.849 --> 00:55:34.309
Vanessa: You have three seconds to choose
the best answer.

00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:37.460
Three, two, one.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:43.349
"If you want to make friends, you could go
to a bar."

00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:48.010
We use "could" to give a polite suggestion.

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:53.299
This isn't commanding someone to do something,
we'll talk about that with "should" later.

00:55:53.299 --> 00:55:59.089
To practice this way to use "could" I want
to ask you a question, "If I visit your city,

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:01.980
where could I get a good view?

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:05.180
Sometimes it's nice to go up high and look
down on the city.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.770
So where could I go to get a good view?"

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:12.680
For example, if you came to my city, you could
go to a nearby mountain top and look down

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.680
on the city.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.640
You could go to a nearby mountain top.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:21.150
Vanessa: Number two, let's imagine that you're
visiting a new country and as you're walking

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:24.480
down the street, someone tries to steal your
phone.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:31.440
When you go back and tell the hotel receptionist
about this, she says, "Well, in the future

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.990
you ... take your phone outside, it's not
safe."

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:37.029
What's the best answer?

00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:40.700
Vanessa: "You couldn't take your phone outside."

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.609
Vanessa: "You wouldn't take your phone outside."

00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:46.259
Vanessa: Or, "You shouldn't take your phone
outside."

00:56:46.259 --> 00:56:50.259
Vanessa: Three, two, one.

00:56:50.259 --> 00:56:55.640
"In the future, you shouldn't take your phone
outside."

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.480
We use "should" to give strong advice.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.839
I hope you got this one correct because we
just briefly mentioned it during number one.

00:57:02.839 --> 00:57:06.849
In fact, this situation happened to my sister
when she was living in another country, I

00:57:06.849 --> 00:57:10.660
won't mention where, but it was her first
day in the country and she was walking down

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:15.910
the street and a lady, kind of crazy lady
came up and tried to grab her necklace from

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:16.910
around her neck.

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:23.450
It wasn't something flashy, just a little
tiny chain with a little emblem on it or something.

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:28.940
And later when she told her friends about
that experience, her friend said, "Oh yeah,

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:33.440
you shouldn't wear jewelry, especially on
that street because it's too dangerous."

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.250
Thankfully the lady didn't take her necklace,
my sister screamed and the lady ran away,

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.460
but it was a little bit frightening for her.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:44.609
So her friend's advice is really strong, "You
shouldn't wear jewelry, especially on that

00:57:44.609 --> 00:57:45.609
street."

00:57:45.609 --> 00:57:50.180
I just want to let you know that the verb
"should" is so strong that we don't often

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.020
use it for other people.

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:55.760
You don't want to tell your friends unless
it's a dangerous situation, so you don't want

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.319
to tell them, "You should eat your vegetables."

00:57:58.319 --> 00:58:01.579
It's a little bit strange, but we often use
this to talk about ourselves.

00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:02.630
If you want to give yourself-
Vanessa: We often use this to talk about ourselves.

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:06.550
If you want to give yourself advice, it's
no problem if it's strong advice.

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:08.970
You might say, "I should wake up earlier.

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:10.440
I'm sleeping too late.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.480
I should go to bed earlier because I'm having
trouble waking up.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.000
I should."

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.599
When you give yourself advice, this is perfectly
normal, and it's not too strong for someone

00:58:20.599 --> 00:58:22.289
else because it's about yourself.

00:58:22.289 --> 00:58:24.619
Vanessa: Let's go to question number three.

00:58:24.619 --> 00:58:28.140
"Mm you help me with my project?"

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.700
"Could you help me with my project?"

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.630
"Would you help me with my project?"

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:37.559
"Should you help me with my project?"

00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:39.710
Which one feels the most correct?

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:42.740
Three two, one.

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:47.680
Actually, this is a trick question because
you have two choices.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:54.359
You can say, "Could you help me with my project?"
or, "Would you help me with my project?"

00:58:54.359 --> 00:58:59.470
Both of these are equally correct, and they
both are just a polite request.

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:00.730
"Would you help me?"

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:01.869
"Could you help me?"

00:59:01.869 --> 00:59:09.920
The sentence structure is often "could," "would"
plus "you," plus a verb, plus "me."

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.279
"Could you pass me the paper?"

00:59:13.279 --> 00:59:16.720
"Would you email me when the report is ready?"

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.000
We use this all the time, so it's really natural.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.819
Vanessa: Question number four.

00:59:20.819 --> 00:59:24.440
Let's imagine that we're talking about our
childhood, and we're talking about something

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.040
that we were capable of doing as kids.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:35.210
You could say, "When I was a child, I... play
outside all day."

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.400
"I could play outside all day."

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.109
"I would play outside all day."

00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:44.259
"I should play outside all day."

00:59:44.259 --> 00:59:47.109
Which one describes a capability?

00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:50.180
Three, two, one.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:56.069
We could say, "When I was a child, I could
play outside all day."

00:59:56.069 --> 01:00:00.470
Here, we're using "can" in the past.

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:05.579
When we turn the verb "can" to conjugate it
in the past, it becomes "could."

01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:09.059
So let's take a look at this sentence in the
present and compare it with "could."

01:00:09.059 --> 01:00:12.200
"I can play outside all day."

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.019
This is describing now, the present.

01:00:15.019 --> 01:00:19.430
But if we want to talk about the past, when
you were a child, we need to change "can"

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.430
to "could."

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:23.819
"When I was a child, I could play outside
all day."

01:00:23.819 --> 01:00:27.109
It's simply talking about your ability to
do something.

01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:33.240
Vanessa: To practice this possibly new way
to use "could," I want to ask you a question.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.090
What's something that you could do when you
were younger, but you can't do now?

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:43.470
Do you see how we're comparing "could do when
you were younger" and "can't do now" with

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.759
that present?

01:00:44.759 --> 01:00:45.759
Great.

01:00:45.759 --> 01:00:50.609
You might answer this by saying, "Well, when
I was younger, I could stay up all night,

01:00:50.609 --> 01:00:51.609
but now I can't.

01:00:51.609 --> 01:00:57.079
I get tired really early," or, "When I was
younger, I could eat sweets and never gain

01:00:57.079 --> 01:00:59.140
weight, but now that's not possible."

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.799
This is a good chance to practice "could"
to talk about your ability in the past.

01:01:03.799 --> 01:01:11.730
Vanessa: Sentence number five, "When I lived
near the beach, I... swim in the water every

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:12.730
day."

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:17.359
"When I lived near the beach, I could swim
in the water every day."

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:25.050
"I would swim in the water every day," or,
"I should swim in the water every day."

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:26.670
Which one feels the most correct?

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:28.839
Three, two, one.

01:01:28.839 --> 01:01:36.910
"When I lived near the beach, I would swim
in the water every day."

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:41.609
We can use "would" to talk about "will" in
the past.

01:01:41.609 --> 01:01:46.619
This can be a little bit tricky, so my tip
for thinking about this version of "would"

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:50.599
is to think about an action that happened
regularly in the past.

01:01:50.599 --> 01:01:57.160
If I say, "When I lived at the beach, I would
swim in the water every day," this is talking

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.039
about something that habitually happened.

01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:01.329
Let's take a look at another example.

01:02:01.329 --> 01:02:05.900
"My teacher would always give us a quiz on
Friday."

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.869
It happened regularly.

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:12.250
"He wouldn't study, so he failed the class."

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:18.320
"He wouldn't regularly study," this is something
that regularly happened, "so he failed the

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320
class."

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.329
Vanessa: I want to let you know that sometimes
native speakers mix verb tenses.

01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:28.170
We might use the past simple plus a word that
means habitually.

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:32.730
So for example, you could say, "I swam in
the ocean every day."

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.250
"My teacher always gave us a quiz."

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.910
"He didn't ever study."

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:43.630
These words "every day," "always," "ever,"
they mean habitually.

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:46.019
It's something that happened regularly.

01:02:46.019 --> 01:02:50.940
So if you want to just use the past simple,
make sure that you add one of those words,

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:53.880
or you could simply say, "He wouldn't study."

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.519
"My teacher would give us a quiz."

01:02:56.519 --> 01:02:57.619
"I would swim."

01:02:57.619 --> 01:03:02.390
It already encapsulates that idea of something
that happened regularly in the past.

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:03.750
Vanessa: Question number six.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:09.020
Let's imagine that you're leaving the office
to go to lunch with your international coworkers,

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.770
and you know that it's raining outside.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:17.250
We call that sprinkling, and you see that
one of your coworkers isn't bringing her umbrella,

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:20.829
so you want to tell her something politely.

01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:25.470
You could say, "I think it's sprinkling outside.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:29.660
You... bring your umbrella or you can share
mine."

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.690
"You could probably bring your umbrella."

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:37.090
"You would probably bring your umbrella."

01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:40.349
"You should probably bring your umbrella."

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:43.920
Which one of these is the best?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.609
Vanessa: Three, two, one.

01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:49.999
"You should probably bring your umbrella."

01:03:49.999 --> 01:03:53.670
We already talked about how "should" is really
strong.

01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:58.049
So when we add the word "probably," it lessens
the intensity.

01:03:58.049 --> 01:04:01.619
We use "should probably" to give polite advice.

01:04:01.619 --> 01:04:04.289
You don't want to say, "You should bring your
umbrella."

01:04:04.289 --> 01:04:09.460
Maybe a teacher might say that to a student
or a parent might say that to a child.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:13.769
You're giving strong advice, but for your
coworkers, you want to be a little more polite.

01:04:13.769 --> 01:04:18.690
So native speakers will often add these words
to lessen the intensity and "probably" is

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:19.920
one of the most common.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.019
You could say, "We should probably make reservations
at that restaurant because it's really busy."

01:04:26.019 --> 01:04:27.019
Should probably.

01:04:27.019 --> 01:04:34.500
Vanessa: Sentence number seven, "She didn't
want to turn off her phone because she...

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.490
get an important phone call."

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:44.049
"She could get an important phone call," "She
would get an important phone call," or, "She

01:04:44.049 --> 01:04:46.109
should get an important phone call."

01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:48.690
Three, two, one.

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:55.829
"She didn't want to turn off her phone because
she could get an important phone call."

01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:59.990
We use "could" to talk about possibilities
in the future.

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:04.829
She thinks that it's pretty likely that she
will get a phone call, so she doesn't want

01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:06.190
to turn off her phone.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:10.730
"It could rain on Sunday, so let's go hiking
today."

01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:16.359
It's a possibility that on Sunday, it could
rain, so let's enjoy the outdoors today while

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:17.519
it's still sunny.

01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:19.109
I have an important note.

01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:24.250
You can substitute the word "might" in this
sentence, and it has the exact same meaning.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.150
Let's take a look at those two sentences again.

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:29.210
"She could get an important phone call."

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:31.559
"She might get an important phone call."

01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:34.079
"It could rain on Sunday."

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:36.740
"It might rain on Sunday."

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.069
You've got two choices and both of them are
correct.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.710
Vanessa: Sentence number eight.

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:42.170
This is the final sentence.

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:48.799
"If I didn't have air conditioning in my house,
it... be very hot."

01:05:48.799 --> 01:05:52.319
"It could be very hot."

01:05:52.319 --> 01:05:55.220
"It would be very hot."

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.069
"It should be very hot."

01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:59.869
Which one feels the most correct?

01:05:59.869 --> 01:06:02.559
Three, two, one.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:10.329
"If I didn't have air conditioning in my house,
it would be very hot."

01:06:10.329 --> 01:06:14.640
We often use "would" to talk about hypothetical
situations.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.900
These are imaginary things.

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.140
It's not real.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.980
It's not happening right now.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.980
It's hypothetical.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.530
Sometimes these are impossible situations.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:27.730
"If I were a cat, I would sleep a lot."

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:30.740
It's not possible for me to become a cat.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.210
This is hypothetical.

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:34.810
It's imaginary, so we need to use "would."

01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:42.039
"I would sleep a lot," or you can use "would"
for hypothetical situations that are not impossible,

01:06:42.039 --> 01:06:46.140
but they're just not happening right now,
and that's what our sample sentence at the

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.140
beginning was.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:51.650
"If I didn't have AC, it would be very hot."

01:06:51.650 --> 01:07:00.079
"The AC might break, and then I wouldn't have
air conditioning, and it would be really hot."

01:07:00.079 --> 01:07:02.480
So here, this is hypothetical.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.250
It's imaginary because it's not happening
right now, but it's still possible.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.089
It could happen in the future.

01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:09.670
So we need to use "would."

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:11.400
It would be very hot.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.460
Vanessa: How did you do on this quiz?

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.720
Let me know in the comments what your score
was.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.630
But before we go, let's review all of these
ways to use "could," "would," and "should."

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.789
Could.

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.680
A suggestion, "You could go to a bar."

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.759
A polite request, "Could you help me?"

01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:34.900
"Can" in the past, "When I was a child, I
could play outside all day."

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.359
A possibility in the future, "It could rain
tomorrow."

01:07:38.359 --> 01:07:40.210
Would.

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:43.410
A polite request, "Would you help me?"

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:49.029
"Will" in the past, "When I lived near the
beach, I would swim every day."

01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:56.490
A hypothetical situation, "If I ate fast-food
every day, I would gain weight."

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:57.860
Should.

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.089
Strong advice, "I should wake up earlier."

01:08:01.089 --> 01:08:04.950
Polite advice, "You should probably call him."

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:07.310
Now, I have a challenge for you.

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:08.310
In the comments.

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:12.819
Tell me, if I visited your city, where could
I go to get a good view?

01:08:12.819 --> 01:08:20.739
Give me a polite suggestion with "could,"
or you could use another modal verb to practice

01:08:20.739 --> 01:08:21.739
them.

01:08:21.739 --> 01:08:29.589
Vanessa: Today, we're going to talk about
15 advanced vocabulary words that you'll definitely

01:08:29.589 --> 01:08:31.859
hear in daily conversation.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:36.520
If you enjoyed my first advanced vocabulary
quiz, you can watch it up here.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.230
If you haven't enjoyed it yet, watch out because
you might see some of these words in this

01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:42.770
quiz as well.

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:44.260
I challenge you to test yourself.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.310
If there's a word that you don't know, write
it down.

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.250
Try to make your own sentence with it.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:49.250
Read it out loud.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.690
Try to repeat it so that it sticks in your
memory.

01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:55.160
You'll have three seconds to guess each answer
before I explain.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.319
Let's get started.

01:08:56.319 --> 01:09:02.290
Vanessa: Number one, "I don't know why it's
taking so long to... the house across the

01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:03.290
street."

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:08.120
"I don't know why it's taking so long to renovate
the house across the street."

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:13.489
"I don't know why it's taking so long to relegate
the house across the street."

01:09:13.489 --> 01:09:15.029
Which one is the correct answer?

01:09:15.029 --> 01:09:17.359
You have three seconds.

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:18.529
Two, one.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:26.130
The correct answer is, "I don't know why it's
taking so long to renovate the house across

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.130
the street."

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.450
This is a true story.

01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:33.389
The house across the street has been getting
renovated for minimum two years.

01:09:33.389 --> 01:09:36.549
Renovate means that they're fixing it up.

01:09:36.549 --> 01:09:37.819
There's already a house.

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:41.089
They're not building a new house, but they've
repainted it.

01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:43.089
They put a new porch on it.

01:09:43.089 --> 01:09:44.710
They painted it again.

01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:46.779
They fixed up some of the outside of it.

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:48.609
They renovated the house.

01:09:48.609 --> 01:09:52.949
We usually use this word in association with
buildings or houses.

01:09:52.949 --> 01:09:54.510
That's most common way that you'll see it.

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:59.389
Vanessa: Number two, "The worst bosses will...
everything that you do."

01:09:59.389 --> 01:10:07.420
"The worst bosses will subjugate everything
that you do," or, "The worst bosses will scrutinize

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:11.930
everything that you do?"

01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:15.100
Which one is the correct answer?

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.100
Three, two, one.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.920
"The worst bosses will scrutinize everything
that you do."

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.880
This beautiful word "scrutinize" means to
look carefully at something, but it's not

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.929
just looking carefully.

01:10:27.929 --> 01:10:33.570
It's a good idea to look carefully at what
your employees are doing, but this often means

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:35.210
critically or negatively.

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:36.620
They're scrutinizing.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.840
They're picking apart every little detail
of what you do.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.010
If you've had a boss like this, you know how
annoying it is.

01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:46.820
The worst bosses scrutinize every little thing.

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.719
They don't trust their employees at all.

01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:50.210
They scrutinize their employees.

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:56.440
Vanessa: Number three, "Have you ever had
a... friend who just won't go home even though

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.620
you've already done the dishes and brushed
your teeth for bed?"

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.510
"Have you ever had a chatty friend who just
won't go home?"

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:08.530
"Have you ever had a clingy friend who just
won't go home?"

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.969
Which is the best word, chatty, or clingy?

01:11:11.969 --> 01:11:14.040
Three, two, one.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:20.640
"Have you ever had a clingy friend who just
won't go home no matter what you do?"

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:27.590
Clingy is a beautiful adjective, and it means
stuck like glue, usually in a negative way.

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:31.139
When we're talking about a person, it means
that you want them to go away, but they just

01:11:31.139 --> 01:11:32.470
won't go away.

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:35.889
So we could say that she is a clingy person.

01:11:35.889 --> 01:11:36.889
She's always with you.

01:11:36.889 --> 01:11:37.889
"How are you doing?

01:11:37.889 --> 01:11:38.889
What are you doing?

01:11:38.889 --> 01:11:39.889
Can I get together?

01:11:39.889 --> 01:11:40.889
Can I come to your house today?"

01:11:40.889 --> 01:11:41.889
Then, she won't leave.

01:11:41.889 --> 01:11:42.889
She's clingy.

01:11:42.889 --> 01:11:45.909
We could also talk about items being clingy.

01:11:45.909 --> 01:11:49.840
Maybe the skirt was clinging to her tights.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840
It was a clingy skirt.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.660
It's sticky, and it's annoying when it's a
skirt, but it's not always a negative thing.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:01.869
Maybe the cling wrap or we call this sometimes
plastic wrap is clingy.

01:12:01.869 --> 01:12:04.420
It sticks to the bowl, and that's exactly
what you want.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.420
So it means sticking.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:11.909
Vanessa: Number four, "When someone is driving
poorly, I wonder if honking will... the problem

01:12:11.909 --> 01:12:13.380
or help."

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:17.410
"I wonder if honking will exacerbate the problem
or help."

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:20.980
"I wonder if honking will examine the problem
or help."

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:24.739
I'll give you three seconds.

01:12:24.739 --> 01:12:27.000
Three, two, one.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.240
We have a clue in this sentence because we
have the word "or help."

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.340
We know that the keyword we're looking for
is the opposite of help.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:40.010
If you're taking an English exam, this is
great to look for these keywords.

01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:44.420
We have our word that we're going to talk
about in just a second "or help," so it needs

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.560
to be the opposite of help.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:53.969
"Sometimes when I see poor driving, I wonder
if honking my horn will exacerbate the problem

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:55.250
or help."

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:57.429
Can you guess what the word exacerbate means?

01:12:57.429 --> 01:13:00.070
Vanessa: It means make it worse.

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:01.780
It's not helping.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:07.199
Sometimes when someone cuts in front of me
and I honk my horn, I wonder if they will

01:13:07.199 --> 01:13:13.659
drive correctly or if it will just scare them,
and all of a sudden, they'll drive even worse.

01:13:13.659 --> 01:13:15.220
So sometimes I wonder this to myself.

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.940
It happened last week that someone cut in
front of me, and I honked my horn.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.590
They got in the correct lane, and it was fine.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:28.711
But sometimes I'm worried that when I honk
my horn, it will exacerbate the problem, make

01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:33.969
it worse because that person will just be
surprised and then veer off the road.

01:13:33.969 --> 01:13:38.010
Vanessa: Number five, "I'm usually... when
I walk alone at night."

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:44.900
"I'm usually wary when I walk alone at night,"
or, "I'm usually wiry when I walk alone at

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.900
night?"

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.800
There's only one difference between these
two words and that's the vowel.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.560
Which one is it?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.630
Three, two, one.

01:13:52.630 --> 01:14:00.880
"I'm usually wary when I walk alone at night,"
and this just means careful, cautious.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.340
I'm usually wary.

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.380
I look around me.

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.400
I try to stay alert because I want to stay
safe.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:12.800
I'm usually wary, cautious of my surroundings
when I walk alone at night.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.449
Make sure that you pronounce this word correctly,
"Wary."

01:14:16.449 --> 01:14:17.980
It sounds like "wear."

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.469
"I'm wearing clothes."

01:14:19.469 --> 01:14:22.270
"Wear," and then you just add E at the end.

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:23.270
"Wary."

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:26.570
Vanessa: If you're in the Fearless Fluency
Club, you already know this word because we

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:27.730
talked about it a couple of months ago.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:31.719
If you're not in the Fearless Fluency Club,
you can click up here to learn more with me

01:14:31.719 --> 01:14:35.659
every month and learn great vocabulary expressions
like the ones in this lesson.

01:14:35.659 --> 01:14:41.469
Vanessa: Number six, "I was surprised that
she was... about doing the dishes because

01:14:41.469 --> 01:14:45.020
she seemed so put together in her life."

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:49.700
"I was surprised that she was... about the
dishes."

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:53.989
"I was surprised that she was testy about
doing the dishes."

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:58.880
"I was surprised that she was negligent about
doing the dishes."

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:04.020
In this sentence, maybe you don't know what
put together meets.

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:08.330
That's going to be a key element here, but
we can imagine in our heads something that

01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:09.730
is put together.

01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:14.240
When you have a puzzle and it's put together,
it means it's completed.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.240
It's finished.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.679
It looks nice.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:22.239
So we can piece together the rest of that
sentence to guess what our keyword is here.

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:25.469
Let me tell you in three, two, one.

01:15:25.469 --> 01:15:31.760
"I was surprised she was negligent about doing
the dishes."

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.760
Negligent.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.840
What does this word sound like?

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.260
Do you know the word neglect?

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.630
This means that you're forgetting something.

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:42.500
If you were neglected as a child.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.219
This means that your parents didn't pay attention
to you.

01:15:45.219 --> 01:15:46.300
They forgot you.

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.429
They ignored you.

01:15:47.429 --> 01:15:53.170
Vanessa: We can imagine that for the dishes
that she was negligent about the dishes.

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:58.100
The word "negligent" means that you often
forget important tasks.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:01.239
In this situation, we have someone who is
put together.

01:16:01.239 --> 01:16:02.239
They're organized.

01:16:02.239 --> 01:16:05.070
It seems like they always know what's going
on.

01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:08.040
They're never confused, or worried, or uncertain.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.290
They are put together, but surprisingly, she
is negligent about the dishes.

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:14.900
She has tons of dishes in her sink.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.960
We can say that she often forgets important
tasks.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960
She is negligent.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.980
Vanessa: Number seven, "We rented a... house
in the English countryside."

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:31.750
"We rented up quaint house in the English
countryside," or, "We rented a tactful house

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:32.960
in the English countryside?"

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.460
Which of these words feels the most correct?

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.670
I'll give you three seconds.

01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:39.960
Three, two, one.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.610
"We rented a quaint house in the English countryside."

01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:53.270
The word "quaint" means cute in an old-fashioned
way, so it makes us think about simple times

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:54.860
a long time ago.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.550
Maybe our grandparents or hundreds and hundreds
of years ago.

01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:01.030
This beautiful, cute, little house.

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:03.830
This is something that seems typical in the
English countryside.

01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:05.270
There are quaint houses.

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:09.980
This is a stereotype, but you can use that
word "quaint" to talk about somewhere that

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.980
you went on vacation.

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.520
"Oh, I love this little village.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.909
It's so quaint.

01:17:13.909 --> 01:17:14.909
It's cute."

01:17:14.909 --> 01:17:20.520
Vanessa: Number eight, "I often wish that
architecture in the US was more... pleasing."

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:27.280
"I often wish that architecture in the US
was more discreetly pleasing," or, "I often

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.680
wish that architecture in the US was more
aesthetically pleasing?"

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.810
Which of these two words is correct?

01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:33.810
Three, two, one.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:42.310
The answer is, "I often wish that architecture
in the US was more aesthetically pleasing."

01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:45.310
Aesthetically means something to do with a
beauty.

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:51.300
"Oh, it's so aesthetically pleasing to see
quaint old houses," or if you've ever visited

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:56.159
Europe and you've seen those beautiful buildings
that have existed for hundreds of years, it

01:17:56.159 --> 01:17:58.040
is aesthetically pleasing.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.850
That means it's pleasing to your eyes.

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:01.290
It looks beautiful.

01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:05.070
"All those colors together in your dress are
so aesthetically pleasing."

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:09.170
Vanessa: We often use those two words together
as "aesthetically pleasing."

01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:14.700
But on the other hand, architecture in the
US isn't really known for being aesthetically

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.700
pleasing.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:20.510
Unless you go to some older areas of New York,
most places in the US just look like this.

01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:23.360
Just some big box stores with big parking
lots.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:29.690
Some downtown areas are cute, but in general,
architecture in the US is not so aesthetically

01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:30.949
pleasing, and I wish it was.

01:18:30.949 --> 01:18:31.949
Vanessa: Number nine.

01:18:31.949 --> 01:18:33.410
I'm sure this is not you.

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:38.179
"Sometimes people can be rude online because
it's easy to be..."

01:18:38.179 --> 01:18:44.389
"Sometimes people can be rude online because
it's easy to be anonymous," or, "Sometimes

01:18:44.389 --> 01:18:48.440
people can be rude online because it's easy
to be assimilated?"

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.270
Which of these two words is correct?

01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:53.270
Three, two, one.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:59.510
Sometimes, unfortunately, people can be rude
online because it's easy to be anonymous.

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:01.130
Anonymous.

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:04.510
This means that your identity is hidden.

01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:08.159
Maybe you just have a screen name, nobody
knows who you are.

01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:11.199
You can say whatever you want, so it's easy
to be rude online.

01:19:11.199 --> 01:19:15.670
Did you recognize this word "assimilated"
from the first vocabulary test?

01:19:15.670 --> 01:19:16.670
I hope so.

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:17.820
If not, make sure you go watch it.

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:23.080
Vanessa: Number 10, "Do you think that social
media... content that you see?"

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:28.740
"Do you think that social media censors content
that you see?" or, "Do you think that social

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.140
media subtracts content that you see?"

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.100
Which one is correct?

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.560
Three, two, one.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.429
"Do you think that social media censors content
that you see?"

01:19:40.429 --> 01:19:46.610
The word "sensor" means hide something that's
unacceptable.

01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:54.780
Maybe for a music album, they might say, "Censored,"
or, "Explicit," and this helps parents to

01:19:54.780 --> 01:20:00.199
know, "Uh, I don't want my five-year-old to
listen to this music because there is something

01:20:00.199 --> 01:20:02.190
in here that needs to be blocked.

01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:08.449
But when it comes to social media, maybe the
people who run social media are blocking certain

01:20:08.449 --> 01:20:09.830
things so that we don't see it.

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:13.760
This is a controversial opinion, and I don't
really know what I think about it.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.550
I don't really think much about it often,
but I want to know for you.

01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:22.239
Do you think that social media censors the
content that we see?

01:20:22.239 --> 01:20:25.030
Let me know on the comments below and use
the word "sensor."

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:31.280
Vanessa: Number 11, "The mother gave an...
sigh when her son got in trouble at school

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280
again."

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:36.990
"The mother gave an angelic sigh when her
son got in trouble at school again," or, "The

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:41.949
mother gave an exasperated sigh when her son
got in trouble at school again?"

01:20:41.949 --> 01:20:44.960
Is it angelic or exasperated?

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.739
Three, two, one.

01:20:48.739 --> 01:20:56.900
"The mother gave an exasperated, ugh, sigh
when her son got in trouble at school again."

01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:58.570
Does this word sound familiar?

01:20:58.570 --> 01:21:02.349
Does it sound like a word we talked about
previously?

01:21:02.349 --> 01:21:03.610
Exacerbate.

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:06.139
Oh, it's not the same word.

01:21:06.139 --> 01:21:09.020
One word has a B, exacerbate.

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:10.420
This means to make something worse.

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:16.760
"If I honk my horn, will it exacerbate the
problem?" or in our sample sentence here,

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.170
we have a mother who's frustrated.

01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:22.860
That's what the word "exasperate" with a P
means, frustrated.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:27.659
"Oh, son, why are you getting in trouble at
school again?"

01:21:27.659 --> 01:21:28.920
Exasperated.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.170
"Ah."

01:21:30.170 --> 01:21:36.370
The word "exasperate" means to breathe out,
so we can imagine the mother going, "Ugh,

01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:39.190
why are you in trouble again?

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:40.190
Ah."

01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:41.190
She's exasperated.

01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:42.480
She's blowing air out.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480
She's frustrated.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:49.280
Vanessa: Number 12, "Even though he tries
to be... he still can't pay his bills."

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.190
"Even though he tries to be fair, he still
can't pay his bills," or, "Even though he

01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:58.760
tries to be frugal, he still can't pay his
bills?"

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.750
Which one of these two F words is correct?

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.590
Fair or frugal?

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:05.159
Three, two, one.

01:22:05.159 --> 01:22:10.300
"Even though he tries to be frugal, he still
can't pay his bills."

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.550
The word "frugal" means careful with your
money.

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:16.639
It's generally a positive thing.

01:22:16.639 --> 01:22:20.210
If you want to use it in a negative way, you
can say stingy.

01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:22.469
This means that he never gives money to other
people.

01:22:22.469 --> 01:22:23.960
He never helps other people.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.610
He just uses his money for himself.

01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:30.640
Vanessa: But if you want to say it in a positive
way, he's just careful about spending his

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640
money.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.480
He wants to make sure that it goes to the
correct places, to the best people.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.340
You can say frugal.

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:40.500
This is a term that has often been used to
talk about me.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.520
I'm a frugal person.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.860
That means that I'm careful with my money.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:49.380
If I give money to someone else, I just want
to make sure that it's used in the way that

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.750
they say it will be used.

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:55.880
I don't have problems donating, but I just
want to make sure that it's in the best way,

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.720
so I'm careful with my money.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720
I'm frugal.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:04.790
Vanessa: Number 13, "I could see the... anger
on his face by looking at his eyes."

01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:11.520
"I could see the subtle anger on his face
by looking at his eyes," or, "I could see

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.679
this sappy anger on his face by looking at
his eyes?"

01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:17.849
Is it subtle or sappy?

01:23:17.849 --> 01:23:20.400
Three, two, one.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.780
"I could see the subtle anger on his face
by looking at his eyes."

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:30.340
The word "subtle" means not obvious.

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.400
Maybe it's a little bit hidden.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.570
You have to look carefully at his eyes to
see his anger.

01:23:35.570 --> 01:23:37.460
It's subtle.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:40.310
Do you notice something strange about the
pronunciation of this word?

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:46.170
There is a B, but it sounds like a D, "subtle,
subtle."

01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:50.400
If you want some more information about how
to pronounce the word "subtle," I made a video

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.420
about some of the most difficult words to
pronounce up here, and one of those words

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.530
is the word "subtle."

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.630
So click on that video so that you can get
some more details about its pronunciation.

01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:05.179
Vanessa: Number 14, "My baby is the cutest
baby in the whole world, but of course, I'm..."

01:24:05.179 --> 01:24:07.730
"But of course I'm biased?"

01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:10.290
"But of course, I'm biased?"

01:24:10.290 --> 01:24:13.170
Which of these B words is the correct word?

01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:20.239
Well, we could say in three, two, one, "My
baby is the cutest baby in the whole world,

01:24:20.239 --> 01:24:22.840
but I guess I'm biased."

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.420
Biased.

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.590
The word "bias" has a specific meaning, and
in fact, we use this word a lot in daily conversation.

01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:36.469
It means that you have a previous notion that
affects how you feel about other things.

01:24:36.469 --> 01:24:42.840
My baby is my child, so I'm going to have
a different opinion than someone who doesn't

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.550
know my child.

01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:48.960
Of course, all of my feelings about my child
are going to be biased.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.900
They're going to be affected by some previous
idea.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:56.000
Vanessa: I want to take a look at a quick
cartoon so that you can get another example

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.679
for the word "bias."

01:24:57.679 --> 01:25:02.330
Here we see a courtroom, and there is a lady
who's being accused of being a witch.

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:05.570
She says, "It makes no difference, what I
say.

01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:08.230
You've already decided that I'm guilty."

01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:11.790
This man had a previous notion that she is
a witch.

01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:12.790
She's guilty.

01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:14.630
It doesn't matter what she says.

01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:20.440
He's going to continue to think that she's
guilty, and the man here, he says something

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.050
that reaffirms his belief.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.389
"Ugh, gasp.

01:25:23.389 --> 01:25:25.420
Witches can read minds.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.310
She is a witch."

01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:31.520
He's just reaffirming what he already thinks,
which also affirms what she thinks.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.400
Here, this man is biased.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.750
He has a previous notion that's affecting
how he's currently behaving.

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:38.330
Vanessa: Number 15, our final question.

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:42.110
This is a question that I often get a lot
actually.

01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:45.330
"How did you learn how to teach?"

01:25:45.330 --> 01:25:48.090
I might say, "It's just...

01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:49.110
I guess."

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:55.590
"It's just intuitive, I guess," or, "It's
just oblivious, I guess?"

01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:59.300
Which one of these two words is correct, intuitive
or oblivious?

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.639
Three, two, one.

01:26:01.639 --> 01:26:05.130
"How did you learn how to teach, Vanessa?"

01:26:05.130 --> 01:26:08.489
"Well, it's just intuitive, I guess."

01:26:08.489 --> 01:26:12.130
Intuitive means that it came naturally for
me.

01:26:12.130 --> 01:26:15.260
It's something that was already within me
and it came out.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:20.670
This is just partially true because I also
did try to channel some good teachers that

01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:24.490
I've had and tried to emulate them, but we
can say here it's intuitive.

01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:26.650
It came from within me.

01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:30.420
Well, what about that other word, oblivious?

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.272
Do you recognize this word from the first
vocabulary test?

01:26:32.272 --> 01:26:33.390
I hope so.

01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:36.570
If not, make sure you check out that video.

01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:38.630
Oblivious and intuitive or not the same thing.

01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:39.630
We could say that.

01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:42.800
"Well, I guess my teaching was just intuitive.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.440
I just knew it within my mind without having
to study."

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.290
Vanessa: How did you do on this test?

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.300
Let me know in the comments.

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.650
What was your final score?

01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:52.690
Also, I have a challenge for you.

01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:56.440
Try to make a sentence with one of these new
vocabulary words.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.530
Use it in a sentence correctly and read it
out loud so that you can test your speaking

01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:01.530
muscles, and also, try to ingrain it in your
memory as easily as...

01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:04.000
Vanessa: Your speaking muscles and also try
to ingrain it in your memory as easily as

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.540
possible.

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:11.440
Vanessa: Today, I have a fun grammar test
for you.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440
Fun?

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440
Grammar?

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440
Test?

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440
Is it possible?

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.900
Yes, it's definitely possible.

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:17.900
Just watch it and see.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.989
Vanessa: In this lesson, you'll learn seven
common English grammar mistakes and how to

01:27:21.989 --> 01:27:27.130
fix them, but the trick is you have to guess
what the mistake is.

01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:28.130
Fun.

01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:33.949
I'm going to show you seven sentences and
you need to find one change in each sentence.

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:40.480
Maybe that's taking something out, maybe that's
adding something, maybe it's exchanging something.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.349
Let's take a look at a quick example.

01:27:42.349 --> 01:27:44.760
This sentence, I love dog.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.369
There's one mistake here, can you guess what
it is?

01:27:47.369 --> 01:27:50.699
What do we need to change to make this beautifully
correct?

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:54.330
Well, we need to say I love dogs.

01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:57.540
You need to add an S at the end.

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:02.330
This is a pretty simple example, so are you
ready for some more advanced grammar sentences?

01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:03.330
Let's do it.

01:28:03.330 --> 01:28:07.400
Vanessa: Let's imagine that we're in a coffee
shop together, drinking some coffee.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.860
Well, maybe that's not such a good idea because
if I had a cup of coffee, I would be running

01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:15.210
around the coffee shop nonstop.

01:28:15.210 --> 01:28:16.409
So how about this?

01:28:16.409 --> 01:28:20.460
I'm drinking some tea, you're drinking some
coffee and we're having a lovely conversation

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:24.770
together and you say to me, "So, how's it
been going lately?"

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:30.300
And I say, sentence number one, "I bought
the new Ferrari yesterday."

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.420
Oh, what's one thing that you can change in
this sentence to make it correct?

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.880
This sentence is not correct.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.260
There's something that's wrong with this sentence.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:40.260
Can you guess?

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:42.130
I'll give you three seconds.

01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:45.230
Three, two, one.

01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:51.290
Vanessa: I bought a new Ferrari yesterday.

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:55.380
You have this image in your head of us sitting
in the coffee shop.

01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.850
Do you think that we're looking at the car
right now?

01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:02.340
No, we're just kind of imagining this car.

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.540
It's not something specific, it's something
unknown.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:10.951
So we need to use A. Maybe after we have our
drinks, we go out to the parking lot and I

01:29:10.951 --> 01:29:14.860
say, "This is the new Ferrari that I bought."

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.680
This is the new Ferrari.

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.599
We're looking at it, we know which one it
is, it's right there, so we need to use the

01:29:22.599 --> 01:29:27.070
to talk about something known and A for something
that's less known.

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:29.170
Vanessa: Test sentence number two.

01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:33.739
I wanted a Ferrari because it's too fast.

01:29:33.739 --> 01:29:39.040
I wanted a Ferrari because it's too fast.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.119
What's wrong in this sentence?

01:29:41.119 --> 01:29:45.639
Three, two, one.

01:29:45.639 --> 01:29:52.219
I wanted a Ferrari because it's really fast.

01:29:52.219 --> 01:29:56.100
We only use too in negative situations.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.830
The coffee is too hot, I can't drink it.

01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:03.190
I'm too tired, I can't study.

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:08.179
Maybe I could have said, "My old car was too
slow."

01:30:08.179 --> 01:30:11.949
You can see here that in all of these situations,
there's something negative.

01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:13.510
The coffee's too hot.

01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:14.510
I'm too tired.

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:16.001
The car is too slow.

01:30:16.001 --> 01:30:21.020
There's a problem in all of these sentences,
so I probably want to fix it.

01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:27.010
And in this sentence with the Ferrari, I think
that the Ferrari is really fast, so that's

01:30:27.010 --> 01:30:28.010
why I want it.

01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:33.980
If you're curious about some differences between
too and so, I made a live lesson about this

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:37.310
a long time ago, about two years ago, and
you can watch that video up here.

01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:39.239
Vanessa: All right, sentence number three.

01:30:39.239 --> 01:30:47.099
When I bought the car, it costs $300,000.

01:30:47.099 --> 01:30:52.420
When I bought the car, it costs $300,000.

01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.239
It's a lot of money.

01:30:54.239 --> 01:30:55.510
All right.

01:30:55.510 --> 01:31:00.889
What is one thing that you can do to change
in this sentence to make it correct?

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:04.860
Three two, one.

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:14.460
When I bought the car, notice this is the
past tense, bought the car, it costs?

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:20.520
This is the present tense, we need to say
it cost $300,000.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:27.159
The word cost is an irregular verb and often,
these irregular verbs trip up or trick English

01:31:27.159 --> 01:31:31.310
learners, so we need to make sure that we
use the proper past tense.

01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:33.989
It cost $300,000.

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:41.139
Vanessa: Sentence number four, maybe after
I told you how much the car cost, you say,

01:31:41.139 --> 01:31:43.520
"Huh, Vanessa, that's so much money.

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:45.460
Why would you do something like that?"

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:53.540
And I say, "Well, I think I'm going eating
rice and beans for a whole year."

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:58.119
I think I'm going eating rice and beans for
a whole year.

01:31:58.119 --> 01:32:04.619
This means, nothing fancy, nothing special,
only rice and beans because I spent all my

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.680
money on the car.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.040
What's the problem with this sentence?

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:13.300
Three, two, one.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:20.540
I think I'm going to eat rice and beans for
a whole year.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:26.159
Often, English learners have problems with
ING and to.

01:32:26.159 --> 01:32:31.409
It depends on a lot of different factors,
but specifically, for the verb going, when

01:32:31.409 --> 01:32:33.989
we're talking about this in the future.

01:32:33.989 --> 01:32:38.000
I'm going to eat rice and beans.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.360
I'm going to study with Vanessa.

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.610
I'm going to sleep soon.

01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:48.250
Well, we need to use to plus an unconjugated
verb.

01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:49.699
I'm going to study.

01:32:49.699 --> 01:32:51.080
I'm going to eat.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.080
I'm going to sleep.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.080
Great.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.360
All right, let's go to the next one.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.550
Vanessa: Number five.

01:32:55.550 --> 01:33:01.000
For my whole life, I always dreamed of owning
a Ferrari.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.630
For my whole life, I always dreamed of owning
a Ferrari.

01:33:06.630 --> 01:33:08.280
What's the problem in this sentence?

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.280
Can you guess?

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.599
Do we need to add something?

01:33:11.599 --> 01:33:12.599
Take something away?

01:33:12.599 --> 01:33:13.659
Switch something?

01:33:13.659 --> 01:33:15.850
I'll give you three seconds.

01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:19.719
Three, two, one.

01:33:19.719 --> 01:33:26.690
For my whole life, I had always dreamed of
owning a Ferrari.

01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:30.650
Why did we add had here?

01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:35.890
This is the past perfect tense and I know
it can be tricky for a lot of English learners.

01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:41.599
We use the past perfect tense to talk about
something that was continuing for a long time

01:33:41.599 --> 01:33:45.429
in the past and now, it has stopped.

01:33:45.429 --> 01:33:48.179
Do you know why my dream has stopped?

01:33:48.179 --> 01:33:49.800
Oh, because it came true.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:50.800
I own a Ferrari.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.710
Of course, this is a fake situation, just
imaginary.

01:33:54.710 --> 01:34:00.969
Vanessa: But because this dream came true,
well, we can say that it has stopped.

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:09.810
So we need to make the sentence, for my whole
life, I had always dreamed of owning a Ferrari,

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:10.900
and now, I do.

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.349
Now that dream has come true.

01:34:13.349 --> 01:34:18.220
If you'd like to learn more about how to use
the past perfect tense or the future perfect

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.470
tense, you can click on this live lesson that
I made up here a long time ago.

01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:27.679
There's one full lesson about the past perfect
tense and one full lesson about the present

01:34:27.679 --> 01:34:28.679
perfect tense.

01:34:28.679 --> 01:34:33.630
These can be tricky, so please take your time,
be patient with yourself and study them and

01:34:33.630 --> 01:34:34.630
take some notes.

01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:35.920
All right, let's go to the next sentence.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.640
Vanessa: Sentence number six.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:44.310
Not only is my Ferrari beautiful, but it is
fun to drive.

01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:49.210
Not only is my Ferrari beautiful, but it is
fun to drive.

01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:51.820
How can we make this sentence better?Huh?

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:56.620
Three two, one.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:35:06.130
Not only is my Ferrari beautiful, but it's
also fun to drive.

01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:11.440
We need to add the word also, and our key
here is the first part of that sentence uses

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:16.790
not only, and then the second part needs but
also.

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:21.110
This is an advanced phrase, not only, but
also that's going to make your sentences more

01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:22.110
complex.

01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:26.440
Instead of just saying simple sentences, my
Ferrari's beautiful.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440
It's fun to drive.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.330
We can combine those with a beautiful advanced
expression like this, not only is my Ferrari

01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:35.300
beautiful, but it is also fun to drive.

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:41.369
We use not only, but also to give some more
information about something, but it's really

01:35:41.369 --> 01:35:46.070
to take it to a higher level, to kind of escalate
something.

01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:48.969
Vanessa: So here, my Ferrari's beautiful.

01:35:48.969 --> 01:35:49.969
Okay.

01:35:49.969 --> 01:35:53.929
But the next level is, oh, it's also fun to
drive.

01:35:53.929 --> 01:35:56.989
On top of that, it is also fun to drive.

01:35:56.989 --> 01:36:05.040
So you might say, not only is this lesson
useful, but it is also fun.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.140
I hope that this lesson is useful to you,
but I hope it's not boring.

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.849
I hope it's also fun.

01:36:10.849 --> 01:36:12.449
We're taking it to the next level.

01:36:12.449 --> 01:36:13.880
All right, let's go to the next one.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.949
Vanessa: Sentence number seven.

01:36:15.949 --> 01:36:21.320
If I crashed the car, I will cry.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.599
If I crashed the car, I will cry.

01:36:23.599 --> 01:36:24.599
Hmm.

01:36:24.599 --> 01:36:27.229
Can you imagine this situation?

01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:30.329
Spending so much money on a car and then crashing
it?

01:36:30.329 --> 01:36:31.329
And that's it.

01:36:31.329 --> 01:36:32.329
That would be terrible.

01:36:32.329 --> 01:36:33.530
All right.

01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:37.680
Let's think about what is the best way to
fix this sentence.

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.610
Three, two, one.

01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:43.800
This is a hypothetical, imaginary situation.

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.409
If you are listening to my quick little explanation,
you might've guessed the correct answer.

01:36:48.409 --> 01:36:53.389
If I crashed the car, I would cry.

01:36:53.389 --> 01:36:59.860
We use if plus would to talk about these imaginary,
hypothetical situations.

01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:02.810
It's not happening right now, so we need to
use would.

01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:07.409
If you'd like to learn how to use would in
other situations or some more in depth examples

01:37:07.409 --> 01:37:13.150
about it, make sure you check out another
test I made, should, would and could, and

01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:15.090
how do you use them correctly.

01:37:15.090 --> 01:37:17.290
How did you do on this test about my Ferrari?

01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:18.380
I hope you enjoyed it.

01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.199
Now it's time to do a little review.

01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:24.150
Vanessa: Let's go back and read all of those
sentences using the correct words that you

01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:27.320
can visually see it and also hear it one more
time.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.890
I bought a new Ferrari yesterday.

01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:33.480
I wanted a Ferrari because it's really fast.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.460
When I bought the car, it cost $300,000.

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:42.550
I think I'm going to eat only rice and beans
for one year.

01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:47.080
For my whole life, I had always dreamed of
owning a Ferrari.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:51.969
Not only is my Ferrari beautiful, but it's
also fun to drive.

01:37:51.969 --> 01:37:55.650
If I crashed the car, I think I would cry.

01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:57.099
How did you do on this test?

01:37:57.099 --> 01:38:00.730
Let me know in the comments what your score
was.

01:38:00.730 --> 01:38:08.240
Vanessa: Do you want to understand movies
and TV shows and fast English speakers?

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.949
Yes, of course you do, but there are countless
reductions and linking in English that make

01:38:13.949 --> 01:38:20.360
it difficult, so the best way to understand
fast English conversations is to study fast

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.150
English conversations, and that's what we're
going to do today.

01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:28.910
We're going to be listening to five quick
English conversations and I'm going to give

01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:32.570
you three sentences for each conversation.

01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:38.450
I want you to guess which sentence you hear
in each conversation.

01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:42.570
If this exercise is too easy for you, then
this is my challenge.

01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:47.020
I challenge you to not look at the screen,
but to try to write every single word that

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.620
you hear from that conversation.

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:54.329
This way, instead of listening for specific
words that you already know will happen in

01:38:54.329 --> 01:38:58.840
that conversation that I give to you, you're
going to be trying to write just from your

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:01.460
listening skills every word that you hear.

01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:06.320
Vanessa: These conversations that you're about
to hear are all part of the 30-day listening

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.389
challenge pack four, which is open now until
December 31st.

01:39:12.389 --> 01:39:17.060
If you'd like to join hundreds of other English
learners who are deciding to start the new

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:21.409
year 2020 by improving your listening skills,
great.

01:39:21.409 --> 01:39:25.340
You can click on the link up here or in the
description to find out more about the listening

01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.340
challenge.

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.380
Vanessa: Are you ready to listen to the first
conversation?

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:33.120
I'm going to give you three sentences that
I want you to listen for.

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.150
I want you to choose which one is going to
be in the conversation.

01:39:37.150 --> 01:39:39.170
Let's take a look at those sentences.

01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:41.599
You didn't take it seriously.

01:39:41.599 --> 01:39:43.980
You didn't take in seriously.

01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:46.820
You didn't take on seriously.

01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:50.989
Let's listen to the conversation clip and
I want you to choose, did you hear number

01:39:50.989 --> 01:39:52.590
one, two or three?

01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:55.150
All right, let's listen a couple of times
to the clip.

01:39:55.150 --> 01:39:58.540
Dan: I had probably kind of poor work ethic.

01:39:58.540 --> 01:39:59.540
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:00.540
[Listen carefully!]

01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:02.400
Dan: But I didn't have to try very hard in
high school.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:04.929
Vanessa: As in you could do okay in high school?

01:40:04.929 --> 01:40:10.270
Dan: I didn't have to study that much to get
by in my high school because my high school

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:12.660
didn't have very high standards.

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.950
Vanessa: Oh, I see.

01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:17.489
Dan: I had probably kind of poor work ethic.

01:40:17.489 --> 01:40:18.489
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

01:40:18.489 --> 01:40:19.489
[Listen carefully!]

01:40:19.489 --> 01:40:21.349
Dan: But I didn't have to try very hard in
high school.

01:40:21.349 --> 01:40:23.952
Vanessa: As in you could do okay and high
school?

01:40:23.952 --> 01:40:29.219
Dan: I didn't have to study that much to get
by in my high school because my high school

01:40:29.219 --> 01:40:31.060
didn't have very high standards.

01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.750
Vanessa: Oh, I see.

01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:34.590
Vanessa: Which sentence did you hear?

01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:38.869
Did you hear number one, you didn't take it
seriously?

01:40:38.869 --> 01:40:40.110
I hope so.

01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:44.780
In this conversation, Dan said that he didn't
work really hard in high school and I kind

01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:50.440
of clarified his statement by saying, "You
didn't take it seriously."

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.679
What is it in this sentence?

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:57.050
It's school, you didn't take school seriously.

01:40:57.050 --> 01:41:00.930
This is a wonderful expression to take something
seriously.

01:41:00.930 --> 01:41:04.480
Let's listen to that clip again and now that
you know which sentence you're listening for

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:09.360
and you kind of know the general idea of the
clip, hopefully, you'll be able to hear it

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.360
clear.

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.139
Dan: I had probably kind of poor work ethic.

01:41:13.139 --> 01:41:14.139
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

01:41:14.139 --> 01:41:15.139
You didn't take it seriously?

01:41:15.139 --> 01:41:17.650
Dan: But I didn't have to try very hard in
high school.

01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:20.520
I had probably kind of poor work ethic.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.520
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.520
You didn't take it seriously?

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.500
Dan: But I didn't have to try very hard in
high school.

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:28.260
Vanessa: Did you hear you didn't take it seriously?

01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:29.469
I hope so.

01:41:29.469 --> 01:41:32.280
Let's go on to quiz question number two.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.090
While you listen to this clip, I want you
to guess which one of these sentences you're

01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:37.450
actually hearing.

01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:43.010
Is it number one, you have be like five or
six years old.

01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:47.400
Number two, you have to be like five or six
years old.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:52.119
Or number three, you have to been like five
or six old.

01:41:52.119 --> 01:41:54.960
Let's listen to the clip and choose which
one you're hearing.

01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.940
Vanessa: So they have it for all ages?

01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:57.940
James: Yes.

01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.561
Well, I think you have to be a certain age.

01:42:00.561 --> 01:42:02.430
[Listen carefully!]

01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:03.430
Vanessa: Oh, got you.

01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:08.070
So at least at that studio, are there quite
a few adults who are a part of the program?

01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:11.130
James: Yes, there are definitely more people
there.

01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:15.340
I'm typically the oldest one in the place
for the most part.

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:16.599
I'm 45.

01:42:16.599 --> 01:42:18.700
Vanessa: So they have it for all ages?

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.700
James: Yes.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:22.390
Well, I think you have to be a certain age.

01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:24.130
[Listen carefully!]

01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:25.130
Vanessa: Oh, got you.

01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:29.900
So at least at that studio, are there quite
a few adults who are a part of the program?

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.950
James: Yes, there are definitely more people
there.

01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:36.970
I'm typically the oldest one in the place
for the most part.

01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:37.970
I'm 45.

01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:39.869
Vanessa: Which sentence did you hear?

01:42:39.869 --> 01:42:45.760
Did you hear, number two, you have to be like
five or six years old?

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:51.369
Here in this clip, James is talking about
the minimum age to participate in the martial

01:42:51.369 --> 01:42:53.750
arts club that he's a part of.

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:56.239
It's five or six years old.

01:42:56.239 --> 01:42:58.969
Did you also hear how old he is?

01:42:58.969 --> 01:42:59.969
Hmm.

01:42:59.969 --> 01:43:00.969
Did you catch that number?

01:43:00.969 --> 01:43:01.969
He said 45.

01:43:01.969 --> 01:43:06.829
All right, we're going to listen to that key
sentence a couple times so that you can hear

01:43:06.829 --> 01:43:10.910
you have to be like five or six years old.

01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:11.910
Let's listen.

01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:13.480
Vanessa: So they have it for all ages?

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.480
James: Yes.

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.000
Well, I think you have to be a certain age.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.199
You have to be like five or six years old.

01:43:19.199 --> 01:43:21.290
Vanessa: So they have it for all ages?

01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:22.290
James: Yes.

01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:24.901
Well, I think you have to be a certain age.

01:43:24.901 --> 01:43:27.010
You have to be like five or six years old.

01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:30.320
Vanessa: Did you hear you have to be like
five or six years old?

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.320
I hope so.

01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.320
Let's go on to quiz question number three.

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.680
I want you to listen for which one of these
three sentences you here.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:40.980
Number one, she spent up living with me for
seven months.

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:45.349
Number two, she went up living with me for
seven months.

01:43:45.349 --> 01:43:48.960
Number three, she ended up living with me
for seven months.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.090
Let's listen to the clip and I want you to
choose which sentence you hear.

01:43:52.090 --> 01:43:55.340
David: Actually, when I was there, I met a
girl from Montreal.

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.989
Chantelle, her name was.

01:43:56.989 --> 01:44:02.010
I saw her on the beach and I said, "Oh, she's
beautiful.

01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:03.849
I must meet her."

01:44:03.849 --> 01:44:06.320
She spoke no English.

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.639
I spoke no French.

01:44:07.639 --> 01:44:09.020
Vanessa: Oh, that didn't matter.

01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:10.780
David: She had a friend that was with her.

01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:17.420
They had come down from Montreal for a vacation
a couple of weeks and

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:20.020
[Listen carefully!]

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:24.180
David: Actually, when I was there, I met a
girl from Montreal.

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.000
Chantelle, her name was.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.630
I saw her on the beach and I said, "Oh, she's
beautiful.

01:44:30.630 --> 01:44:32.469
I must meet her."

01:44:32.469 --> 01:44:34.940
She spoke no English.

01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.270
I spoke no French.

01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:37.650
Vanessa: Oh, that didn't matter.

01:44:37.650 --> 01:44:39.409
David: She had a friend that was with her.

01:44:39.409 --> 01:44:46.050
They had come down from Montreal for a vacation
a couple of weeks and

01:44:46.050 --> 01:44:48.219
[Listen carefully!]

01:44:48.219 --> 01:44:49.849
Vanessa: Which sentence did you hear?

01:44:49.849 --> 01:44:51.450
Did you hear number three?

01:44:51.450 --> 01:44:53.831
She ended up living with me for seven months?

01:44:53.831 --> 01:44:56.170
I hope so.

01:44:56.170 --> 01:45:01.550
In this quick conversation, David's talking
about a special girl who he met and they didn't

01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:04.489
speak the same language, but it didn't matter.

01:45:04.489 --> 01:45:07.510
They lived together for seven months.

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:10.429
He uses a great phrasal verb to end up.

01:45:10.429 --> 01:45:14.000
She ended up living with me for seven months.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.530
We use this phrasal verb to end up to talk
about a conclusion, but it's usually a surprising

01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:20.670
conclusion.

01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:27.000
For example, I checked in to my flight to
go to New York City and I ended up getting

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.139
moved to first class.

01:45:29.139 --> 01:45:34.670
Whoa, this is a surprising conclusion because
I didn't pay for first class, I didn't expect

01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:36.179
to be in first class.

01:45:36.179 --> 01:45:41.000
Maybe they had some extra seats or they needed
to put someone else in the back of the plane,

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.780
so we could say, "I ended up getting moved
to first class."

01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:45.780
Great.

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.780
All right.

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:50.429
Let's listen to that original clip again so
that you can hear a little bit more accurately

01:45:50.429 --> 01:45:51.550
everything that we say.

01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:53.580
David: She had a friend that was with her.

01:45:53.580 --> 01:46:00.219
They had come down from Montreal for a vacation
a couple of weeks and she ended up living

01:46:00.219 --> 01:46:02.280
with me for seven months.

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.790
David: She had a friend that was with her.

01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:11.429
They had come down from Montreal for a vacation
a couple of weeks and she ended up living

01:46:11.429 --> 01:46:13.580
with me for seven months.

01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.469
Vanessa: Did you hear ended up?

01:46:16.469 --> 01:46:17.469
I hope so.

01:46:17.469 --> 01:46:19.840
Let's go on to quiz question number four.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.050
I want you to listen for which one of these
three sentences you're about to hear.

01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:29.000
Number one, I just kind of self got myself
the rest.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.530
Number two, I just kind of self taught myself
the rest.

01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:37.960
Number three, I just kind of self bought myself
the rest.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:38.960
Let's listen.

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:41.489
Jesse: It actually started with a friend of
mine that was not Cherokee at all.

01:46:41.489 --> 01:46:46.110
Even though she had no native American heritage,
she was still interested in it.

01:46:46.110 --> 01:46:53.579
She taught me and I make the rooms with different
types of sticks, all different types.

01:46:53.579 --> 01:46:55.260
Vanessa: Yeah, it looks definitely natural.

01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.710
Jesse: All different types.

01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:58.739
Vanessa: She got into making dream catchers.

01:46:58.739 --> 01:46:59.739
Jesse: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:46:59.739 --> 01:47:02.810
And she showed me and then [Listen carefully!]

01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:06.530
Jesse: It actually started with a friend of
mine that was not Cherokee at all.

01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:10.829
Even though she had no native American heritage,
she was still interested in it.

01:47:10.829 --> 01:47:18.340
She taught me and I make the rooms with different
types of sticks, all different types.

01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:19.880
Vanessa: It looks definitely natural.

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.429
Jesse: All different types.

01:47:21.429 --> 01:47:23.480
Vanessa: She got into making dream catchers.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.480
Jesse: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:27.510
And she showed me and then [Listen carefully!]

01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:29.530
Vanessa: Which sentence did you hear?

01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:31.220
Did you hear number two?

01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.869
I just kind of self taught myself the rest?

01:47:34.869 --> 01:47:36.369
I hope so.

01:47:36.369 --> 01:47:42.980
In this quick conversation clip, Jesse is
talking about learning a native American craft

01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:45.139
called dream catchers.

01:47:45.139 --> 01:47:51.940
She explains that her friend who has no native
American heritage taught her some basics about

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:56.210
how to make them, but Jessie self-taught.

01:47:56.210 --> 01:47:59.920
She taught herself the rest.

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.579
What is this expression, the rest, mean?

01:48:02.579 --> 01:48:07.219
This means that she learned the remaining
part by herself.

01:48:07.219 --> 01:48:13.679
For example, I cleaned most of my house in
the morning and then I cleaned the rest in

01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:14.870
the afternoon.

01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:18.679
I cleaned the remaining part of my house in
the afternoon.

01:48:18.679 --> 01:48:19.699
All right.

01:48:19.699 --> 01:48:24.050
Let's listen to that original clip again so
that you can hear and hopefully catch those

01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:25.050
expressions.

01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:26.050
Let's listen.

01:48:26.050 --> 01:48:27.500
Vanessa: She got into making dream catchers.

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:28.500
Jesse: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:31.500
And she showed me and then I just kind of
self taught myself the rest.

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.840
Vanessa: She got into making dream catchers.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:34.840
Jesse: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:37.929
And she showed me and then I just kind of
self taught myself the rest.

01:48:37.929 --> 01:48:41.760
Vanessa: Did you hear I just kind of self
taught myself the rest?

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.929
I hope so.

01:48:42.929 --> 01:48:45.620
Let's move on to the final quiz question number
five.

01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:50.190
This one's a little bit tricky because we
speak at the same time as each other, but

01:48:50.190 --> 01:48:51.469
you've got it.

01:48:51.469 --> 01:48:52.469
Listen carefully.

01:48:52.469 --> 01:48:54.829
Which one of these three sentences are you
going to hear?

01:48:54.829 --> 01:48:59.159
Number one, they're coming to the restaurant
to avoid that.

01:48:59.159 --> 01:49:03.090
Number two, they come in to the restaurant
to avoid that.

01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:06.889
Number three, they're come to the restaurant
to avoid that.

01:49:06.889 --> 01:49:07.889
Let's listen.

01:49:07.889 --> 01:49:12.520
Kevin: I'd never got an autograph except one
time in all these years and it was from David

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:17.920
Bowie, because my chef was in love with David
Bowie and it was just a big deal.

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:21.190
Vanessa: Yeah, you can't be the paparazzi
when [Listen carefully!]

01:49:21.190 --> 01:49:22.190
Kevin: Right.

01:49:22.190 --> 01:49:23.190
Vanessa: ... [Listen carefully!]

01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:25.450
Kevin: I mean, tourists find out where they
are.

01:49:25.450 --> 01:49:30.800
Kevin: I'd never got an autograph except one
time in all these years and it was from David

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:36.199
Bowie, because my chef was in love with David
Bowie and it was just a big deal.

01:49:36.199 --> 01:49:39.420
Vanessa: Yeah, you can't be the paparazzi
when [Listen carefully!]

01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.420
Kevin: Right.

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:41.420
Vanessa: . [Listen carefully!]

01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:43.300
Kevin: I mean, tourists find out where they
are.

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:45.139
Vanessa: Which sentence did you hear?

01:49:45.139 --> 01:49:48.079
Did you hear sentence number one?

01:49:48.079 --> 01:49:51.030
They're coming to the restaurant to avoid
that?

01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:52.520
I hope so.

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:57.630
In this conversation clip, Kevin is talking
about his experience as a server in one of

01:49:57.630 --> 01:50:03.400
the most popular restaurants in Hollywood
where celebrities like to go to avoid tourists,

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.929
to avoid paparazzi.

01:50:04.929 --> 01:50:08.540
It's kind of a hidden spot where they can
feel safe.

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:13.739
The second sentence that you were listening
for, they come in to the restaurant to avoid

01:50:13.739 --> 01:50:17.530
that, it's grammatically correct, but it's
not what I said.

01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:20.980
So make sure you're listening for exactly
what I said.

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:24.220
They're coming to the restaurant to avoid
that.

01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:28.000
All right, let's listen to that quick clip
again so that you can pick up on this expression.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.170
Vanessa: Yeah, you can't be the paparazzi
when they're coming to the restaurant-

01:50:31.170 --> 01:50:32.170
Kevin: Right.

01:50:32.170 --> 01:50:33.170
Vanessa: ... to avoid that.

01:50:33.170 --> 01:50:34.950
Kevin: I mean, tourists find out where they
are.

01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:38.210
Vanessa: Yeah, you can't be the paparazzi
when they're coming to the restaurant-

01:50:38.210 --> 01:50:39.210
Kevin: Right.

01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:40.210
Vanessa: ... to avoid that.

01:50:40.210 --> 01:50:42.219
Kevin: I mean, tourists find out where they
are.

01:50:42.219 --> 01:50:43.949
Vanessa: How did you do?

01:50:43.949 --> 01:50:47.829
Did you hear they're coming to the restaurant
to avoid that?

01:50:47.829 --> 01:50:49.020
I hope so.

01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:50.639
How did you do on this quiz?

01:50:50.639 --> 01:50:53.180
Let me know in the comments what was your
score.

01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:55.620
Did you get all of them correct, or maybe
none?

01:50:55.620 --> 01:51:00.040
I hope that you can do this quiz again and
again so that you can test your listening

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.040
skills.

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:05.140
If the quiz was easy, like I mentioned at
the beginning, go back, don't look at those

01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:11.160
sample sentences, but just listen to the audio
and try to write exactly what you hear.

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:17.620
See if you can pick up on every single word
without any hints from me.

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:23.699
Vanessa: So your goal is to be a fluent English
speaker, but what does that mean?

01:51:23.699 --> 01:51:26.989
Today, I want to give you a little fluency
test.

01:51:26.989 --> 01:51:31.820
This isn't going to be like tests that you
had in high school with grammar and vocabulary.

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:36.770
I know people who have a great degree in English
or they get the highest scores on English

01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:42.469
exams, but they're still not fluent English
speakers, so this is a real test to tell if

01:51:42.469 --> 01:51:43.599
you're really fluent.

01:51:43.599 --> 01:51:49.599
Vanessa: I'm here in my sunny backyard to
share 10 fluency statements with you.

01:51:49.599 --> 01:51:56.070
If you can say yes to each of these statements,
then congratulations, you're a fluent English

01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:57.070
speaker.

01:51:57.070 --> 01:52:01.599
But if there are any statements that you can't
say yes to, this is what I want you to do.

01:52:01.599 --> 01:52:07.599
I want you to write down that statement, either
on paper or mentally, and I want you to create

01:52:07.599 --> 01:52:13.619
some specific actions that you can take to
increase that statement so that you can say

01:52:13.619 --> 01:52:15.570
yes to that statement.

01:52:15.570 --> 01:52:19.170
Throughout today's lesson, I'm going to be
giving you some actionable tips so that you

01:52:19.170 --> 01:52:22.320
can follow through and really increase your
overall English fluency.

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.560
Vanessa: Are you ready to get started with
fluency statement number one?

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.630
Test yourself.

01:52:27.630 --> 01:52:35.020
I can smoothly have a conversation about almost
any topic in English.

01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:36.559
This is essential.

01:52:36.559 --> 01:52:40.829
In your native language, you can probably
talk about your vacation and then instantly

01:52:40.829 --> 01:52:45.110
jump to talking about how public transportation
is always late.

01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:49.750
You can easily jump from topic to topic without
much hesitation.

01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:52.719
So this is what you need to do in English
as well to be fluent.

01:52:52.719 --> 01:52:56.560
Of course, there will be topics that you won't
be able to talk about smoothly in English,

01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:01.590
but those should also be topics that you can't
talk about smoothly in your native language.

01:53:01.590 --> 01:53:06.690
Vanessa: For example, last week, I was talking
with my friend about a Star Wars movie.

01:53:06.690 --> 01:53:10.260
I don't know much about Star Wars movies,
but I was trying to have a conversation with

01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:15.989
her about it and I was trying to explain,
"You know that guy who wears the white suit,

01:53:15.989 --> 01:53:17.320
he's kind of like a soldier?"

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.139
I couldn't remember the word Stormtrooper.

01:53:19.139 --> 01:53:23.610
And so she said, "Oh, do you mean Stormtrooper?"

01:53:23.610 --> 01:53:24.610
Great.

01:53:24.610 --> 01:53:29.309
We continued our conversation even though
I didn't know exactly what that word is.

01:53:29.309 --> 01:53:34.100
So if you don't know a word in your native
language or you feel uncomfortable talking

01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:38.400
about a topic in your native language, it's
okay if it's the same in English, but those

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.059
two should be a balance.

01:53:40.059 --> 01:53:46.580
Vanessa: Fluency statement number two, I can
think in English and not translate in my head.

01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.810
I like to think of it like a light switch.

01:53:48.810 --> 01:53:52.599
You can turn it on for English or off for
English.

01:53:52.599 --> 01:53:58.469
When someone says a word in my second language,
in French, when someone says Paris with a

01:53:58.469 --> 01:54:03.610
French accent, my brain immediately switches
to French because it was kind of triggered

01:54:03.610 --> 01:54:05.949
by that French sounding word.

01:54:05.949 --> 01:54:12.400
But if you said Paris with an English accent,
well, it doesn't make my brain start to think

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:13.400
in French.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.920
So this is kind of like the light switch idea.

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:21.770
It is on or off, and you need to be able to
keep English on so that you're not translating

01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:22.770
in your head.

01:54:22.770 --> 01:54:26.470
So when you're speaking in English but you
can't remember a word, let's say that you're

01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:29.079
telling me about a car accident that you had
yesterday.

01:54:29.079 --> 01:54:35.040
You might say, "I was driving and then a bird
flew at my car and I drove into a," and you

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.980
can't remember the word, so you explain it
in English.

01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:44.270
Vanessa: "You know that dip or that hole on
the side of the road, usually for water or

01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:45.270
rain?"

01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:47.130
And then your friend says, "A ditch?"

01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:50.610
And you say, "Yes, I drove into a ditch."

01:54:50.610 --> 01:54:55.949
You explained the word ditch in English instead
of immediately saying it in your native language

01:54:55.949 --> 01:54:59.560
because the light switch was turned on to
English.

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:04.460
You probably couldn't even remember that word
in your native language because you weren't

01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:08.050
thinking in your native language, you weren't
translating in your native language.

01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:13.300
Instead, your brain was all in English, and
you just didn't know that word ditch.

01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:16.300
So instead, you're trying to explain it in
English.

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.280
Vanessa: If you've ever had this happen to
you, it's the strangest sensation.

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.840
I remember one time, I ripped my shirt and
I was trying to ask my French friend if she

01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:31.100
had a thread to sew it, but I couldn't remember
the word thread, [foreign language 01:55:31].

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.480
So I just tried to explain it, but do you
know what?

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.900
I couldn't remember the English word for it
either.

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:41.309
It's as if English was completely turned off
and instead, my brain was turned on to the

01:55:41.309 --> 01:55:42.370
other language.

01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:46.139
So if you have experienced this, congratulations,
you're fluent.

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:52.219
Vanessa: The third fluency statement is I
can use English all day and not feel tired.

01:55:52.219 --> 01:55:55.730
Of course, if you have a busy, busy, busy
day in your native language, you're going

01:55:55.730 --> 01:55:56.920
to feel tired.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.580
But when you use English normally throughout
a normal day, you shouldn't feel tired at

01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:03.770
the end of the day.

01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:04.770
This means...

01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:05.770
Vanessa: ... Day, you shouldn't feel tired
at the end of the day.

01:56:05.770 --> 01:56:07.640
This means that you listened to English radio
on the way to work.

01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:09.699
You spoke with your coworkers in English.

01:56:09.699 --> 01:56:15.030
You used an English recipe to cook for dinner
and in these situations you're not mentally

01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:19.199
exhausted because it's tough to think in English.

01:56:19.199 --> 01:56:24.409
Instead, if you feel comfortable and not tired,
congratulations, you're fluent.

01:56:24.409 --> 01:56:30.260
Vanessa: The fourth fluency statement is,
"I can speak and other people don't slow down

01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:32.300
their speaking for me."

01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.170
This is a great way to test your English fluency.

01:56:35.170 --> 01:56:39.600
When you have a conversation with someone
else, if you can tell that they're using different

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:45.849
language for you compared with other people
in your conversation, it means that they don't

01:56:45.849 --> 01:56:48.460
see you as a fluent English speaker.

01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:53.710
But, when someone can speak with you without
slowing down because they realize, "Oh, you

01:56:53.710 --> 01:56:54.710
can understand.

01:56:54.710 --> 01:56:55.710
It's going to be fine.

01:56:55.710 --> 01:56:57.560
We're going to be able to have a normal conversation."

01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.560
Great.

01:56:58.560 --> 01:56:59.560
You're fluent.

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.989
Vanessa: This is especially true when you're
speaking with someone who isn't an English

01:57:03.989 --> 01:57:04.989
teacher.

01:57:04.989 --> 01:57:09.300
English teachers tend to slow down when they're
speaking with an English learner because it's

01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:10.739
part of our job.

01:57:10.739 --> 01:57:13.409
But when you're talking with someone who's
not an English teacher...

01:57:13.409 --> 01:57:16.820
Maybe you're talking to customer service on
the phone about a problem that you had with

01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:20.900
a product, or maybe you're talking with a
cashier at the grocery store.

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:25.990
If they speak with you at a normal speed,
the same speed that they're talking with everyone

01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:27.300
else at, great.

01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.889
Congratulations, you're fluent.

01:57:28.889 --> 01:57:34.179
Vanessa: Our fifth fluency statement is, "I
can say something but I can't explain the

01:57:34.179 --> 01:57:36.860
grammar because it just feels right."

01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:41.850
If you're speaking but you have no idea why
you correctly used, "I have eaten," instead

01:57:41.850 --> 01:57:43.820
of, "I ate," well, great.

01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:46.650
That means that you've internalized the grammar.

01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:51.280
Maybe you can't explain why this was correct
and why that one's not correct.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.230
You've just internalized it.

01:57:53.230 --> 01:57:54.230
Great.

01:57:54.230 --> 01:57:55.230
You're fluent.

01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:59.010
Vanessa: A good way to test this is by writing
the same way that you speak.

01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:03.239
You could just ask yourself the question,
"What did you do this weekend?"

01:58:03.239 --> 01:58:07.449
And as you're writing your answer, try to
write exactly in the same way that you would

01:58:07.449 --> 01:58:08.449
speak.

01:58:08.449 --> 01:58:12.500
"Well, this weekend, I went to a friend's
house and then I decided to leave early because

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.211
I was feeling a little bit under the weather."

01:58:14.211 --> 01:58:20.741
And as you're writing this, are you thinking
about the specific grammar verb tenses, about

01:58:20.741 --> 01:58:25.110
the sentence structure, or are you just writing
naturally and correctly?

01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:27.449
And this is the same way that you're speaking.

01:58:27.449 --> 01:58:32.290
If you have internalized English grammar and
you can use it correctly without thinking

01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:33.940
about the rules, congratulations.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.010
You're fluent.

01:58:35.010 --> 01:58:39.880
Vanessa: The sixth fluency statement is, "I
can be myself."

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:44.380
I hear a lot of my English students say that
they want to accurately express themselves

01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:45.380
in English.

01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:51.309
And when I hear them say this, what it makes
me think is, "I want to be myself in English."

01:58:51.309 --> 01:58:56.130
You want to show your same personality in
English as you have in your native language.

01:58:56.130 --> 01:59:01.530
So, if you're clever and humorous in your
native language, you want to also be clever

01:59:01.530 --> 01:59:03.020
and humorous in English.

01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:07.699
If you're kind and thoughtful in your native
language, well, you want to also show those

01:59:07.699 --> 01:59:10.280
character traits in English as you speak.

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:14.790
When you feel like your true self is showing
in English, congratulations.

01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:15.969
You're fluent.

01:59:15.969 --> 01:59:20.369
Vanessa: A good way to practice this is by
following the steps that I mention in this

01:59:20.369 --> 01:59:23.969
video up here about how to start speaking
English without fear.

01:59:23.969 --> 01:59:25.500
Make sure you check out that lesson.

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.199
Vanessa: Fluency statement number seven.

01:59:27.199 --> 01:59:34.409
"I can watch English TV shows and movies without
subtitles, just like a native English speaker."

01:59:34.409 --> 01:59:39.290
In my opinion, I feel like TV shows and movies
are a little bit more difficult to understand

01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:42.480
than just daily conversation because it's
scripted.

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:49.330
They use sometimes words and humor that's
extra clever or extra advanced, but if this

01:59:49.330 --> 01:59:54.090
is something that you want to do and you can
actually watch movies and TV shows without

01:59:54.090 --> 01:59:55.090
subtitles, congratulations.

01:59:55.090 --> 01:59:56.090
You're fluent.

01:59:56.090 --> 01:59:59.599
Vanessa: If you'd like to take it to the next
level and be able to understand movies and

01:59:59.599 --> 02:00:04.500
TV shows, but also be able to talk about them,
make sure you check out this lesson I made

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:08.120
here about how to talk about movies and TV
shows in English.

02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:13.059
You'll learn a lot of great phrases and expressions
so that you can enjoy those activities and

02:00:13.059 --> 02:00:15.659
then talk about them in English with other
people.

02:00:15.659 --> 02:00:17.719
Vanessa: Fluency statement number eight.

02:00:17.719 --> 02:00:24.199
"I can understand different accents in English,
native and non-native."

02:00:24.199 --> 02:00:27.210
A lot of you need to use English for your
jobs and that's great.

02:00:27.210 --> 02:00:30.330
That's a great way to be able to use English
on a daily basis.

02:00:30.330 --> 02:00:34.390
Some of you work with Americans, British people,
Australians.

02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:37.980
But a lot of you work with non-native English
speakers.

02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:43.190
People from Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, all
places around the world.

02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:46.840
When you can understand all English accents,
congratulations.

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:47.940
You're fluent.

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:52.340
Vanessa: I remember the first time that I
heard someone speaking French from Canada

02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:56.840
and I realized, "Oh, the way that they speak
is different than the way I hear people speaking

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.000
in France."

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.179
When I could hear that they had a different
accent, I felt so proud of myself because

02:01:03.179 --> 02:01:08.020
I realized, "I can understand them and I can
understand that they have a different accent

02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:09.800
than what I'm used to hearing in France."

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.140
Vanessa: This can be a tough skill to master,
but with YouTube, there's a great way to do

02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:15.140
this.

02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:19.760
If you have some coworkers who are from Germany
and you often speak with them in English,

02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:23.620
you can try to watch videos of Germans speaking
English on YouTube.

02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:28.480
That way you can feel comfortable with the
way they speak, the language choice, the accent,

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:29.480
the intonation.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:34.220
You can just test yourself with YouTube and
kind of train so that when you speak with

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.720
your German coworker in English, great.

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:37.829
You're already prepared.

02:01:37.829 --> 02:01:39.570
Vanessa: Fluency statement number nine.

02:01:39.570 --> 02:01:43.730
"I can understand humor and jokes."

02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:48.280
Of course, the humor and jokes may not be
funny to you, but at least you understand

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:51.139
why they're supposed to be funny.

02:01:51.139 --> 02:01:55.449
There's nothing worse than sitting at a dining
room table with a lot of English speakers

02:01:55.449 --> 02:01:59.910
and they're all laughing and having a good
time, laughing at jokes, and then you're just

02:01:59.910 --> 02:02:03.550
sitting there thinking, "I have no idea what's
funny.

02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:04.650
Why are they laughing?"

02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:09.550
You feel really left out and lonely, but on
the other hand, there's nothing better than

02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:12.500
understanding the humor and laughing with
them.

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.210
It's a great way to bond, to form relationships.

02:02:15.210 --> 02:02:18.400
When you can understand humor and jokes in
English, congratulations.

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.480
You're fluent.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:21.510
Vanessa: Fluency statement number 10.

02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:28.199
"I can read an article, listen to a podcast,
watch a movie in English, and forget what

02:02:28.199 --> 02:02:29.869
language it was in."

02:02:29.869 --> 02:02:33.260
This is such a strange sensation when this
happens.

02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:37.730
I remember one time I was listening to a French
podcast while I was cooking dinner, and then

02:02:37.730 --> 02:02:42.720
during dinner I was asking Dan, my husband,
some questions about the podcast.

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:43.781
He doesn't speak French.

02:02:43.781 --> 02:02:46.810
And he looked at me like, "What are you talking
about?"

02:02:46.810 --> 02:02:49.320
And then I realized, "Oh yeah, I forgot.

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:53.079
That podcast was in French, so you couldn't
understand it."

02:02:53.079 --> 02:02:58.230
So when you can seamlessly jump from one language
to the other, congratulations.

02:02:58.230 --> 02:02:59.510
You're fluent.

02:02:59.510 --> 02:03:04.449
Vanessa: There's one movie called Paris, Je
T’aime, and it's a movie about different

02:03:04.449 --> 02:03:06.809
areas in the city of Paris.

02:03:06.809 --> 02:03:11.650
And in this movie, a lot of the characters
speak in English and then jump immediately

02:03:11.650 --> 02:03:12.810
to French.

02:03:12.810 --> 02:03:17.130
And I remember watching that movie and listening
to all the different languages that they were

02:03:17.130 --> 02:03:21.179
speaking and realizing, "I can understand
this.

02:03:21.179 --> 02:03:22.550
I'm so happy.

02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:26.910
I don't have to use subtitles for part of
it, or feel uncomfortable when they switched

02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:27.910
to French."

02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:34.510
Because I could easily understand both languages,
I felt so happy and so proud of myself.

02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:36.250
And I want you to have that as well.

02:03:36.250 --> 02:03:42.620
So, if you can understand a podcast, a movie,
a TV show, read an article, and then forget,

02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:44.559
"Oh yeah, it was an English," congratulations.

02:03:44.559 --> 02:03:45.559
You're fluent.

02:03:45.559 --> 02:03:47.920
Vanessa: So now I have a question for you.

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:53.110
In the comments, let me know what is your
fluency score according to this test?

02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:58.889
Can you relatively use grammatical structures
without thinking, but it's difficult for you

02:03:58.889 --> 02:04:01.309
to understand all accents in English?

02:04:01.309 --> 02:04:09.050
I want you to take actionable steps so that
you can say, "Yes," to each one of these 10

02:04:09.050 --> 02:04:10.300
fluency statements.

02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:13.300
Vanessa: Do you have good pronunciation?

02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:14.690
How do you know?

02:04:14.690 --> 02:04:18.600
The best way to test your pronunciation is
to speak with someone else and see if they

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:23.800
can understand you, because understanding
is the purpose of pronunciation and of speaking.

02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:27.670
But unfortunately, here on YouTube, I can't
listen to you.

02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:30.230
Maybe YouTube will create that technology
someday in the future.

02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:35.250
So for now, I'd like to give you a different
type of pronunciation test.

02:04:35.250 --> 02:04:41.079
Vanessa: The next best way to test your pronunciation
is to shadow or imitate exactly after a native

02:04:41.079 --> 02:04:45.050
speaker, so that you can see if your pronunciation
is similar to mine.

02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:46.190
Is it different?

02:04:46.190 --> 02:04:48.909
What are the specific areas that are difficult
for you?

02:04:48.909 --> 02:04:53.560
I'm going to be testing your pronunciation
on 16 challenging words.

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:57.579
But the best way to test your pronunciation
is not with individual words, but with a whole

02:04:57.579 --> 02:04:58.579
sentence.

02:04:58.579 --> 02:04:59.809
So this is what we're going to do.

02:04:59.809 --> 02:05:03.980
I'm going to show you a challenge sentence
that uses four difficult words, and this is

02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:05.159
what I want you to do.

02:05:05.159 --> 02:05:09.000
I want you to say that sentence out loud before
I talk about anything.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.389
Vanessa: This is your original pronunciation.

02:05:11.389 --> 02:05:17.000
I want you to hear your original pronunciation,
and then I'm going to read that sentence,

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.450
but I'm going to mispronounce one word.

02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:24.139
I want you to guess which word is mispronounced.

02:05:24.139 --> 02:05:27.159
There are sometimes multiple ways to pronounce
each word.

02:05:27.159 --> 02:05:31.619
But I want you to be listening for what is
the most natural way to pronounce each word

02:05:31.619 --> 02:05:32.639
in fast English.

02:05:32.639 --> 02:05:36.739
Vanessa: And finally, I'm going to be saying
the sentence correctly, and I want you to

02:05:36.739 --> 02:05:37.789
be able to say it with me.

02:05:37.789 --> 02:05:40.489
So I want you to repeat the correct sentence
with me.

02:05:40.489 --> 02:05:42.849
Are you ready to get started with sentence
number one?

02:05:42.849 --> 02:05:43.849
Let's do it.

02:05:43.849 --> 02:05:45.389
Vanessa: This is sentence number one.

02:05:45.389 --> 02:05:48.219
I want you to say this sentence all by yourself.

02:05:48.219 --> 02:05:49.500
Test your original pronunciation.

02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:50.599
Go ahead.

02:05:50.599 --> 02:05:52.710
Say it out loud.

02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:56.010
Vanessa: Okay.

02:05:56.010 --> 02:06:01.290
Now, I'm going to say the sentence and I'm
going to mispronounce one word.

02:06:01.290 --> 02:06:04.270
Can you guess which word I mispronounce?

02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:09.139
I buy cloth-es through the internet.

02:06:09.139 --> 02:06:14.280
I buy cloth-es through the internet.

02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:18.119
Which word did I say incorrectly?

02:06:18.119 --> 02:06:24.230
Did you hear clothes or cloth-es?

02:06:24.230 --> 02:06:27.670
You heard the second one, but really that's
not correct.

02:06:27.670 --> 02:06:34.559
Instead, when we speak in fast English, we
often pronounce, "clothes" a lot like, "Close

02:06:34.559 --> 02:06:35.880
the door."

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:39.409
I buy clothes through the internet.

02:06:39.409 --> 02:06:43.170
Vanessa: All right, let's go through each
of these challenging words, and I want to

02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:45.099
help you say them correctly.

02:06:45.099 --> 02:06:48.389
That first word, buy, buy.

02:06:48.389 --> 02:06:52.610
It sounds exactly like, "Bye, see you later."

02:06:52.610 --> 02:06:53.610
Buy.

02:06:53.610 --> 02:07:01.310
And then we have clothes, which I just mentioned
sounds a lot like, "Close the door."

02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:02.470
Close the door.

02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:08.889
When native speakers are speaking a little
bit slower, they might add a th sound clothes,

02:07:08.889 --> 02:07:10.300
clothes.

02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:12.650
You see how my tongue comes out a little bit
for that T-H?

02:07:12.650 --> 02:07:18.780
Clothes, but really when we're speaking quickly,
it just sounds like close.

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:19.860
Close.

02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:22.390
Vanessa: And then we have the word through.

02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:25.730
Oh, this word is lovely.

02:07:25.730 --> 02:07:32.199
We have a T-H followed by an R. Let's practice
it slowly.

02:07:32.199 --> 02:07:35.449
Your tongue is coming out between your teeth
and there's some air.

02:07:35.449 --> 02:07:39.739
That's a wonderful T-H sound.

02:07:39.739 --> 02:07:41.170
Through.

02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:43.810
It sounds like, "I threw the ball."

02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:45.520
This is the past tense of throw.

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:47.849
I threw the ball.

02:07:47.849 --> 02:07:50.179
So, let's try to say this.

02:07:50.179 --> 02:07:52.360
Through, through.

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:57.040
Vanessa: And then we have our final word,
internet.

02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:59.610
What's happening to that middle T?

02:07:59.610 --> 02:08:00.900
Internet?

02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:06.300
You can say internet with a clear T if you're
speaking a little bit slower, but when native

02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:10.960
speakers are speaking quickly, we're going
to cut out that T completely, and just say

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:14.000
in inner-net, inner-net.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.300
Vanessa: Let's go back and try to say this
full sentence clearly and naturally together.

02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:22.000
Are you ready?

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:28.099
I buy clothes through the internet.

02:08:28.099 --> 02:08:31.690
I buy clothes through the internet.

02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:33.489
Were you repeating with me?

02:08:33.489 --> 02:08:38.170
I hope so because we've got three more challenge
sentences, and I want you to test your pronunciation.

02:08:38.170 --> 02:08:40.010
Vanessa: Let's go to number two.

02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:41.580
Here's sentence number two.

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:45.770
I'm going to pause and I want you to try to
say this sentence all by yourself.

02:08:45.770 --> 02:08:47.730
Test your original pronunciation.

02:08:47.730 --> 02:08:50.210
Go ahead.

02:08:50.210 --> 02:08:52.690
Vanessa: Okay.

02:08:52.690 --> 02:08:56.590
Now I'm going to say it, but I'm going to
mispronounce one word.

02:08:56.590 --> 02:08:58.800
Can you guess which word is incorrect?

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:04.970
A little girl took the recept to the bus.

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:10.150
The little girl took the recept to the bus.

02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:14.310
Which word is wrong?

02:09:14.310 --> 02:09:18.699
Did you hear receipt or recept?

02:09:18.699 --> 02:09:21.960
You heard number two, but that's not correct.

02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:27.520
Instead, the P is silent, so you're going
to say receipt, receipt.

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:31.070
Just completely forget about that P in there.

02:09:31.070 --> 02:09:34.460
Vanessa: All right, let's go through each
of these challenging words because I want

02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:36.950
to make sure that you can pronounce them correctly.

02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:38.810
The first one is little, little.

02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:45.480
You see there's two T's in the middle of this
word, but really in American English, those

02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:47.330
Ts are going to become D sounds.

02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:49.040
So it's going to sound like lid-le.

02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:55.090
Little, like a lid that you put on a container,
little.

02:09:55.090 --> 02:09:57.869
Vanessa: And then we have girl.

02:09:57.869 --> 02:10:02.400
A lot of these words, girl, world, early.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:04.329
Those words can be a little bit tricky.

02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:09.369
So, let's break this one down.

02:10:09.369 --> 02:10:11.659
Grr-l, grr-l.

02:10:11.659 --> 02:10:18.110
When you want to talk about the sound that
an angry dog makes, you could say grr, grr,

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:21.559
and then we're going to add le the end.

02:10:21.559 --> 02:10:22.650
Girl.

02:10:22.650 --> 02:10:24.840
Girl, girl.

02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:28.489
Notice that my mouth isn't really moving here.

02:10:28.489 --> 02:10:31.429
It's all inside my mouth and in my throat.

02:10:31.429 --> 02:10:33.980
Girl, girl.

02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.880
And with the L, my tongue is coming beside
my teeth.

02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:37.880
Girl.

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:39.920
It's right there girl.

02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:40.920
Girl.

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:46.750
Vanessa: All right, and the next word is receipt,
receipt.

02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:49.900
Re-seat receipt.

02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.889
This is the piece of paper you get after you
make a purchase.

02:10:52.889 --> 02:10:55.400
The cashier will give you a receipt.

02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:58.489
Vanessa: And then our final word is bus.

02:10:58.489 --> 02:11:03.199
Sometimes this short u sound can be a little
bit tricky, so I want to make sure you're

02:11:03.199 --> 02:11:06.929
not saying boose, boos, boss.

02:11:06.929 --> 02:11:09.889
Make sure you say, uh, bus.

02:11:09.889 --> 02:11:10.889
Bus.

02:11:10.889 --> 02:11:11.889
Bus.

02:11:11.889 --> 02:11:16.610
Vanessa: All right, let's go back and say
this full sentence together.

02:11:16.610 --> 02:11:23.040
The little girl took the receipt to the bus.

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:28.590
The little girl took the receipt to the bus.

02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:30.060
Did you say that with me?

02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:31.829
Let's say it one more time.

02:11:31.829 --> 02:11:37.909
The little girl took the receipt to the bus.

02:11:37.909 --> 02:11:38.909
Great work.

02:11:38.909 --> 02:11:40.340
Let's go onto the next challenge sentence.

02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:42.929
Vanessa: All right, here's sentence number
three.

02:11:42.929 --> 02:11:44.989
I want you to say it all by yourself.

02:11:44.989 --> 02:11:46.340
Are you ready?

02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:48.520
Test your original pronunciation.

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:51.260
Go ahead.

02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:54.730
Vanessa: Okay, now it's my turn.

02:11:54.730 --> 02:11:56.969
I'm going to mispronounce one word.

02:11:56.969 --> 02:11:58.159
Listen carefully.

02:11:58.159 --> 02:12:04.619
In the early winter, I didn't miss the warum
weather.

02:12:04.619 --> 02:12:11.349
In the early winner, I didn't miss the warum
weather.

02:12:11.349 --> 02:12:16.789
In the early winter, I didn't miss the warum
weather.

02:12:16.789 --> 02:12:21.570
Which one of these challenge words did I mispronounce?

02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:26.710
Did you hear warm or warum?

02:12:26.710 --> 02:12:29.559
You heard that second one, but that's not
correct.

02:12:29.559 --> 02:12:35.600
Instead, the word warm has just one syllable,
not warum.

02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.289
Instead warm, warm.

02:12:39.289 --> 02:12:44.199
Notice how my lips are in an oh shape.

02:12:44.199 --> 02:12:47.610
Warm, warm with a clear R. Warm.

02:12:47.610 --> 02:12:52.330
Vanessa: All right, let's go through each
of these challenge words so that you can say

02:12:52.330 --> 02:12:53.330
them correctly.

02:12:53.330 --> 02:12:56.150
The first one is early.

02:12:56.150 --> 02:13:00.330
This is similar to what we talked about with
girl.

02:13:00.330 --> 02:13:02.809
Er-lee.

02:13:02.809 --> 02:13:06.310
Let's break it into two sections.

02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:11.469
Er, and then lee, lee.

02:13:11.469 --> 02:13:13.409
Early.

02:13:13.409 --> 02:13:21.460
Make sure that when you say the L, your tongue
is touching the back of your teeth, lee, early,

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:23.010
early.

02:13:23.010 --> 02:13:24.530
Don't add another sound in there.

02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:32.179
I often hear English learners say earaly,
er-a-lee, but that a in the middle isn't natural,

02:13:32.179 --> 02:13:34.449
so let's make sure you say er-lee and put
it together, early.

02:13:34.449 --> 02:13:37.369
Vanessa: Next, we say winter.

02:13:37.369 --> 02:13:43.469
What is happening to the T in the middle of
this word?

02:13:43.469 --> 02:13:48.840
You might hear native speakers say winter
with a clear T if they're enunciating clearly,

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.130
and maybe speaking a little slowly.

02:13:51.130 --> 02:13:56.570
It's fine to do that, but when native speakers
speak fast, you're going to hear winner.

02:13:56.570 --> 02:13:57.770
Winner.

02:13:57.770 --> 02:13:59.030
When's the Winter Olympics?

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:00.030
Winner.

02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:03.440
This is the same as a winner and a loser.

02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:08.670
It's the same pronunciation, so make sure
that the context helps you to know which word

02:14:08.670 --> 02:14:09.670
it is.

02:14:09.670 --> 02:14:11.880
Does this sound familiar?

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:12.960
Internet winner.

02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:14.050
Yeah.

02:14:14.050 --> 02:14:22.150
We're cutting out that T especially when there's
an N-T in the middle of a word internet, internet.

02:14:22.150 --> 02:14:24.030
Winter, winner.

02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:28.570
You're going to hear that a lot in fast English.

02:14:28.570 --> 02:14:31.760
Vanessa: Next we have the word didn't.

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.340
Didn't.

02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:35.980
But this is the clear pronunciation.

02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:43.389
When native speakers are speaking quickly,
we do not say didn't with each sound pronounced.

02:14:43.389 --> 02:14:46.100
Instead you're going to hear did-n.

02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:47.570
Did-n.

02:14:47.570 --> 02:14:52.369
There's a lot going on here in your throat.

02:14:52.369 --> 02:14:54.349
D-n.

02:14:54.349 --> 02:15:00.170
So that final D is cut short and the final
T as well is cut, so it's really going to

02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:01.789
be just your throat.

02:15:01.789 --> 02:15:03.289
Can you say that with me?

02:15:03.289 --> 02:15:07.800
D-n didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't.

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:15.870
Vanessa: If you have trouble pronouncing or
hearing or understanding contractions, it's

02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:18.449
probably because we cut off a lot of those
sounds.

02:15:18.449 --> 02:15:19.449
We reduce them.

02:15:19.449 --> 02:15:21.510
That's something that's natural in English.

02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:25.260
I made a video about how to pronounce 81 different
contractions.

02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:29.510
You can check it out up here because this
happens to a lot of different contractions

02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:33.360
and I want to make sure you can pronounce
them, but also you can understand them.

02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:39.800
The difference between a positive word, did,
and didn't is very important when you're having

02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:40.800
a conversation.

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:43.070
Vanessa: All right, let's go to the last word.

02:15:43.070 --> 02:15:46.280
Warm, warm, warm.

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.409
Make sure that this is one syllable.

02:15:48.409 --> 02:15:49.510
Warm.

02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:50.610
Warm.

02:15:50.610 --> 02:15:53.980
Do you think you could put all of these words
together?

02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:54.980
You got it.

02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:55.980
Let's say it together.

02:15:55.980 --> 02:16:03.949
Vanessa: In the early winter, I didn't miss
the warm weather.

02:16:03.949 --> 02:16:08.030
In the early winter, I didn't miss the warm
weather.

02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:11.550
In the early winter, I didn't miss the warm
weather.

02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:18.270
In the early winter, I didn't miss the warm
weather.

02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:19.270
Great work.

02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:20.869
All right, let's go to the final challenge
sentence.

02:16:20.869 --> 02:16:23.370
Vanessa: Here's our final challenge sentence.

02:16:23.370 --> 02:16:27.420
Can you say this all by yourself?

02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:30.170
Go ahead.

02:16:30.170 --> 02:16:32.380
Vanessa: Now it's my turn.

02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:34.260
I'm going to mispronounce one word.

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:36.050
I want you to guess which one it is.

02:16:36.050 --> 02:16:41.900
I definitely sought the water at the beach
was salty.

02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:48.090
I definitely sought the water at the beach
was salty.

02:16:48.090 --> 02:16:53.210
Which word is incorrect?

02:16:53.210 --> 02:16:58.790
Did you hear thought or sought?

02:16:58.790 --> 02:17:03.840
You heard the second one, sought, but does
this word start with an S?

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:05.250
Nope.

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:06.840
Instead it starts with a T-H.

02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:12.840
So you need to make sure that your tongue
is between your teeth and there's that stream

02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:14.219
of air coming through.

02:17:14.219 --> 02:17:15.219
Through.

02:17:15.219 --> 02:17:17.270
We already talked about that word.

02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:18.270
Thought.

02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:19.270
Thought.

02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:25.109
Vanessa: All right, let's go through each
of these challenge words so that you can pronounce

02:17:25.109 --> 02:17:26.109
them correctly.

02:17:26.109 --> 02:17:29.399
What's happening with this word, definitely?

02:17:29.399 --> 02:17:30.479
Definitely.

02:17:30.479 --> 02:17:37.099
I feel like words like definitely, certainly,
probably, those words can be a little bit

02:17:37.099 --> 02:17:38.099
tricky.

02:17:38.099 --> 02:17:42.760
I talked about some of those in this pronunciation
lesson up here, but the word definitely, we

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:46.889
use a lot and you probably would like to use
a lot, but you need to pronounce it correctly,

02:17:46.889 --> 02:17:49.250
so let's break it down.

02:17:49.250 --> 02:17:50.889
Def-in-it-lee.

02:17:50.889 --> 02:17:52.529
Def-in-it-lee.

02:17:52.529 --> 02:18:00.750
Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely,
definitely.

02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:06.849
It's definitely a beautiful day.

02:18:06.849 --> 02:18:09.120
This is definitely a helpful lesson.

02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:10.120
I hope so.

02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:14.330
Vanessa: The next word is that lovely word
we just talked about thought.

02:18:14.330 --> 02:18:16.210
Thought.

02:18:16.210 --> 02:18:18.179
Make sure that your tongue is between your
teeth.

02:18:18.179 --> 02:18:25.190
I often hear English learners switching an
S and a T-H sound.

02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:28.990
Sought instead of thought.

02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:33.830
And in some situations, this could be a little
bit difficult for other English speakers to

02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:36.929
understand you, so make sure that you say
this correctly.

02:18:36.929 --> 02:18:38.349
Thought, thought.

02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:41.840
Vanessa: And then we have the word water.

02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:43.050
Water.

02:18:43.050 --> 02:18:45.420
What's the sound that you hear in the middle
of this word?

02:18:45.420 --> 02:18:47.380
Wad-er, wad-er?

02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:50.670
Well, it's not a T sound, water.

02:18:50.670 --> 02:18:55.130
Instead it's a D. Here we have, again, the
T is changing to a D.

02:18:55.130 --> 02:18:57.760
This is typical in American English.

02:18:57.760 --> 02:18:58.760
Wad-er.

02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:01.179
Wad-er I want you to say that with me.

02:19:01.179 --> 02:19:02.469
Water, water.

02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:06.019
Vanessa: And finally we have the word beach.

02:19:06.019 --> 02:19:07.370
Beach.

02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:12.030
A lot of you are concerned that you might
say a rude word instead.

02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:13.630
So let's practice that vowel sound.

02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:17.460
It needs to be a long E. Bee-ch.

02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:20.620
Bee-ch, beach.

02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:23.580
And really the context here is going to help
you a lot.

02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:29.590
So when we're talking about, "The water at
the beach is salty," you're most likely talking

02:19:29.590 --> 02:19:31.370
about the ocean, the sea.

02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:33.540
You're not talking about a rude word.

02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:37.139
So I think the context is going to help you
a lot, but make sure that when you pronounce

02:19:37.139 --> 02:19:39.000
it you say E. Beach.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.279
Vanessa: All right, let's go back and say
that full sentence.

02:19:42.279 --> 02:19:48.069
I definitely thought the water the beach was
salty.

02:19:48.069 --> 02:19:53.850
I definitely thought the water at the beach
was salty.

02:19:53.850 --> 02:19:57.930
I definitely thought the water at the beach
with salty.

02:19:57.930 --> 02:19:58.930
Great work.

02:19:58.930 --> 02:20:02.319
I hope that you had a chance to say that sentence
out loud with me and test your pronunciation.

02:20:02.319 --> 02:20:04.430
Vanessa: Are you ready for a final challenge?

02:20:04.430 --> 02:20:08.420
We're going to go back and say all four of
those sentences and I want you to say them

02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:09.420
out loud with me.

02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:13.850
I'm going to say them two times so that you
can listen and then you can also repeat.

02:20:13.850 --> 02:20:14.850
Are you ready?

02:20:14.850 --> 02:20:15.850
Let's say them together.

02:20:15.850 --> 02:20:19.750
Vanessa: I buy clothes through the internet.

02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:24.140
I buy clothes through the internet.

02:20:24.140 --> 02:20:28.689
The little girl took the receipt to the bus.

02:20:28.689 --> 02:20:33.229
The little girl took the receipt to the bus.

02:20:33.229 --> 02:20:38.710
In the early winter, I didn't miss the warm
weather.

02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:43.510
In the early winter, I didn't miss the warm
weather.

02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:48.440
I definitely thought the water at the beach
was salty.

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:53.020
I definitely thought the water at the beach
was salty.

02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:58.090
Vanessa: Great work testing your pronunciation
muscles, and now I have a question for you.

02:20:58.090 --> 02:21:03.330
Let me know in the comments which one of these
words is the most difficult for you to pronounce.

02:21:03.330 --> 02:21:04.330
Let me know.

02:21:04.330 --> 02:21:07.760
I'm sure that there will be people around
the world who have the same feelings as you.

02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:11.170
It's always good to feel like you're in this
together.

02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:14.050
Vanessa: Wow, you made it.

02:21:14.050 --> 02:21:15.050
Congratulations.

02:21:15.050 --> 02:21:16.529
Now I have a question for you.

02:21:16.529 --> 02:21:20.060

for you?

02:21:20.060 --> 02:21:21.060
