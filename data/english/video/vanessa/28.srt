Vanessa: Hi.

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.590
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.210
Let's talk about describing people.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.509
Today, I'm going to help you learn 82 expressions
for describing people.

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.730
There are three different ways to describe
people.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.599
One of them is to describe their appearance.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.890
I have brown hair.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.510
The second way is to describe their personality
or character.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.609
I'm optimistic.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.800
The third way is to describe their actions
or hobbies.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.960
I'm a teacher.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.559
I like cats.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.039
Today, we're going to specifically focus on
how to describe someone's or maybe your personality

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.280
and character.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.489
Have you ever taken a personality test?

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.000
These kind of tests try to tell you something
new about your character or maybe put you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.550
into a category.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.059
You are a comforter.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.829
You are enthusiastic.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.489
You are a pessimist.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.469
Personally, I hate almost every personality
test.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.290
Why do I need a test to tell me about my personality?

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.590
I already know my personality.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.920
You probably learned a lot about me just from
that statement.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920
I don't need a test.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.860
I don't need someone else to tell me about
my personality.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.760
Having said that, sometimes personality tests
can be really helpful for expanding your vocabulary

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.690
so that you can accurately describe people.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.000
Maybe you just got a new job and you want
to tell your husband about your boss.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.820
You want to explain your boss' character or
maybe how your boss looks or some things that

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.090
your boss does or maybe you're on a first
date with someone and you want to tell them

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.350
the wonderful things about your personality.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.760
You need to describe yourself.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.620
In this lesson, I'm going to give you the
vocabulary to accurately describe other people

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.840
and also yourself.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.930
Today, I want to ask you six questions to
learn more about your personality.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.610
The goal is to choose some of these nouns
and adjectives and create a sentence or maybe

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.310
a couple of sentences describing yourself.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.860
If you feel like this is too personal, you
can kind of create a list for someone else

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.860
in your life.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.599
At the end of this lesson, I have some extra
special material.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.450
You're going to see a conversation with five
native English speakers where we try to describe

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.450
each other.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.209
Hopefully, this will help to also expand your
vocabulary, but you'll have to wait until

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.209
the end of this lesson.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.209
All right.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.350
Let's get started with the first question
on this personality test.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.579
Personality test question number one.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.030
Are your travel plans generally organized?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.250
What about your home and office?

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.519
Are they pretty tidy?

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.390
Tidy means clean.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.390
Things are orderly.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.540
Think about this for a moment.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.540
Organized.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.540
Tidy.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.849
Does this describe you?

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.340
Think about this for three seconds.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.430
Choose yes or no.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.189
Three, two, one.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.010
Let's say you decided to say yes.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.670
My travel plans are generally organized.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.510
My home and office are pretty tidy.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.080
Some great adjectives we can use to describe
you.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.599
I'm organized.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.340
I'm put together.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.590
I have it together.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.280
Here, we're talking about you're life.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.969
You have your life together.

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.569
It is organized.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.569
I'm organized.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.569
I'm put together.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.330
I have it together.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.819
Or you might say I'm A Type.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.480
A Type is compared to B Type, which we'll
talk about in just a moment.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.519
A Type means that you are quite orderly.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.000
There is a place for everything in your life.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.810
You might also a qualifier to some of these
expressions.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.760
I'm so somewhat A Type.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.819
I'm kind of A Type.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.849
I'm pretty A Type.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.520
Here, we're lessening it a little bit.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.329
You're not 100% A Type.

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.069
You're not 100% organized.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.239
I'm somewhat organized.

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.239
Okay.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.239
That's fine.

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.870
Most of us are kind of in the middle of a
lot of these categories, so it's good to use

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.879
these qualifiers.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.790
I'm somewhat organized.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.510
You might also say if you said yes to this
that your travel plans are generally organized,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.359
you might say I'm a doer.

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.359
Doer.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.709
Here the root word is do.

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.079
You do things.

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.630
You don't just think about them and wait for
something to happen.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.630
You do things.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.630
You take action.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.820
I'm a doer.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.870
Or you might say simply I'm clean.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.900
Things in my life are clean.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.710
I'm a clean person.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.870
If you said no to this, no, my travel plans
are not orderly.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.860
My home and office, they are a wreck.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.970
Well, what are some adjectives we can use
to describe you?

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.290
You might be spontaneous or creative.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.660
What if you are not A Type, you are B Type?

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.670
B Type means that you don't always have things
orderly.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.860
Maybe you tend to be slower at doing things.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.800
You think about things a lot.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.530
Usually, B Type people might be a little more
of the creative, spontaneous type.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.190
That's why you're in this list.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.160
Then, we have some negative words that we
can use to describe these people as well.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.010
You might be scatterbrained.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.190
Here, we can imagine in your head things are
not orderly.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.720
They are scattered.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.850
Scattered means unorganized.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.420
If you say to someone you are scatterbrained,
it is not nice.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.250
You could say it about yourself.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.250
That's fine.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.250
I'm scatterbrained.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.340
But, you don't want to say that about someone
else.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.040
During today's lesson for these words that
are definitely rude to say to someone else,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.770
I put a little star beside it so that you
know I should probably be careful saying this

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.160
to other people because these are always negative.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.740
The final thing you might say if you said
no to this question is I'm not clean.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.210
I'm messy.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.210
My life is messy.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.170
My house is messy.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.590
Just things are not organized.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.760
I'm messy.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.270
Did you write down some words that relate
to your personality?

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.350
All right.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.600
Let's go on to the personality test question
number two.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.630
Question number two.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.790
Is it easy to stay relaxed even when you have
pressure?

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.890
Do small events not change how you feel about
the rest of the day?

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.090
Maybe a small negative thing happens and how
cares.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.270
It doesn't bother you.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.760
You can just easily forget about it.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.090
Think about these questions.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.000
Is it true for you?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.500
Yes, I can easily stay relaxed even when there's
pressure.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.070
Yes, I can easily forget about little annoyances
during the day.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.650
Or no, it's hard for me to feel relaxed even
when there's pressure.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.370
Think about this for you and let's talk about
some words in three, two, one.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.970
What if you said yes to this?

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.940
It's easy for me to feel relaxed even when
there's pressure.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.940
Yeah.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.140
If there's small annoying things that happen
during the day, it doesn't bother me.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.770
What are some words we can use to describe
you?

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.940
You could say I'm easygoing.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.720
Nothing phases me.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.660
I'm optimistic.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.530
I'm even-keeled.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.290
We talked about this word in a previous lesson
where Dan and I talked about our relationship,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.740
our marriage together.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.320
He said that I'm even-keeled.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.850
This is a great word.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.330
You might say I'm confident.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.900
I'm calm.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.020
I'm rational.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.650
These are all things that you might use to
describe you if you said yeah, I can easily

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.390
stay relaxed even when there's pressure.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.320
What about if you said no to this question?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.760
What if you said no, I don't easily feel relaxed.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.750
I'm often not relaxed.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.050
I'm often stressed.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.730
What are some words we can use to describe
you?

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.840
We might say I'm sensitive.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.340
This means that things affect you easily.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.840
It's not always a negative thing.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.030
Of course, it depends no the situation.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.610
If you're applying for a high stress job,
you don't want to say I'm sensitive.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.840
It probably means you're not a good fit for
the position, but this could be just to describe

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.880
you personally.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880
I'm sensitive.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.280
Or maybe you might say I'm emotional.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.440
Your emotions play a big part in your life.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.720
Another way to say emotional is moody.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.660
Moody is always a negative thing.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.580
This means you're in a good mood.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:28.250
You're in a bad mood and you're swinging between
those moods and there's no rhyme or reason.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.340
That means there's no predictability.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.120
One day or one moment you feel like this and
the next day or the next moment you feel like

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120
this.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120
You're moody.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.120
This is stronger than emotional.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.279
This is much more negative than emotional,
so don't tell someone you're moody.

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:46.389
Especially if they are moody, it won't go
well.

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:49.390
Do you know what the opposite of optimistic
is?

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.250
You might be pessimistic.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.370
Pessimistic means that the glass is half empty.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.240
The glass is not half full.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.720
The glass is half empty.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.449
This is an expression that means you always
see maybe the negative side or what if this

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:07.449
happens.

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:10.370
You're always asking what if in kind of that
negative way.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.709
Of course, it's good to balance being optimistic
and pessimistic, but these are the two extremes.

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:21.759
The next five words mean something very similar
and they're all negative.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:24.999
I don't recommend telling someone else that
they are these things.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.889
Of course, you can say them about yourself
if you would like.

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:30.700
You might say I'm uptight.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:37.550
Tight, we can kind of imagine something inside
of you is maybe twisted or tight and inside

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.320
of you, you don't feel relaxed.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.579
You're uptight or maybe you're anxious.

00:09:43.579 --> 00:09:48.350
You can say I'm anxious and that describes
your personality, but you might just be anxious

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.590
about one thing.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.139
I'm anxious about my exam tomorrow.

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:53.139
Okay.

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:57.569
Maybe in general, you're not an anxious person,
but you're anxious about that specific activity.

00:09:57.569 --> 00:09:58.569
That's fine.

00:09:58.569 --> 00:10:01.130
That's not really describing your personality.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.959
Every day I'm often anxious.

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:07.889
No, it's just one specific thing or you might
be high strung.

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:13.180
High strung has that same feeling of uptight,
anxious, high strung.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.279
Or you might be a worrier.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.420
A worrier.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.240
She is a worrier.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.579
That means that she worries a lot.

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:22.490
This defines her personality.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:23.519
She's a worrier.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.860
Or we might say neurotic.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.089
He's neurotic.

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:28.089
She's neurotic.

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:29.089
I'm neurotic.

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:30.110
This is quite strong.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.670
You are uptight and a lot of things bother
you.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.559
Let's go on to personality test question number
three.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:39.110
There's actually three questions in one here.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:44.410
They are is it difficult to introduce yourself
to new people?

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:49.640
Do you feel tired after you spend time with
a group of people?

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.800
Is a good book or a good movie more interesting
than a social event?

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.660
Think about those questions for a moment.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.499
Is it difficult to introduce yourself to new
people?

00:10:59.499 --> 00:11:02.000
How do you feel when you get together with
a group of people?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.600
Do you feel tired?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.820
Think about that for a moment.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.279
If the answer is yes or no.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.110
Three, two, one.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:15.550
Let's imagine that you said yeah, it's difficult
to introduce myself to people.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.560
I think that when I get together with a group
of people, I feel so tired.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.050
I would rather read a good book or watch a
movie than go to a social event.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.449
If you said yes to this, let's talk about
some adjectives that can describe you.

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:31.939
You could say I'm reserved.

00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:33.399
I'm shy.

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.879
I'm timid.

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:37.399
I'm introverted.

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.610
Or just simply I prefer small groups.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.329
I know some people are like this.

00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:42.430
They don't like big groups.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:48.579
They would rather get together with just one
other person or maybe two or three other people,

00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:50.279
not a group of 20 people.

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:51.769
I prefer small groups.

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:52.769
I'm introverted.

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:53.769
I'm reserved.

00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:54.769
I'm shy.

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:55.769
I'm timid.

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:57.250
These are all great words.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.040
What about if you said no, I feel energetic
when I get together with a group of people.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.119
I would rather go to a social outing.

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:07.190
It's no problem to introduce myself to new
people.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.369
What are some words we can use to describe
you?

00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:12.399
You could say I'm outgoing.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.019
I'm the life of the party.

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:20.550
Now for this expression, it's probably better
that someone else says this about you just

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.980
because it's maybe not so humble if you say
I'm the life of the party.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.550
It means that everybody loves me.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.089
People love talking with me.

00:12:29.089 --> 00:12:35.510
It's probably better if your friend said "Yeah,
Vanessa, she's the life of the party," instead

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.930
of me saying it about myself.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.079
But, this might be an expression you can use
to talk about someone like this.

00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:46.069
Or you might be the opposite of introverted,
extroverted.

00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:50.399
You are at ease in social situations.

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:52.589
You take initiative.

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:54.300
You are social.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.279
This word initiative is a beautiful word.

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:01.860
We can imagine that when there are are two
people maybe in a gathering and they both

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.050
are kind of looking at each other, but they
don't really want to start a conversation,

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:11.060
the person who starts the conversation, that
person takes initiative.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.010
They took that opportunity.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.990
If you have no problem introducing yourself
to other people or maybe asking questions

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.199
at a store, you take initiative.

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:25.060
Let's go on to question number four of this
personality test.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:31.269
Do you often get lost in thought and kind
of forget your surroundings?

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:34.559
Do you often think about the meaning of life?

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:37.709
Do you get lost in thought?

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:41.529
Things are going on in your head and you're
thinking about those things not the things

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:42.740
about you.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.139
Do you often think about the meaning of life?

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:46.449
What is life?

00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:47.449
Think about this question.

00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:48.449
Is it true for you?

00:13:48.449 --> 00:13:49.749
Is it not true for you?

00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:51.889
Three, two, one.

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:55.829
Let's imagine that you said yeah, I do often
kind of get lost in thought.

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:59.019
Yeah, I do think about the meaning of life
often.

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:01.360
What are some words we use to describe you?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.649
You might say I'm deep.

00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:10.660
Now, this is an expression kind of like I'm
the life of the party that it's not so humble.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.329
If someone is deep, this is a compliment.

00:14:13.329 --> 00:14:16.699
It means that they have a lot of wisdom.

00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:20.040
It's probably better for you to say it about
someone else.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.220
I really like talking to my cousin.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220
He's so deep.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.249
He has such interesting thoughts.

00:14:25.249 --> 00:14:26.850
Instead of saying it about yourself.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.149
You may also say I care about finding truth.

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:32.420
This another way deep.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.480
I care about finding truth.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.269
Or you might be the kind of person who is
critical.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:40.179
I'm critical of things.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:43.639
If someone tells me something, I often question
it.

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:44.639
Is it true?

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:45.639
Is that real?

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:49.740
On the negative side, you might say cynical.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:56.529
Cynical is always a negative word and that
just means that yes that person asks questions,

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.709
but they always doubt.

00:14:58.709 --> 00:15:02.059
They're not just asking questions, but they're
always doubting.

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:04.119
Is that true?

00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:05.610
There's no way that that's true.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.790
They're cynical.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.399
They're always doubting.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:12.750
If you often get lost in thought, you might
say I'm a dreamer.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.480
I often like to daydream.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.430
I'm lost in my own world.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.550
I live in my head.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.509
They're not things that you want to say in
a job interview, but they're not necessarily

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:31.510
bad, so you can say them to your friends or
say them about yourself.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:38.550
If you want to say this in a negative way,
you could say I'm a million miles away or

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.519
she's a million miles away.

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:41.999
She's not paying attention.

00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:44.410
She is a million miles away.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.410
That's pretty negative.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.490
Then if you want to be really negative, you
could say I'm an airhead.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:53.759
We can imagine your head is filled with nothing
but air.

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:57.439
I'm often lost in thought and I forget the
things around me.

00:15:57.439 --> 00:15:58.970
I am an airhead.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:07.029
This is a similar category as someone who
often thinks about things, but it's quite

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.130
different from being deep.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.309
If you're deep, your head is filled with a
lot of thoughts.

00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:17.240
But then on the negative side, you might say
airhead for having no thoughts.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.929
Your often lost in your own world.

00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:22.869
You're often in your head, but you're not
thinking about anything.

00:16:22.869 --> 00:16:24.379
Just an airhead.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:27.730
What if you said no, I'm not often lost in
thought.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.610
I don't really think about the meaning of
life that often.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.920
Life is life.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.470
No, why would I care what the meaning of life
is?

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.019
What would you say on the other side?

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:39.749
You could say I'm alert.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:43.429
You don't often get lost in your thoughts
because you're looking around.

00:16:43.429 --> 00:16:46.559
You are alert to the things going on around
you.

00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:49.059
You notice little details.

00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:55.689
Maybe people who are lost in thought, they're
not thinking about the physical details around

00:16:55.689 --> 00:16:56.790
them.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:02.459
They don't realize there's a cup over there,
my friend just walked by.

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:05.339
If you are alert, you're noticing those things.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.220
You might also I'm detail-oriented.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:14.490
You notice lots of little details or you might
say I'm astute.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.490
These are great things for a job interview.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.899
I'm detail-oriented.

00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:19.579
I'm alert and astute.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.689
This means that you will not forget little
things because you are organized.

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:26.500
You are able to keep track of physical details.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.350
Similar to alert, you might say aware.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.309
I'm aware of my surroundings.

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:33.559
You're not lost in your head.

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:34.710
You are aware.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.210
Or you might be a realist.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.669
A realist.

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:42.160
This is quite the opposite of somebody who's
thinking about the meaning of life.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.409
Well, if I think about the meaning of life,
I'm never going to really find out, so why

00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:48.950
would I waste my time?

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.429
A realist would say that.

00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:56.299
If you think, you might be a realist or you
might just be practical.

00:17:56.299 --> 00:17:59.240
Practical and a realist are both quite similar.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240
You are practical.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.710
You're not going to waste your time if you
know that something won't be profitable or

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.250
won't be helpful.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.919
I don't think it's really helpful to contemplate
the meaning of life.

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:11.230
I'm just practical.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.750
This might be something you can use to describe
you.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.950
Let's go on to the next question.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.580
Personality test question number five.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.929
When you want something, do you often not
change your mind?

00:18:23.929 --> 00:18:28.179
When you want something, do you often not
change your mind?

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:29.179
Think about this.

00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:30.179
Is that true for you?

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:33.970
You don't change your mind or I'll say I change
my mind.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.940
Well, it's not so serious for me.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:37.940
Think about this.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.830
Three, two, one.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.880
Let's imagine that you said yes, it is true
for me.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.870
When I want something, I don't often change
my mind.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.140
What are some words we can use to describe
you?

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.010
We could say you are diligent.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.330
You're motivated.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.650
I want to study English.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.240
I'm going to become fluid in English.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.390
I'm going to feel more confident in English
and I will be diligent.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.600
I will study every day.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.650
I'm motivated.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.299
I will study every day.

00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:05.740
You want something and you are not going to
be distracted.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.620
These are positive expressions.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.940
They're great for job interviews.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.090
They're great general personality traits.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.650
There are some negative ways to describe this
as well though.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.710
You might be stubborn.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.059
We have a lovely idiom, stubborn as a mule.

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:22.149
Or we might say you are headstrong.

00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:24.850
Headstrong, this means stubborn.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.399
When you want something, you often refuse
to think about other options.

00:19:29.399 --> 00:19:30.399
I want this.

00:19:30.399 --> 00:19:31.399
I want this.

00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:32.399
I want this.

00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:33.399
I'm not going to think about other things.

00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:34.419
I'm stubborn.

00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:36.450
Or you might be adamant.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:41.490
Adamant, this means that you stick with your
opinion.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:49.590
Let's imagine that you're a teenager and your
mom says "I heard that you were drinking beer

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.630
with some friends behind the school."

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.279
You say "No, Mom, I wasn't doing that.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:58.429
I don't know who you were talking with, but
it wasn't me behind the school doing that."

00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:02.240
She says "Well, I heard from this person that
you were doing it."

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.970
You stick with your opinion.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.049
"No, it wasn't me.

00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:06.049
It wasn't me.

00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:07.220
There's no way that was me."

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.850
You are adamant that that person was not you.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.539
You are adamant about something.

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:18.520
This means that you refuse to change your
story about something.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520
You are adamant.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.620
You also might be opinionated.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.210
You have opinions and you're not really afraid
to share them.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.529
This isn't necessarily a negative thing to
be opinionated.

00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:33.070
Of course if you are opinionated, if you have
strong opinions, especially if these are opinions

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:39.830
that are not shared with a lot of other people,
it's great to be careful about how you present

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:44.360
them, about how you share them with other
people so that they don't think that you are

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.200
pushy.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.460
Pushy is always a negative thing.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:54.140
If you are opinionated, you need to talk about
it in a specific way so that you don't become

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.049
pushy, pushing your opinions on people.

00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:59.440
You might be persistent.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.680
This is similar to adamant, but it's in a
negative way.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680
You are persistent.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.559
"I wasn't drinking behind the school.

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.570
That wasn't me."

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.230
You are persistently keeping with the same
opinion.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.250
Persistent.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.540
Or maybe you have a three-year-old and that
three-year-old is asking for candy.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.540
"I want candy.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.540
Mom, I want candy.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.540
I want candy."

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.360
That three-year-old is persistent.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.760
They are wanting it and they're telling you
again and again and again.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.279
You might hear the word bossy.

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:27.870
I'm bossy.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.980
She's so bossy.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.520
He's bossy.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.230
This is similar to persistent.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.702
Adamant, you're telling someone "You should
do this.

00:21:34.702 --> 00:21:35.702
You should do this.

00:21:35.702 --> 00:21:36.702
You do this.

00:21:36.702 --> 00:21:37.702
You do this."

00:21:37.702 --> 00:21:41.730
Like a boss, but usually if you're a good
boss, you don't act like that.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:42.730
You're much kinder.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.480
But, we use the term bossy for people who
have an opinion and they're not really to

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.039
change it in this negative way.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:52.409
What if you said the opposite thing to this
question?

00:21:52.409 --> 00:21:55.890
What if you said actually sometimes I do change
my mind.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.559
I don't always stick with exactly what I say
I want every single time.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:02.370
What are some other words we can use?

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.440
You could say I'm flexible.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.950
I'm compliant.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.710
I'm reasonable.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.690
I'm open minded.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.690
I'm agreeable.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:18.010
These are all positive things, but what if
we take this to an extreme?

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.799
You might say I'm submissive.

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:25.310
This means that you never stand up for yourself.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:30.860
To stand up for yourself means that you have
something you want and you never tell other

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.860
people.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.809
You are submissive, maybe too submissive.

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:40.019
Or we can use a great expression I often get
walked on.

00:22:40.019 --> 00:22:41.160
Get walked on.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.149
If you have an opinion and you always change
it depending on what other people want, we

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:48.940
can imagine that you are like a doormat.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.740
This is the thing that you walk on to enter
a house.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.080
This is you.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.280
People are always walking on you.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.049
I often get walked on.

00:22:59.049 --> 00:23:05.289
Your desires, your needs often get forgotten
because you don't stand up for yourself.

00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:06.760
I often get walked on.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.130
You could say that about someone else.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:12.559
Yeah, he often gets walked on because he doesn't
feel comfortable standing up for what he wants.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:16.940
He doesn't feel comfortable pushing what he
wants, so he just gets walked on.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.010
Let's go to the next question.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.010
Question number six.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.919
This is our final personality test question.

00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:29.220
When people come over to your house, when
guest come to your house, do they feel comfortable?

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:35.029
Do you go above and beyond what is necessary
to take care of them?

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:36.429
This is a great expression.

00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:38.929
Go above and beyond.

00:23:38.929 --> 00:23:42.330
Maybe it's necessary to give them a glass
of water.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.559
When a guest comes to your house, you say
"Sit on the couch.

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:46.559
Here's a glass of water."

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:49.190
But maybe you go above and beyond.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.429
You do more than that so that your guests
feel comfortable.

00:23:52.429 --> 00:23:54.010
Is that true for you?

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.639
Do your guests feel comfortable?

00:23:55.639 --> 00:23:58.340
Do you do more than is necessary?

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.340
Think about that for a moment.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.360
Is it true or not true for you?

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.330
Three, two, one.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:08.399
Let's say that this is true for you, that
you make your guests feel comfortable and

00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:09.840
you do more than is necessary.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.090
Let's talk about a lot of adjectives that
we could use to describe you.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.590
You are hospitable, nice, friendly.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.690
But here is a big warning.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:28.649
If you come from France, Italy, Spain, Brazil,
Portugal, these romantic language countries

00:24:28.649 --> 00:24:30.700
do not ... Warning, warning, warning.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.080
Do not say sympathetic.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.940
You do not say he is sympathetic.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.409
She is sympathetic.

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:39.990
This does not mean nice in English.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.980
This a false friend and I hear a lot of people
say this.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.510
Instead, in English, we do have the word sympathetic.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:55.980
This means that maybe your brother lost his
job and when you go over to his house, you

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:02.179
bring him some flowers and you bring him a
meal and you sit down and talk with him.

00:25:02.179 --> 00:25:09.250
You talk about that difficult hard time in
his life because you are sympathetic to his

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.800
difficulty.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.490
We usually have a difficult situation happening
and you didn't personally experience that

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.070
difficult thing, but you feel his difficulty.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.120
You feel his pain.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.649
You are sympathetic.

00:25:23.649 --> 00:25:29.470
Here, we're using it in a completely difference
sense than friendly.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.509
Friendly just means you're nice.

00:25:31.509 --> 00:25:36.390
But if someone has a difficult situation,
you are sympathetic to their problem.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.100
You understand I think my brother is really
sad right now.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.250
He's probably worried about the future.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.070
You are understanding his difficult times.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:50.140
I hope I explained this word sympathetic so
that you do not use it and say "Vanessa, you're

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.150
so sympathetic."

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.019
No, no, no, no, no, don't use that.

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.529
What are some other words we can use?

00:25:55.529 --> 00:25:57.930
You could say I'm compassionate.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.850
I'm considerate.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.419
I'm generous.

00:26:01.419 --> 00:26:06.809
This means you give maybe your time or your
money to other people.

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:08.650
You could say I'm warm.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.860
I'm warmhearted.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:15.110
This means that people feel this warm feeling
when they're with you.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.710
They feel like you're such a friendly person.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.270
You could say I'm helpful.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.900
I'm down to earth.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.769
Down to earth is an expression that we used
to mean you are relatable.

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:31.870
People feel like your life is not so different
from theirs.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.919
You often hear this word described with celebrities.

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:40.139
Celebrities, movie stars, they have lives
that are much different than our own, so they

00:26:40.139 --> 00:26:46.880
seem kind of untouchable, so different, but
maybe there is one celebrity who relates to

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.510
the problems of normal people.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.029
Someone might say yeah, she's really down
to earth.

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:54.029
She's down to earth.

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.320
Her feet are on the earth.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.540
She's down to earth.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.230
Or you might say she's sincere.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.230
She's genuine.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.440
She's really herself.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.509
She's not faking it.

00:27:03.509 --> 00:27:06.899
She's dependable or I'm dependable.

00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:10.299
Your friends know that they can depend on
you.

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:11.610
What if you said no to this?

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.980
I imagine that you probably didn't say no
to this about yourself, but you probably know

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.130
somebody like this.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.169
Let's talk about the opposite.

00:27:19.169 --> 00:27:25.559
Someone who is maybe not so generous, not
so considerate or so friendly.

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:27.179
Let's talk about the opposite.

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:29.179
Maybe you know someone who is unpleasant.

00:27:29.179 --> 00:27:34.530
This is a little bit of a nicer way to say
they're so annoying.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.740
They're such a terrible person.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.210
You could just say yeah, he's kind of unpleasant.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.799
I don't really like working with him.

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:42.879
Unpleasant.

00:27:42.879 --> 00:27:45.220
Or someone might because selfish.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.509
They're not generous.

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:48.970
They don't like to go above and beyond.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.280
They're kind of selfish.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.980
Or maybe you know someone who is self centered.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.830
The world revolves around their life.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.669
They are self centered.

00:27:59.669 --> 00:28:02.299
Their self is the center of the universe.

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:04.100
They're self centered.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.309
How did you do?

00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:09.240
How did you answer all of these six personality
test questions?

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.149
I hope you wrote down some adjectives that
you can use to describe yourself.

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:15.240
Write that sentence down in the comments.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.009
But before we go, I'd like to share some extra
material with today.

00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:21.490
You're going to see five native speakers.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:26.210
They are three friends, plus my husband, plus
me.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.649
We are attempting to describe each other.

00:28:29.649 --> 00:28:35.990
I sat down with each of my friends individually
and asked "How would you describe this person?

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.519
How would you describe that person?"

00:28:37.519 --> 00:28:43.090
I didn't tell them specifically to describe
their personality or their character, but

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.610
you'll see that a lot of these people, they
did describe their physical appearance a little

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.610
bit.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.880
But, most of these descriptions had to do
with their personality or character.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.529
You're going to hear some of the words that
we just talked about and maybe you'll hear

00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:57.490
some new words as well.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:59.659
Let's start with my friend Liz.

00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:03.639
You're going to meet Liz, Heather, Lauren,
and Dan.

00:29:03.639 --> 00:29:05.610
They're going to be describing each other.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.019
Let's see what everyone has to say about Liz.

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:11.450
How do they describe Liz?

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.450
Let's watch.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.759
Liz: Hi.

00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:20.809
I'm Liz.
Heather: Gosh, Liz is witty and sarcastic

00:29:20.809 --> 00:29:22.330
to a fault.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.390
Vanessa: I'd say so.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.870
Heather: She's super inquisitive and very
literate.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.399
I’d say that’s very good description of
her.

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:31.399
Vanessa: For sure.

00:29:31.399 --> 00:29:35.870
That's something that I first recognized about
Liz is she's really inquisitive.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.259
She asks great questions.

00:29:37.259 --> 00:29:39.399
Heather: She's curious about life.

00:29:39.399 --> 00:29:40.399
Yeah.

00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:47.909
I'd say she's adventurous for some things,
like travel or things like that.

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:51.279
Not so much food.

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:52.279
She's very loyal.

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:53.960
Very loyal friend.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:04.840
Lauren: Liz is very sarcastic and smart, quick
witted.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:10.740
She's funny and she has nice pretty long brown
hair.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.740
Vanessa: That's true.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.029
Dan: I would describe Liz as very curious.

00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:22.549
Out of many people I know, not many people
will ask you questions a lot.

00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:27.259
When Liz asks you a question, she'll ask more
and more questions, which I'm not hating on.

00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:28.669
I think it's great.

00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:31.549
She's also very assertive.

00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:36.240
Whenever she has an opinion, she usually makes
it very clear.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.809
It's not hidden in any way.

00:30:38.809 --> 00:30:44.389
She's also very friendly though, so the assertiveness
doesn't get in the way of her friendliness.

00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:47.150
Her friendliness shines through.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:53.429
Vanessa: You just heard some amazing adjectives
to describe the wonderful person of Liz.

00:30:53.429 --> 00:30:54.909
Let's go on to the second person.

00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:59.690
You're going to meet Heather and let's see
how everyone describes Heather.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.000
Heather: Hi.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.299
I'm Heather.

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:10.330
Liz: Heather is a short little person and
she has brown hair and amazing freckles and

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.559
she's very creative.

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.149
She's an introvert.

00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:16.960
She's a good painter.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.380
She's very smart.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.380
She's well traveled.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.830
Vanessa: Those are all true things.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:33.690
Lauren: Heather is short like me and she's
kind of got some ... She's dry humored, so

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:39.610
very subtle, also very smart, and well traveled.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.789
She's live in lots of different places.

00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:43.059
Dan: Heather.

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:45.390
Heather is very reserved.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.650
Yet when you get to know her, she's very fun
loving.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.240
She's also very curious.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.249
She's kind of geeky.

00:31:51.249 --> 00:31:55.090
She likes Harry Potter and Star Wars and stuff
like that.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:32:01.020
Yeah, she's very fun and if you get together
with her at a party, you're going to have

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.020
a good time.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.309
Vanessa: I hope you enjoyed those adjectives
to describe Heather.

00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:07.220
Let's go on to Lauren.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.030
How does everyone describe Lauren?

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.380
Lauren: Hi.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.730
I'm Lauren.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.559
Liz: Lauren is also a short little person.

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:21.970
She's got sort of blondish brown hair, sort
of a darker shade of blond.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.590
She has glasses.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:30.800
She to me is very businesslike and she likes
to tell stories with a lot of detail, which

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.600
are always interesting.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:42.009
Heather: Lauren is short, with short hair,
glasses, and I think she's a geek.

00:32:42.009 --> 00:32:45.510
Vanessa: Could you explain what you mean by
geek?

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.529
Is that her interests?

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:47.529
Heather: Yes.

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:48.529
A little bit about her interests.

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:51.140
She's, like Liz, curious about different knowledge
and stuff.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.320
She loves Star Wars, Harry Potter.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320
Vanessa: Exactly.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.980
That kind of stuff.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.309
Heather: Harry Potter.

00:32:57.309 --> 00:32:58.309
Movies.

00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.969
She's definitely a movie buff.

00:32:59.969 --> 00:33:02.240
She can remember almost everything.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.499
All these weird random details.

00:33:04.499 --> 00:33:06.600
Vanessa: Her mind is like steel trap.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.600
Heather: Yes.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.600
Vanessa: She knows everything.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.600
Heather: Yeah.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.790
I think she's also a very loyal friend and
very caring.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:13.790
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:18.830
I've been friends with her for 10 years and
I feel like she is that kind of person.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.830
Heather: She makes an effort.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.830
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.140
Heather: She makes an effort in her relationships,
I think.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.140
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.690
That's a great quality.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:26.690
Heather: Yeah.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:27.690
Very much.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:28.690
Dan: Lauren.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:29.690
Lauren.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.840
Lauren is very loyal, I would say.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.750
When she's your friend, she's your friend
for life.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.049
She'll remember you and she's very detail-oriented.

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:40.720
She'll remember all the details of your relationship.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.760
I don't mean this in a bad way.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.360
I just mean there's always somebody in your
life who gives all those details about your

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.660
life.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.759
She also knows a lot about from my perspective,
a lot about pop culture.

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:59.299
She's always filing me in on the details and
maybe I understand something that she also

00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:03.149
understands and we can have a funny conversation
about that.

00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:04.620
Usually, Vanessa doesn't understand.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.620
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.580
I don't much about pop culture, so Lauren
is my window into this world.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.510
She allows me to learn that stuff.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.909
I hope you learn some great words with those
explanations.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:20.639
Let's go on to my husband, Dan, and see what
everyone else has to say about Dan.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:21.980
Dan: Hi.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.329
I'm Dan.

00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:24.679
Liz: Dan.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:26.659
Dan is so fun.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.340
Dan is this tall, skinny ginger.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:33.669
He's got very great amazing red hair.

00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:35.040
He always has a lot of energy.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.500
I think he's always like "I'm Dan."

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.500
Vanessa: He does have a lot of energy.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:49.309
Liz: He, I feel like, has a lot of strong
opinions about things, which I really like.

00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:50.309
He's married to you and has a baby.

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:51.309
Vanessa: That is true.

00:34:51.309 --> 00:34:53.190
Those are all true facts.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:58.500
Liz: I think he's very relaxed in some ways,
but also cares about details in other ways.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.960
Which is kind of hard to describe, but it's
true.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.960
Vanessa: That is true.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.900
Heather: Dan is a tall, skinny redhead.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.700
Vanessa: That is the first thing Liz said,
too.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.670
Heather: I think he is very creative.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:25.980
I would probably describe him as adventurous,
not afraid to take risks, inquisitive, opinionated.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:30.430
I think he has opinions and he's set in his
way, but I think he's also open for discussion.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.430
Vanessa: Okay.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.430
Heather: Yeah.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.430
Lauren: Dan.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.430
Oh, Dan.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.610
Vanessa: Other people said that too.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:37.610
Dan.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.060
Oh, Dan.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:48.660
Lauren: Dan is thin and he has red hair, very
red hair.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.770
He can be kind of loud and enthusiastic.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.359
That's a good word for Dan.

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:54.359
Vanessa: Enthusiastic.

00:35:54.359 --> 00:35:58.859
Lauren: He's very intelligent too and adventurous.

00:35:58.859 --> 00:36:04.250
He's into lots of different things and learning.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.490
He likes to learn.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.800
Vanessa: Those were some great adjectives
to describe Dan.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.840
Oops, I forgot to say that my friends are
also going to describe me.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.840
Here we go.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.850
Liz: You.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.530
You're just so delightful.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.700
That was my first word for you.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.440
Not just because you're in the room, but because
you are just delightful.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440
Vanessa: That's so nice.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440
Liz: You have effervescent personality.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.770
I feel like you're very uplifting for other
people.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.060
You bring a lot of joy to people.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.309
I feel like you always seem like you have
it together.

00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:40.380
That's definitely my most overarching impression
of you is you have it together.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.030
You're also a very good host.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.319
You're excellent with hospitality.

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:44.470
Vanessa: Thank you.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:49.680
Liz: Obviously we share a love of reading,
so I know that you're very well read.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.220
I like that you get very interested in specific
topics.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.740
Vanessa: Whenever the topic ...
Liz: Whenever we read a book, she's like,

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.079
I went and did research and I found this out
and this and this.

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:00.750
It was just very interesting.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.970
Vanessa: I think that's quite true that when
I'm interested in something, I'm really interested.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:05.100
Liz: You go all the way.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.430
Vanessa: Just go into it.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.430
Yeah.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:08.829
Well, thank you for your kind words.

00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:09.829
Liz: Yes.

00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:10.829
Heather: Vanessa.

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:11.829
Vanessa: Tell me what you think.

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:18.960
Heather: I think you're probably one of the
kindest people I've ever met.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.349
I think you're just very genuinely nice.

00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:22.349
Vanessa: Thanks.

00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:23.800
That's really sweet.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.809
Heather: I could be wrong.

00:37:25.809 --> 00:37:30.330
Vanessa: You know when you're not around,
Heather, I'm evil.

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:35.050
Heather: I think you're also very inquisitive
and very literate.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.099
Vanessa: I like to read.

00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:41.330
Heather: I think you are very curious about
the world and people like this.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:47.569
Heather: I think where you and Dan fit well
together he seems super creative, comes up

00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:51.609
with ideas, but you're very good at implementing
ideas.

00:37:51.609 --> 00:37:53.329
I think you're good at keeping people on task.

00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:54.329
Vanessa: Okay.

00:37:54.329 --> 00:37:55.710
Focusing on the point.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.710
Heather: Yes.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:57.710
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:58.780
Heather: I think you need that.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.760
You run your own business, so I think that
is a good quality.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.760
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760
Got to be able to focus.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760
Heather: Yes.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760
Exactly.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760
Vanessa: That's great.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.319
Heather: I think you are very good at having
fun, but also getting the work done.

00:38:10.319 --> 00:38:12.690
Vanessa: Being serious when I need to be serious.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.690
Heather: Exactly.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:28.440
Lauren: Vanessa is kind and warm and likes
to learn as well, well traveled also, and

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.130
you have pretty brown hair too.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.339
Vanessa: Thank you.

00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:32.339
Dan: Vanessa.

00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:33.369
Vanessa: No pressure.

00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:34.369
I'm your wife.

00:38:34.369 --> 00:38:35.369
I'm sitting right here.

00:38:35.369 --> 00:38:36.800
Dan: Number on adjective is wonderful.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.480
Vanessa: Thank you.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:42.730
Dan: Vanessa is probably the nicest person
on Earth.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:47.160
By nicest, I mean almost just like sincere.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:55.180
She's always very sincere, very caring, very
curious, always sincerely interested in most

00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:00.480
people's topics, like I'll hear even a boring
person say something and she'll be like "Oh

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.950
well, very interesting."

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.650
I don't think she's making it up either.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.930
I think she's seriously very interested.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:07.930
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:08.930
Life is interesting.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.060
Everyone has something interesting if you
listen close enough.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.079
Dan: Yes.

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:14.520
She's also very fun, very fun loving.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.850
You can do a lot with her.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:20.270
Obviously, I like Vanessa a lot because I
decided to marry her.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.930
Vanessa: I'm glad you like me a lot.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:27.730
Dan: We get along very well and I like yeah
about 99% of Vanessa.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.730
Vanessa: Thank you.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.970
I won't ask about the 1% yet.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:35.230
I hope you've enjoyed today's long, intense,
English vocabulary lesson.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:37.420
Now, I have a challenge for you.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.849
In the comments below this video, I want you
to try to write a sentence or two or three

00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:46.390
describing yourself or maybe describing someone
else in your life.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:51.090
Try to fill it with these wonderful adjectives,
some of these are nouns as well, to describe

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.090
yourself.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.920
It's a great way to remember them.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.470
Try to ingrain them in your memory.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.420
