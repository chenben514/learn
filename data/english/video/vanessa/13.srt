Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.640
Are you ready to read a story with me?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's do it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.400
You're invited to story time with my three-year-old
son, Theo.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.730
I'm going to be reading him a classic story,
Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.439
It's from 1939.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.850
And whenever we encounter new vocabulary that
I think would be useful for you, I'm going

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.120
to stop and explain it to you so that you'll
be able to add it to your vocabulary.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.550
If you enjoy reading in English or you'd like
to start reading in English, I'll put a link

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.370
in the description to my top children's books
in English, top books for beginner adults

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.600
in English, and also top books for intermediate
and advanced adults in English.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.910
Check out the link in the description so that
you can continue reading in your own free

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.910
time.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.910
All right.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.910
Are you ready to get started?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.910
Let's read.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.910
All right.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.960
We're going to read Mike Mulligan and His
Steam Shovel, story and pictures by Virginia

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960
Lee Burton.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960
Are you ready, Theo?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.220
Are you ready, Freddie?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.170
All right.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.390
Mike Mulligan had a steam shovel, a beautiful
red steam shovel.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.730
Her name was ...
Theo: Mike Mulligan.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.730
Vanessa: Mike Mulligan.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.730
Mike Mulligan is the man.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.910
Do you remember what his steam shovel's name
is?

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.910
Mary Anne.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.910
Theo: Mary Anne.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.190
Vanessa: That's right.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.190
Mary Anne.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.530
Mike Mulligan was very proud of Mary Anne.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.900
He always said that she could dig as much
in a day as a hundred men could dig in a week,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.740
but he had never been quite sure that this
was true.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.470
You heard the sentence, she could dig as much
in a day as a hundred men could dig in a week.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.070
This is a wonderful comparison expression,
as much as.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.900
We're comparing what Mary Anne can dig and
what a hundred men can dig.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.979
We could also insert the word dirt here, but
it's just implied, so they've taken it out.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.110
You could say she could dig as much dirt in
one day as a hundred men could dig in a week,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.660
but we don't need to say the word dirt.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.069
It's kind of understood a steam shovel usually
digs dirt.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.560
Another example is I drank as much tea as
my dad.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.730
Let's continue.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.550
Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne had been digging
together for years and years.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
Mike Mulligan took such good care of Mary
Anne, she never grew old.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.850
It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some
others who dug the great canals for the big

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.780
boats to sail through.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.650
It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne, and some
others who cut through the high mountains

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.870
so that trains could go through.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.920
You heard Mike Mulligan took such good care
of Mary Anne.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.950
This word such is often used for emphasis.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.040
Wow, that was such a good dinner.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.099
Why would he say such a mean thing to you?

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.490
Let's continue.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.700
It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some
others who lowered the hills and straightened

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.210
the curves to make the long highways for automobiles.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.960
Do you know what automobiles are?
Theo: No.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.210
Vanessa: It's cars.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.099
It's kind of an old fashioned way to say cars.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.209
It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some
others who smoothed out the ground and filled

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.650
in the holes to make the landing fields for
the airplanes.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.400
And it was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and
some others who dug the deep holes for the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.130
sellers of the tall skyscrapers in the big
cities.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.819
When people used to stop and watch them, Mike
Mulligan and Mary Anne used to dig a little

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.879
faster and a little better.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.069
The more people stopped, the faster and better
they dug.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.380
Some days they would keep as many as 37 trucks
busy taking away the dirt they had dug.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.610
You heard the more people stopped, the faster
and better they dug.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.130
I actually devoted an entire English lesson
to this advanced sentence construction with

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.550
the, the, you can check it out up here.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.989
But just for a quick review, we have an action.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.599
The more people stopped.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.200
So people stopping is the action and then
we have the result, which is the faster and

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.840
better Mike and Mary Anne dug.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.040
So we have an action with a result.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.500
But if you'd like to use this in a deeper
way, feel free to click the link up here and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.500
dive into it.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.500
All right.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500
Let's get back to our story.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.009
Then along came the new gasoline shovels and
the new electric shovels and the new diesel

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.809
motor shovels and took all the jobs away from
this team shovels.

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:33.430
Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne were very sad.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.582
Why are you happy?

00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:38.582
Silly boy.

00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:42.229
You heard and then along came the new gasoline
shovels.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.849
This phrasal verb along came can also be used
in the inverse, then came along the new gasoline

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:49.919
shovels.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.889
We use this phrasal verb when something big
or new is appearing or being invented.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:03.389
For example, cassette tapes were pretty popular,
then along came CDs and MP3s.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.389
Cassette tapes were pretty popular, then came
along CDs and MP3s.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.389
Great.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.990
Let's get back to the story.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.949
And all the other steam shovels were being
sold for junk or left out in old gravel pits

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.099
to rust and fall apart.

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.479
Mike loved Mary Anne.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.379
He couldn't do that to her.

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.879
He had taken such good care of her that she
could still dig as much in a day as a hundred

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.789
men could dig in a week.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.080
At least he thought she could, but he wasn't
quite sure.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.939
Everywhere they went the new gas shovels and
the new electric shovels and the new diesel

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.750
motor shovels had all the jobs.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.699
No one wanted Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne
anymore.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.889
Then one day, Mike read in a newspaper that
a town of Popperville was going to build a

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.249
new town hall.

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.319
We're going to dig the cellar of that town
hall, said Mike to Mary Anne.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.199
And off they started.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.399
You heard we are going to dig the cellar of
that town hall, Mike said to Mary Anne.

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.919
And off they started.

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:08.800
This phrasal verb to start off can also be
used in the inverse off they started or and

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.210
they started off.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.930
It generally means that you are starting some
kind of journey.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.830
So we might say we started off our road trip
by listening to some music.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.830
Great.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.090
Let's get back to the story.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.789
They left the canals and the roadways and
the highways and the airports in the big cities

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.469
where no one wanted them anymore and went
away out in the country.

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:35.080
You heard no one wanted them anymore.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.009
I often see this mistake with English learners
that instead of using a negative and a positive,

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.330
no one wanted them anymore.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.180
No one is the negative.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.870
Any more is the positive.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.349
Instead of using a negative and a positive,
I see English learners often using two negatives.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.740
No one wanted them no more.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.819
But in English, this is called a double negative
and it is incorrect and it is also extremely

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:04.979
confusing because in English two negatives
makes a positive.

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:12.699
So if you say I didn't eat no carrots, this
actually means that I ate carrots because

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.229
there's two negatives.

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:16.379
Didn't and no means positive.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.189
It's so confusing in English.

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:22.860
So make sure that when you're using this,
you use a negative and a positive.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.839
Let's look at another quick example.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.539
No one ever has spoken all of the languages
in the world.

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.360
Here, we have a negative, no one, and then
a positive, ever.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.699
No one ever has spoken all the languages in
the world.

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:40.080
You can not say no one never has spoken all
the languages.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.270
It is very confusing.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.270
All right.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.430
Let's get back to the story.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.860
They crawled along slowly up the hills and
down the Hills till they came to the little

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.080
town of ...
Theo: Popperville.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.080
Vanessa: That's right.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.080
Popperville.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.439
When they got there, they found the select
men were just deciding who should dig the

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:01.469
cellar for the new town hall.

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:03.379
Mike Mulligan spoke to Henry B. Swap.

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:04.509
One of the select men.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:08.729
I heard, he said, that you are going to build
a new town hall.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:13.789
Mary Anne and I will dig the seller for you
in just one day.

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:18.099
What, said Henry B. Swap, dig a cellar in
a day?

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:22.909
It would take a hundred men at least a week
to dig the cellar for our new town hall.

00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:28.999
Sure, said Mike, but Mary Anne can dig as
much in a day as a hundred men can dig in

00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:32.490
a week, though he had never been quite sure
that this was true.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.960
Then he added, if we can't do it, you won't
have to pay.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.490
Henry B. Swap thought this would be an easy
way to get part of the cellar dug for nothing.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.720
So he smiled in a rather mean way and gave
the job of digging the cellar of the new town

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.660
hall to Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.510
You heard it would take at least a week for
a hundred men to dig our seller.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.110
It would take, this is a hypothetical situation.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.950
We often use the word if in these types of
sentences.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.410
If I ate cookies every day, I would gain weight.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.700
This is a hypothetical situation.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.740
So the word would is essential.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.780
All right.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.820
Let's continue.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.580
They started in early the next morning just
as the sun was coming up.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.710
Soon, a little boy came along.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.750
Do you think you will finish by sundown?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.240
He said to Mike Mulligan.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.670
Sure, said Mike.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:29.840
If you stay and watch us, we always work faster
and better when someone is watching us.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.950
So the little boy stayed to watch.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.270
Then Mrs. McGillicuddy, Henry B. Swap, and
the town constable came over to see what was

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.760
happening and they stayed to watch.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:45.300
Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dug a little faster
and a little better.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.200
This gave the little boy a good idea.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.990
He ran off and told the postman with the morning
mail, the telegraph boy on his bicycle, the

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.270
milkman with his cart and horse, the doctor
on his way home and the farmer and his family

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.700
coming into town for the day, and they all
stopped and stayed to watch.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.690
That made Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dig
a little faster and a little better.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:11.700
They finished the first corner neat and square,
but the sun was getting higher.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.770
You heard, they came over to see what was
happening.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.990
This is a lovely phrasal verb, to come over.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.930
You might say that during the lockdown, no
one came over to my house.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.590
It just means to arrive at my house.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.590
No one came over to my house.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.150
If you'd like to see seven expressions using
the word come, check out this lesson that

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.980
I made up here to expand your vocabulary.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.980
All right.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.980
Let's get back to the story.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.240
Clang, clang clang, the fire department arrived.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.540
They had seen the smoke and thought there
was a fire.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.520
Then the little boy said, why don't you stay
in watch?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.620
So the fire department of Popperville stayed
to watch Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.320
When they heard the fire engine, the children
in the school across the street couldn't keep

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.150
their eyes on their lessons.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.640
The teacher called a long recess and the whole
school came out to watch.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.500
That made Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne digs
still faster and still better.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:09.100
They finished the second corner neat and square,
but the sun was right up in the top of the

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.100
sky.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.470
We're going to be talking about two expressions
that you heard on this page.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.740
The first one is the sentence, why don't you
stay and watch?

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:24.330
This expression why don't you is a polite
but very direct suggestion.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.170
It's no problem to use this with friends,
but I wouldn't really recommend using it with

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.120
your boss because you don't really want to
tell your boss what to do.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.660
Why don't you look at this report?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.430
It's a little too pushy.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.430
But with friends, it's no problem.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.760
Why don't you stay for dinner?

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.600
I'm making some soup and I would love to share
it with you.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.810
Why don't you stay?

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:49.220
But what happens if we use this phrase with
a harsh tone of voice?

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.480
Why don't you ever pick up your socks?

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.980
All a sudden, it's not a polite suggestion.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.060
Instead, it's an accusing tone of voice.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.330
Why don't you ever pick up your socks?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:06.440
So you can use this why don't you expression
in a polite way just to make a suggestion

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.090
or in a harsher way, depending on the tone
of your voice.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.450
So make sure that the tone matches what you
want to say.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:19.300
The second sentence that I want to talk about
from this page is the children in the school,

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.620
across the street, couldn't keep their eyes
on their lessons.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:30.100
To keep your eyes on something means that
you're focusing on something, but it's often

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.360
used in the negative.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.670
Just like it was in the sentence.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.400
To not keep your eyes on something.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.470
It means you can't focus.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.550
They couldn't keep their eyes on their lessons.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:45.260
For example, when my husband is watching TV,
I can't keep my eyes on my book.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.450
It's hard for me to focus on my book when
the TV is on.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.130
But what happens if we change the last word
of this phrase?

00:12:53.130 --> 00:13:00.190
What if instead of to keep your eyes on something,
we say to keep your eyes off something?

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:06.170
Suddenly, it has the opposite meaning that
you can't stop focusing.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.500
Let's look at an example.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.030
The children couldn't keep their eyes off
of Mike Mulligan.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.300
This means that they wanted to focus on Mike
Mulligan.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.890
Hopefully, you can't keep your eyes off of
this lesson.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.790
You want to keep watching it.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:26.960
Or we might say I can't keep my eyes off the
TV when my husband is watching it.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.290
We've got some lovely phrases on this page.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.290
All right.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.340
Let's get back to the story.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:37.180
Now, the girl who answers the telephone called
up the next towns of Bangerville and Bopperville

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.560
and Kipperville and Copperville and told them
what was happening in Popperville.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.650
All the people came over to see if Mike Mulligan
and his steam shovel could dig the cellar

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.120
in just one day.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.500
The more people came, the faster Mike Mulligan
and Mary Anne dug, but they would have to

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.500
hurry.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.630
They were only halfway through and the sun
was beginning to go down.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.960
You heard the sun was just going down behind
the hill.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.060
We could also say the sun is coming up.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.240
We use these two phrasal verbs, the sun is
going down, the sun is coming up, on a regular

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.240
basis.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.750
You can also say the sun is rising in the
morning or the sun is coming up in the morning.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.270
Or you might say the sun is setting at night.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.440
The sun is going down at night.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.190
All of these are used commonly in daily conversation.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.730
They finished the third corner neat and square.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:35.880
Oh boy, never had Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne
had so many people to watch them, never had

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.970
they dug so fast and so well and never had
the sun seemed to go down so fast.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.610
Hurry, Mike Mulligan.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.610
Hurry.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.320
Hurry, shouted the little boy.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320
There's not much more time.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.740
Dirt was flying everywhere.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.210
The smoke and steam were so thick that people
could hardly see anything.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:15:00.350
But listen, bang, bang, crash, slam, louder,
louder, faster, and faster.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.710
Then suddenly it was quiet slowly.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:09.160
The dirt settled down and the smoke and steam
cleared away and there was the cellar all

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.570
finished.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:16.300
Four corners neat and square, four walls straight
down, and Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne at the

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.300
bottom.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.720
And the sun was just going down behind the
hill.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.520
Hooray, shouted the people.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.440
Hooray for Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.570
They have dug the cellar in just one day.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:34.020
Suddenly, the little boy said, how are they
going to get out?

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.180
That's right, said Mrs. McGillicuddy to Henry
B. Swap.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.690
How is he going to get his steam shovel out?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.100
Henry B. Swap didn't answer, but he smiled
in a rather mean way.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.460
Then everybody said, how are they going to
get out?

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.130
Mike Mulligan, how are you going to get your
steam shovel out?

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:58.670
Mike Mulligan looked around at the four square
walls and the four square corners and he said,

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:04.690
we've dug so fast and so well that we've quite
forgotten to leave a way out.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.790
Uh-oh, nothing like this had ever happened
to Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne before and

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.490
they didn't know what to do.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.480
You just heard nothing like this had ever
happened to them before.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.420
Does this sentence construction sound familiar?

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.270
I wanted to review it because it is essential.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.090
We have a negative word, nothing.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.510
And then later in the sentence, we have a
positive word, ever.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.990
Nothing like this had ever happened to them
before.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.910
I hope that this helps to reinforce this concept.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.910
All right.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.910
Let's go back to the story.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.770
Nothing like this had ever happened before
in Popperville.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.810
Everybody started talking at once and everybody
had a different idea and everybody thought

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.200
his idea was the best.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.180
They talked and they talked and they argued
and they fought until they were worn out and

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.930
still no one knew how to get Mike Mulligan
and Mary Anne out of the cellar they had dug.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.750
Then Henry B. Swap said the job isn't finished
because Mary Anne isn't out of the seller,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.550
so Mike Mulligan won't get paid.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.150
And he smiled again in a rather mean way.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:09.380
Now the little boy who had been keeping very
quiet had another good idea.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.029
He said, why couldn't we leave Mary Anne in
the seller and build the new town hall above

00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:15.029
her.

00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:18.949
Let her be the furnace for the new town hall
and let Mike Mulligan be the janitor, then

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:22.539
you wouldn't have to buy a new furnace and
we could pay Mike Mulligan for digging the

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:25.079
seller in just one day.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.820
You heard the little boy who had been keeping
quiet had another good idea.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.009
This expression to keep quiet means to remain
quiet.

00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:37.999
We often use the word, keep, to talk about
something that's continuing.

00:17:37.999 --> 00:17:42.250
To keep quiet, to stay quiet or remain quiet.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.520
You might also say I can't keep quiet anymore.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.631
I need to tell the world that I love you.

00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:53.289
Do you also in this sentence, we are really
emphasizing this point, the negative and the

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:54.470
positive words?

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.919
I can't, that's a negative word, keep quiet
anymore.

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:01.159
Any is a positive word.

00:18:01.159 --> 00:18:02.899
So here we have a negative and a positive.

00:18:02.899 --> 00:18:04.860
I can't keep quiet anymore.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.899
I need to tell the world that I love you.

00:18:06.899 --> 00:18:07.899
All right.

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:09.100
Let's go back to this story.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.100
Why not?

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.509
Said Henry B. Swap and smiled in a way that
was not quite so mean.

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:14.509
Why not?

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:15.509
Said Mrs. McGillicuddy.

00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:16.509
Why not?

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:17.509
Said the town constable.

00:18:17.509 --> 00:18:18.509
Why not?

00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:19.509
Said all the people.

00:18:19.509 --> 00:18:23.769
So they found a ladder and climbed down into
the cellar to ask Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.769
Why not?

00:18:24.769 --> 00:18:25.769
Said Mike Mulligan.

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:28.230
And so it was decided and everybody was happy.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.970
You heard why not?

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.690
Said Henry B. Swap.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.029
Even though this seems like a negative question
because there's the word not, really it's

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:38.730
just another way to say, sure.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:44.600
It really implies I don't see a reason why
we shouldn't do it, so okay.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600
Why not?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.799
They built the new town hall right over Mike
Mulligan and Mary Anne.

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:51.220
It was finished before winter.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.340
Every day, the little boy goes over to see
Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and Mrs. McGillicuddy

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.610
takes him nice hot apple pies.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.399
And Henry B. swap spends most of his time
in the cellar of the new town hall listening

00:19:02.399 --> 00:19:08.570
to the stories that Mike Mulligan has to tell
and smiling in a way that isn't mean at all.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:14.730
Now when you, Theo, and you, Freddy, go to
Popperville to go in the cellar of the new

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.230
town hall, there there'll be, Mike Mulligan
and Mary Anne.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.249
Mike in his rocking chair smoking his pipe
and Mary Anne beside him warming up the meetings

00:19:24.249 --> 00:19:26.830
in the new town hall.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:27.830
The end.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.730
I hope you enjoyed this story of Mike Mulligan
and his steam shovel and also the added vocabulary

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.869
that you can learn from even a simple kid
story.

00:19:35.869 --> 00:19:42.190
I think my three-year-old doesn't quite understand
why Mary Anne isn't needed anymore as a steam

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.730
shovel and why she has to become a furnace.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.990
Someday, he'll understand that it's okay.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:51.389
He just likes this story because there are
construction trucks in it.

00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:56.149
So if you would like to check out some other
kids stories or books for adults that I recommend,

00:19:56.149 --> 00:20:00.889
make sure you check out the link in the description
so that you can continue reading in English.

00:20:00.889 --> 00:20:02.789
And now I have a question for you.

00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:06.200
What kind of books did you like to read as
a child?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.039
Do you have any children's book recommendations?

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:12.220
I love to check out books for kids from around
the world.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.149
It would be quite interesting to me and maybe
my kids would like it too.

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:19.879
Well, thanks so much for learning with me
and I'll see you again next week on Friday

00:20:19.879 --> 00:20:24.450
for a new lesson here on my YouTube channel.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.450
Bye.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:30.350
Theo is getting paid for helping with my YouTube
channel, with my business.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.350
Dan: Really?

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.230
Vanessa: What am I going to pay you with?

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.970
Am I going to give you money?
