Vanessa: Hello, hello.

Thank you so much for joining me.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.980
I'm here with my husband, Dan.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.980
Dan: Hello.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.260
Vanessa: And we're going to having a natural
conversation about emotions today, so I hope

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.270
that you'll learn some new words.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.310
If we use any new expressions we're going
to explain them as we go.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.610
It's going to be pretty spontaneous.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.120
We have a couple questions to talk about,
but it's not so planned, so I hope that your

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.070
listening skills will be tested and you'll
just have a good time.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.720

I'm glad that you're joining from all around

from Poland, from France, from Indonesia.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.430
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.060
I'd like to start with a question for Dan.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.570
Dan: We're going to talk about being emotional.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.380
Vanessa: Yes, having emotions, because everyone
has emotions.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.380
Dan: I don't know.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.060
Vanessa: We'll see, we'll see.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.900
I thought we'd start with positive emotion
question.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.400
I want to know what something that makes you
feel excited.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400
Dan: Excited?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.710
Vanessa: Yes, yes.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.160
Dan: Well, the first thing that came to my
mind was food.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.160
Vanessa: I agree.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.590
Dan: I mean, food is so exciting.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.610
If you're really hungry and you see a hamburger
in front of you, you get really, really excited.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.430
Vanessa: I want to know, do you get excited
by food?

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.170
So in this sentence that Dan just said, he
said, "I get excited by" something.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.630
"I get excited by food."

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.980
Or, "I get excited when I see food."

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.009
So what about for you, can you make a sentence
using this sentence structure?

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.489
For me, I get excited when I smell delicious
food.

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.489
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.509
Vanessa: It's really exciting for me.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.480
In fact, a couple days ago I was cleaning
out my closet and I found an old journal that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.319
I wrote when I was seven years old.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.189
Dan: Did you write a poem to food?

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.959
Vanessa: I wrote a lot about food.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.450
I think every-
Dan: Dear pizza, I love you with all my heart.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.980
Vanessa: It was almost like that.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.069
I wrote about apples, I wrote about ice cream,
I wrote about lots of food because as a kid,

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.739
I don't know, it's exciting, right?

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.810
Dan: You know, when I was looking at your
journals I remember you were very excited

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.860
about boys.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.909
Vanessa: Oh.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.599
Dan: She had her little boyfriends.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.319
They weren't really boyfriends, she was viewing
them from afar.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.620
Vanessa: Just from afar, just from afar.
Dan: Yes.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.069
She would say, one journal said, "And you
were looking at you know who."

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.069
Vanessa: Oh.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.739
Dan: I don't know who that was.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.040
Vanessa: So can you explain what "you know
who" means?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.790
We're getting to another question here, which
is about embarrassment.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.790
I feel embarrassed.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.790
Dan: Yeah.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.699
But "you know who" just means you don't want
to say who it is, so it's a secret.

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:18.029
Its kind of like in Harry Potter, have you
ever read Harry Potter where the book says,

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.620
"He who shall not be named?"

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.120
Vanessa: Oh, so in Harry Potter-
Dan: But it's kind of the opposite of that,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.120
it's not a bad guy.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.419
Vanessa: It's not a bad guy, but it's someone
who's secret, you're trying to not say their

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.419
name.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.260
So in Harry Potter, Voldemort, you're not
supposed to say his name, so they might say,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.790
"Oh, I see you know who."

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.250
And that just means you don't want to say
his name.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.239
So you could say this for someone you're talking
about but you don't really want to say their

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.239
name specifically.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.379
And just to let you know, any vocabulary words
that we discuss and talk about, after this

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.069
live lesson is finished I'm going to write
them in the description below this live lesson

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.439
so that you can go down and check them, see
the sentence that we used, and kind of get

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.859
a better picture for them, because I know
we're going to be talking fast, and talking

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.159
about a lot of things.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.010
So I hope that that will be useful to you.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.859
Alright, so let's get started with a more
serious question.

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.840
I want to know, what's something that annoys
you.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
Dan: Serious.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.840
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.070
Dan: Something that annoys me?

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.070
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.180
Dan: That seriously annoys me?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.620
Vanessa: Oh it could be something that's kind
of silly that annoys you, but it's not so

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.080
happy, it's not excited, you're not happy
about it.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080
Something that annoys you.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.949
Dan: A simple thing that annoys me is we used
to have this fan in our living room, and the

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:42.120
fan would be spinning and it would make a
clicking sound, it would go, "Click, click,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.380
click, click," over, and over, and over again.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.000
And I could not take that sound, it was so
annoying, so I had to turn it off, and then

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
we were hot.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Vanessa: It was hot in our house.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.349
Dan: At night, I would rather be hot than
hear that sound over and over again.

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.389
Vanessa: So the fan annoyed you.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.389
Dan: Yes.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.860
Vanessa: And you used a great phrasal verb,
"I can't take it."

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.759
Dan: Yeah, I couldn't take it.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.759
Vanessa: Yes.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.289
What does it mean if you say, "My job is so
annoying, I can't take it anymore."

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.631
Dan: Yeah, that means you're about to leave
the job, or turn something off, or just stop

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:17.370
it, go away.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.759
You know, you can't take it.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.319
Vanessa: Yeah, I kind of have this image in
my mind of your patience.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.780
Your patience is lowering, and lowering, and
lowering and then all of a sudden you don't

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.449
have any more patience, that's when you can't
take it.

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.449
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.599
Vanessa: Like, "I've tried to be patient,
I tried to be patient," and then, "I can't

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.599
take it!"

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:35.599
Dan: Yeah.

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.250
Do you find me annoying?

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.590
Vanessa: I wouldn't say ... Not usually.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.849
Dan: Well you can't really be married to somebody,
well you could, but it wouldn't be a fun marriage.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.740
Vanessa: Yeah, I think that when there's things
that you do that annoy me, I usually just

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.960
tell you right away.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.969
Like, "Hey, stop tapping," when he drums on
tables and I'm trying to concentrate, "Stop

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.490
tapping, I need to focus."

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.270
I tell you, I think pretty directly.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.270
Dan: Yeah.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.360
Vanessa: Do you think so?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.360
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360
Vanessa: Okay.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360
Dan: You're very direct.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.430
Vanessa: Especially when-
Dan: You're not very annoying though.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.430
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.970
Dan: Yeah, she's not annoying ever.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.259
Vanessa: That's good.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.900
Dan: She's kind of perfect really.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.569
Vanessa: Well you're a little biased.

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.009
Dan: I am a little biased.

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.889
Vanessa: Well let's go to the second question.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:21.889
Dan: Okay.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.110
Vanessa: My second question is, have you ever
felt down in the dumps?

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:35.680
This is an idiom, but I think we can explain
it in a ... Just a quick sense, how would

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.720
you explain "down in the dumps?"

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.169
Dan: That means depressed.

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.539
Maybe close to depressed.

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:44.979
Vanessa: You're not-
Dan: You're very, very sad.

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.000
Vanessa: You're not clinically depressed,
you're not taking medication, but you're really

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
sad.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Dan: You're very, very, very sad.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.180
So this is a kind of more serious question,
but-

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.050
Dan: I know, this is going to get dark.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.439
Vanessa: Have you ever felt down in the dumps?

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:01.699
And I want to know for you, have you ever
felt down in the dumps?

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:07.360
Dan: I know that we've been down in the dumps
because we were long distance before.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.009
Vanessa: Can you explain what that means?

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.009
Dan: Yeah.

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:15.050
So if you're in a long distance relationship,
you don't live close by.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.470
Vanessa: It's so hard.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.690
Dan: So she was in France and I was in the
United States and we were-

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.620
Vanessa: Or I was in South Carolina and you
were in Tennessee, we're six hours apart.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.160
Then we were an ocean apart for three years.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.319
Dan: Yeah, so when I was down in the dumps
the most it was probably in college when we

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.099
separated.

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:40.730
We were still dating, but we didn't see each
other very much, and I had no friends, and

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:47.180
I was living alone, and it was a new school,
and I watching YouTube videos for the first

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.020
time about conspiracy theories.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.830
Vanessa: And you just go down that-
Dan: And I went down a rabbit trail.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.830
Vanessa: Sad spiral.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.659
Dan: Which I don't believe in conspiracy theories.

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:57.650
Vanessa: But, it was a difficult time for
you?

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.900
Dan: Back them I thought the world was upside
down.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.900
Vanessa: Oh no.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.569
So this idiom, "down in the dumps," what is
a dump?

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.970
So we can kind of get this visual image of
dumps.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.100
Dan: I kind of assumed it meant garbage.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.249
Vanessa: Yeah, that's what I would say.

00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:16.249
Dan: Trash.

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:17.909
Vanessa: When you say-
Dan: I'm in the trash.

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:22.020
Vanessa: Yeah, you kind of imagine you're
in this really terrible place, it's where

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.340
people take their old couches, or their trash,
and this is called "the dump."

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:33.540
So when I was little I remember my dad would
say if he had something that the trash man

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.639
wouldn't take, maybe some big item or something
like that, he would often ask me, "Vanessa,

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:40.810
do you want to go to the dump with me?"

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:46.579
And I don't know why, but that was so fun
for me because it was out in the country,

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:52.280
and we got to drive on these fun roads, and
then we got to throw things into this big

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280
hole.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280
Dan: Oo, yeah.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.779
Vanessa: Which is always fun.

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:58.750
So this is the literal dump, D-U-M-P.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:05.470
We would go to the dump, but if you are figuratively
down in the dumps, down in the dumps.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.670
It means you're sad?

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.460
Dan: Yeah, have you been down in the dumps?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.360
Vanessa: Yeah, I think that the times that
I've been down in the dumps has been in serious

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.740
situations like family problems, or when we
were separated, those kind of relational deep

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.740
things.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.350
I feel like I don't get down in the dumps
for small things.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.830
Dan: Yeah, or-
Vanessa: Some people do.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.180
Dan: Or for very long.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.380
I've never seen Vanessa sad for a long time.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.690
Vanessa: Mm, I feel like-
Dan: She usually gets happy pretty quickly.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.519
Vanessa: Well it's hard for me to maintain
always-

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:37.760
Dan: Sorrow.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.540
Vanessa: Yeah, always being sad.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:45.720
I can have a hurt inside that lingers for
awhile, but I think that constantly, when

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.130
I got to the store, being sad with the cashier,
when I come home and I'm cooking dinner, being

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.290
sad, when I talk with Dan- I can't keep it
up for that long.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.170
I might feel sad inside and-
Dan: She can't keep a smile away honestly,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.520
it just comes.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:06.930
Vanessa: Well let's go to the third question,
which is, do you get easily embarrassed?

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.140
Here I'm using a "get" expression plus an
adjective, "get embarrassed."

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.959
Get happy, get hungry, get thirsty.

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:16.120
But this one is get embarrassed.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.300
So do you get easily embarrassed?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.300
Dan: No.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.680
Vanessa: That's what I thought you'd say.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.320
Dan: Yeah, not really.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:30.790
Maybe if I'm thinking about going to a party,
or seeing friends, maybe I get a little nervous

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.220
that I'll say something silly, or dumb, or
I don't know.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:40.320
But when I'm actually in a situation with
people and I say something, I'll say almost

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.820
anything and maybe it's kind of silly, and
I don't feel embarrassed.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.970
Vanessa: I feel like you're the kind of person
who has a very low embarrassment level.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.920
Dan: Maybe high.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.480
Vanessa: You don't often get embarrassed.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.940
Dan: I don't often get embarrassed.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.649
Vanessa: But, you can-
Dan: I say a lot of embarrassing things though.

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:03.339
Vanessa: You can inadvertently make other
people feel embarrassed.

00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:07.889
And inadvertently means you're not trying
to, but you just do.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:11.510
I remember one time when we were ... This
isn't so serious, but I remember one time

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:18.220
we were living in Korea and one of our good
friends was walking along the road, the sidewalk

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.540
with us, and you just did something simple,
something I'm used to, I didn't think anything

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.540
about it.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:30.491
You just like, jumped up on this brick wall
and just went, "Yay, I'm so happy," or you

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:35.820
just did something kind of silly, and she
said, "Dan, what are you doing?

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.139
That's so crazy."

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:38.220
But for you, it was nothing.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.520
Dan: "You're so crazy."

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.310
Vanessa: It was nothing, it wasn't that crazy.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.149
But for her, she was embarrassed by your actions.

00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:47.180
Dan: Yeah.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:53.760
Vanessa: I would say a moment ago when you
were talking about my journals, I felt a little

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.760
embarrassed.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.760
Dan: Talking about ex-boyfriends.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.860
Vanessa: I felt a little embarrassed, but
I think that that's ... For me, it's easy

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.480
to see when I'm embarrassed because I easily
blush.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.890
Dan: I do too a little bit.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:07.890
Vanessa: A little bit?

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.370
Dan: Last night I got a little embarrassed.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.370
Vanessa: Last night?

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.370
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.370
Vanessa: What happened last night?

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.639
Dan: I said something at trivia.

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:16.660
Vanessa: Oh, we went with our friends and
you said something embarrassing.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.660
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.710
I got a little embarrassed, but not ... It
wasn't a big deal.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.790
Vanessa: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.940
Dan: I didn't have to walk away and cry.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.940
Vanessa: Oh, sure.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.750
Should I share with everyone why you were
embarrassed?

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.910
Dan: What did I say?

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.910
I don't remember.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.350
Vanessa: I remember-
Dan: I've already erased it from my memory.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:37.509
Vanessa: This is our trivia team, and trivia
is kind of like a game show.

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:45.010
We go to a restaurant or a bar and our team,
which is just our friends, with other teams,

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.250
we have to answer some questions correctly
about music-

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.250
Dan: Trivial things.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.190
Vanessa: Or history, things that aren't really
important.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.970
That's why it's called "trivia," trivial,
it's not important.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:02.509
But one of the questions was, "TV show theme
songs."

00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:03.731
Dan: Oh, I do remember this now.

00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:07.061
Vanessa: So our team didn't know-
Dan: It's a little embarrassing.

00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:10.670
Vanessa: Didn't know the TV show theme song,
and Dan knew it.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.670
The theme song was for?

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.779
Dan: Baywatch.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:17.420
Vanessa: And Baywatch is just a silly-
Dan: It's a stupid soap opera.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.440
Vanessa: A silly show, and Dan was embarrassed
that he knew the theme song.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440
Dan: Yeah.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.899
It's about women in swim suits.

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:24.899
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:27.639
Dan: Running, they're saving people, and it's
really dumb.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:29.202
Vanessa: So you felt embarrassed that you
knew that.

00:13:29.202 --> 00:13:31.920
Dan: But I never really watched it.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.339
Not much, I just knew the theme song for some
reason.

00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:35.339
Was I right?

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:36.339
Vanessa: Yeah, you were right.

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:37.339
Dan: I was right.

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:38.339
Vanessa: Yeah, you were right.

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:39.339
Dan: I know Baywatch.

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:40.880
Vanessa: It was that, and you said-
Dan: Go watch from Baywatch.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.699
Vanessa: Yeah, sometimes if you know something
but you feel a little bit embarrassed that

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.519
you know it, it's a great way to use this.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:49.931
"I feel embarrassed because I shouldn't have
known that.

00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:51.250
That was a little weird."

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.350
Dan: Yeah.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.930
When were you the most embarrassed?

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:54.930
Vanessa: Oh, the most embarrassed?

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.509
Dan: What's the most embarrassing thing that
ever happened?

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:03.519
Vanessa: I feel like a lot of times I tried
to just brush it off and pretend like I'm

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:07.690
not embarrassed, but really inside I am embarrassed.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:14.540
So, maybe I'll laugh or smile, sometimes that's
my go to, or maybe I'll just change the subject

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.050
or say something like, "Oh, that's interesting.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.500
Well, let's look at this."

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.209
Or just kind of divert attention to something
else.

00:14:23.209 --> 00:14:24.209
Dan: Yeah.

00:14:24.209 --> 00:14:26.449
You can't think of one moment though?

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.500
Vanessa: I feel like-
Dan: I can.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.500
Vanessa: Oh, you can?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.732
Dan: Should I tell you mine?

00:14:30.732 --> 00:14:31.732
Vanessa: Oh, you're going to tell about when
I was embarrassed?

00:14:31.732 --> 00:14:33.410
Dan: No, no, when I was embarrassed.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.709
Vanessa: Okay, okay, go ahead.

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:35.819
Dan: My story's easy.

00:14:35.819 --> 00:14:36.819
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

00:14:36.819 --> 00:14:39.190
Dan: Yeah, I was in college and I was doing
a presentation.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.029
Vanessa: Oh, okay, yeah.

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:42.029
You should talk about this.

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:48.379
Dan: Yeah, I had a presentation in front of
the whole class and I didn't sleep that night.

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:53.379
I got up to do my presentation and I forgot
everything.

00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:56.220
And then I had to leave the room, that was
very embarrassing.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.220
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.240
Dan: Maybe the most embarrassing thing that
ever happened to me.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.950
Vanessa: That would be really embarrassing.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.300
Dan: That was bad.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.620
Vanessa: I wasn't in the room when that happened,
but you could say-

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.899
Dan: I think I called you afterwards.

00:15:07.899 --> 00:15:09.640
Vanessa: I think so to.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.959
Dan: "It's so embarrassing."

00:15:11.959 --> 00:15:18.329
Vanessa: If I were in the room, I could say
I was embarrassed for you.

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:24.029
So this means Dan is embarrassed, but I feel
embarrassed because he feels embarrassed.

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:28.579
So you're kind of connecting your feelings,
"I feel embarrassed because he feels embarrassed."

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:30.440
Dan: Yeah, everybody felt sorry for me.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.170
Vanessa: Oh, that's a great expression, can
you explain that?

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.170
Dan: Yeah.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.050
That's kind of what you were saying, I felt
bad and they felt bad too.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.100
So they felt sorry for me, so both of us felt
bad.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.100
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:49.240
So if someone has something bad happen to
them, so let's imagine that you are in an

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.199
English class, and you're trying to give a
presentation, but then you get up in front

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:58.920
of the class and you feel so nervous that
you can't say anything, and you just.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.370
And then the teacher says, "Why don't you
sit down and try again?"

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.661
Dan: This is basically what happened.

00:16:04.661 --> 00:16:05.690
Vanessa: Happened to Dan.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.690
Dan: Yeah.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.029
Vanessa: But you're a native English speaker,
so it can happen to anyone.

00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:15.399
So the other students might say, "I feel sorry
for you.

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:18.240
I feel sorry that that happened."

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.500
Because they're kind of sharing your embarrassment
or sharing your sadness, it doesn't even have

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.790
to be embarrassment, it could just be sadness.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.970
"I'm sorry.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.620
I feel sorry for you because something sad
happened."

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.689
It's just a sharing of feelings.

00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:37.620
Alright, so my next question is about a negative
and a positive emotion.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:43.160
So I want to know when you're feeling stressed,
what do you do to relax?

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.850
Before we talk about it I just want to mention
the grammar here.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:53.639
When you say, "When I feel stressed," stress
has an -ed at the end.

00:16:53.639 --> 00:17:00.399
I know that we often say, "I have stress,"
but it's pretty common to say, "I feel stressed,"

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.639
stressed.

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:05.390
So make sure that when you say stressed there's
a T sound at the end.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.150
"I feel stressed.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.210
When I feel stressed I punch a wall.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.740
When I feel stressed I go for a walk."

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.740
Dan: She does.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.950
Vanessa: As you can see.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.050
Dan: So stressed.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.400
Vanessa: So what are things that you do when
you feel stressed to feel more relaxed?

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.250
Dan: I would say the best thing to do, for
me, is to go outside.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.250
Vanessa: Oh.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.250
Dan: Somewhere.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.250
Vanessa: I'm curious why do you think that
works?

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.720
Because I feel like a lot of people say that,
"When I feel stressed I go outside."

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.640
Dan: Well, especially because I tend to look
at a screen a lot-

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.640
Vanessa: Mm, a lot of people do.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.780
Dan: So maybe I'm looking at my computer,
and then I'll look at my phone, and then I'm

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:47.570
reading all kinds of posts about everything,
I'm reading new stories about politics, and

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.820
I'm just getting overwhelmed.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.140
And that's after work already, you know?

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.480
So, if you go outside and you don't bring
your phone, then it's just you and sky, and

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:04.190
the trees, and I'm climbing a mountain now,
I'm not doing anything that's too mentally

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.190
anguishing.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.190
Vanessa: Sure.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:11.320
I feel like for me, going outside definitely
helps, and I think that it helps because it

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.530
kind of gives me a bigger perspective.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:21.140
I remember one time, something happened on
my website, and for me, I'm an English teacher,

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:28.460
I want to teach English, technology is interesting
to me, and it's a challenge for me, but when

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:34.050
something goes wrong I can easily feel stressed
or overwhelmed by it because I don't easily

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.030
know the solution.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:41.340
I had some problem with my website and I was
feeling stressed and I just walked out of

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:47.580
this room where I make lessons and Dan, you
said, "Let's go for a walk.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.580
Let's just walk."

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.220
And when we walked around the neighborhood,
it was like, 15 minutes, but I felt so much

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.220
better.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.140
I just looked around and thought, "There is
a world outside my website.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.940
There's trees, there's people walking around."

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.010
Dan: It helps to move too, some movement
Vanessa: Yeah, you just have a bigger perspective

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.130
of things going on.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.980
Maybe for you, when you're looking at bad
things happening in the world, or politics

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.600
you feel like that's everything.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.650
Dan: It's easy to feel stressed nowadays.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.020
Thank you, social media.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:22.470
Vanessa: So when you want to feel relaxes,
getting away from that is really helpful.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.390
And nature is really nice for that.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.390
You know something funny?

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.840
It works for our baby too.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.830
Dan: Oh yeah, he likes being outside a lot.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.830
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:39.400
Whenever he's fussy or crying, when we walk
outside, instantly he seems just curious and

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.040
aware.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.300
It works, that's amazing.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.110
So, it's a good tip if you're feeling stressed
about learning English.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.470
Dan: Nature is good for you, yeah.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.020
Vanessa: Yeah, go outside, take a deep breath.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.290
Dan: Stop and smell the roses.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.020
Vanessa: Stop and smell the roses, yes.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.670
This is a good English proverb, maybe there's
something similar in your language as well.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.690
Dan: Stop and pet a cat.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.690
Vanessa: Pet a cat, yeah.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.390
What does "Stop and smell the roses actually
mean?"

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.020
Because maybe there's no roses.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.450
What does this figuratively mean?

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:14.020
Dan: It means stop being distracted by everything
or worried about everything and appreciate

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.020
the small things.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.020
Vanessa: Mm, yeah.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.020
Appreciate the small things.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.630
Dan: Notice the small things around you.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.110
Vanessa: Yeah, I think-
Dan: Or, simple pleasures.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.840
Vanessa: Yeah, that's especially what I think.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.960
Taking time to slow down and notice the things
around you.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960
Dan: Yeah.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.280
Vanessa: In fact, we just finished reading
a book about a girl who had a lot of stress

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:41.490
in her life, and at the end of the book her
ideas changed, her mental health changed.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:47.160
When she was getting healthier, she walked
outside and she noticed all those little details.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.540
She noticed the people walking on the streets,
their dogs, the flowers, the shops.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.221
She noticed those details and I think that
that-

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.221
Dan: And smiled about them.

00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:58.221
Vanessa: Yeah, and smiled about them.

00:20:58.221 --> 00:20:59.221
Dan: Got to smile.

00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:00.530
Vanessa: Really appreciating those things.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.260
Sure, sometimes even just a simple smile can
help.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.050
But stress is certainly no fun.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:12.380
Well, thank you Dan, for talking about all
of these emotions today.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.380
Dan: You're welcome.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.380
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.510
Excitement, annoying, down in the dumps-
Dan: We didn't talk about anger though.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.510
Vanessa: Oh, anger.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.510
Do you want to talk about anger?

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.450
Dan: I'm so angry that we aren't talking about
anger.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.450
Vanessa: Alright.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.450
Well, we just did.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.450
Dan: Not really.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.170
Vanessa: Well-
Dan: We don't get angry anyways.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.390
Vanessa: Mm.
Dan: We're above angry.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.380
Vanessa: Mm, hmm, I think everyone gets angry.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.600
It's good to get angry about things that you
should be angry about, I think.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.600
Dan: True.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.300
Vanessa: Like I'm angry that there is injustice
in the world.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:49.410
I'm angry that people mistreat children, or
mistreat their dogs.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.570
It's good to be angry about those things,
but you can't let it really get you down in

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.270
the dumps for long.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.370
But I think there's a time and a place for
anger.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.370
Dan: For sure.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.370
Vanessa: Yes.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.790
