00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.320
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.760
Are you ready to learn a&nbsp;
secret? Let's talk about it.&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.400
Today, you are going to learn the number one&nbsp;
secret guaranteed to help you speak English&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.200
fluently in only 30 days. That's right, in only&nbsp;
30 days you will know everything you need to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.640
to be able to speak fluently, and dazzle&nbsp;
other people with your amazing English skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.280
Are you ready to learn the number&nbsp;
one secret? Stay tuned to find out.&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.240
Okay, here it is. Are you ready? The secret is...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.880
What did you think I was going to say? Is there&nbsp;
a secret to learning English fluently in 30 days?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.040
No, there is no secret that can&nbsp;
guarantee that you will learn English&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.840
in only 30 days. A lot of programs make this bold&nbsp;
claim so that you will purchase their product,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.720
watch their video. And, frankly, it's quite&nbsp;
dishonest. In English, we have a phrase,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.560
maybe this exists in your native language too, "If&nbsp;
something is too good to be true, it probably is."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.200
That means if something seems perfect, there's&nbsp;
probably a problem with it. It's probably lying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.440
to you. Sometimes this can be really frustrating,&nbsp;
especially if you spend a lot of time and money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.680
hoping that that bold claim will be true.
But hold on, I'm not here to figuratively rain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.720
on your English learning parade. It may be true&nbsp;
that perfect fluency is not achievable in 30 days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.160
but that doesn't mean that you can't become&nbsp;
fluent. It just means that your English journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.600
is going to take a little longer or look a little&nbsp;
different than you expect. And that's great.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.920
There's no perfect way, no set time frame, or&nbsp;
exact learning style that's going to work for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.080
everyone. I'm here today to help you break&nbsp;
out of that mindset and also to help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.680
along on your English journey to fluency.
But do you know what? Let's use a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.040
word than fluency. Fluency feels&nbsp;
like there is a definite end point.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.720
Like when you take an exam, the exam is finished,&nbsp;
and you receive a grade, and that's it. You're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.280
finished. But learning a language isn't&nbsp;
like that. Instead of achieving fluency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.040
I want to use the word confidence. To achieve&nbsp;
confidence speaking in English, because this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.720
is something real, something that you can feel.&nbsp;
You can feel your confidence growing the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.360
that you learn and the more that you practice.&nbsp;
So, you'll know that you're actually improving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.240
when you feel your confidence improving too.
Do you remember when you were a kid and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.600
tried to ride a bike for the first time? Or&nbsp;
roller blade or roller skate for the first time?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.680
You were probably a little bit wobbly and&nbsp;
uncertain. You probably fell a lot. Probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.000
got hurt. Hopefully, not too badly. Well, this&nbsp;
takes time, and a lot of practice and effort,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.360
also making a lot of mistakes. Falling&nbsp;
down and learning how to balance yourself.&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.200
Well, learning English is quite similar to&nbsp;
that, except you don't need to wear a helmet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.280
I don't think so. If you are a beginner,&nbsp;
now, it will take you longer to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.480
speak English confidently. If you are an&nbsp;
intermediate or advanced English learner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.720
well, with daily practice speaking weekly with a&nbsp;
teacher, or some other English learners it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.880
take less time for you to be able to feel like you&nbsp;
can speak English confidently. A big determining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.000
factor is how much time and effort you put in&nbsp;
to exercising those English speaking muscles.&nbsp;

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.280
Do you know this fable or tale of The Hare and The&nbsp;
Tortoise? Or sometimes we say The Tortoise and The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.040
Hare. The tortoise is a turtle. A hare is a wild&nbsp;
rabbit. In this story, they're going on a race,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.080
and the rabbit or the hare is so certain&nbsp;
that he's going to win. Rabbits are fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.600
turtles are slow, it's just a fact. So, the hare&nbsp;
starts running and running, and then he thinks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.680
"I can take a nap. It's fine. I'll stop. Maybe&nbsp;
I'll go eat some lunch. I'll take another nap,"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.080
and he gets distracted. But what does that&nbsp;
tortoise do? The tortoise just goes slow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.240
and steady, never stopping, but is determined&nbsp;
to make it to the end, slow and steady.&nbsp;

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.120
Can you guess who wins the race? Well, of course,&nbsp;
the tortoise wins the race. And I think that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.400
is a wonderful example of what it means to learn&nbsp;
English. If you are steady, you are consistent and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.160
dedicated. "Every day, I'm going to do something&nbsp;
with English. Maybe it's just listen to a song in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.600
English because I don't have much time today.&nbsp;
Or maybe it's watch one of Vanessa's lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.320
Or maybe it's watch a full movie in English."&nbsp;
Doing something dedicated consistently in English&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.920
will help you achieve confidence much quicker.
The problem with the promise fluency in 30 days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.920
is that you feel so much pressure. All right,&nbsp;
I need to achieve fluency in 30 days or else I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.920
lose. And it kind of feels like after 30 days,&nbsp;
you won't need to do anything else ever again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.160
Well, this can feel like a lot of pressure because&nbsp;
first of all, like we talked about, it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:40.080
possible to become fluent or speak confidently&nbsp;
in 30 days. But also, that feeling of, "I lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.560
I failed at learning English because&nbsp;
I couldn't learn it in 30 days,"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.880
that is a terrible feeling and will absolutely&nbsp;
not help you to achieve your goals in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.360
This is your journey. I want to help you&nbsp;
to continue to slow and steady feel and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.640
more confident in English without feeling&nbsp;
like mistakes are a problem. Mistakes are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.880
important. They are inevitable. You cannot avoid&nbsp;
mistakes. That is an essential part of learning.&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.200
So, while 30 days may be too short of a&nbsp;
time for you to become a confident speaker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.000
30 days is a great amount of time for building&nbsp;
daily habits. If you do something for 30 days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.040
great, it will become a normal part of your life.&nbsp;
So, I would love to give you some suggestions.&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.400
Suggestion number one, schedule a certain time&nbsp;
each day for English. Make sure that this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.680
realistic. You cannot say, "I will study for four&nbsp;
hours after I come home from work every day." Do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.560
you know what's going to happen after one week,&nbsp;
maybe less? We call this burnout. You will burn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.640
out. That means you will become so exhausted, and&nbsp;
you will be annoyed at learning English. You won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.680
want to do it anymore. So, make sure that you set&nbsp;
a realistic time, 15 minutes, 30 minutes. Set this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.840
time aside and make it the most important&nbsp;
thing that you want to accomplish that day.&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.840
For that 15 or 30 minutes, you can play a podcast&nbsp;
in English while you are commuting to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.160
If you don't commute, you could listen to&nbsp;
a podcast while you're cooking breakfast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.440
while you're folding the laundry, while you're&nbsp;
taking a walk around your neighborhood. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.520
just spend that time doing something with English.&nbsp;
Or you could subscribe to my YouTube channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.760
I have over 300 English lessons. Maybe&nbsp;
you have not seen all of them. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.800
you could watch one lesson per day, that's&nbsp;
about 30 minutes each day, immerse yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.040
in English and learn something new. Great.&nbsp;
And I hope you will enjoy it at the same time.&nbsp;

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:50.320
My first tip was to set aside a specific amount&nbsp;
of time every day. My second tip is to surround&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.080
yourself with English. Even if you're not in an&nbsp;
English speaking country, you can still do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:02.240
You can find fun and creative ways to immerse&nbsp;
yourself. Here are some of my suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.320
You can change the language settings on your&nbsp;
phone, or on your browser on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.440
That means that just as you are looking at&nbsp;
news articles, or as you are reading a recipe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.720
whatever you're doing on your phone, all of&nbsp;
the text is going to be in English. Simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.000
effective, and doesn't take any extra time.
You could also take some sticky notes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.200
or little pieces of paper with tape and put&nbsp;
them around your house to label different items.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.920
Write a full sentence, and this will help you&nbsp;
to be able to see English and have your brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.600
switch over to English for that moment. You could&nbsp;
read your favorite books in English. If you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.280
any recommendations for good books in English,&nbsp;
I love reading, so I have made, I think, four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.760
videos about book recommendations. You can check&nbsp;
out this one up here, which is beginner books.&nbsp;

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.400
Or if you have never read a book in English before&nbsp;
I recommend starting with those books. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.600
check out that link up here to get some ideas.&nbsp;
Or you can check out the link in the description,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.560
which is my Amazon storefront. I have listed on&nbsp;
there, all of the books that I recommend, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:18.400
can just click on them and purchase them. I think&nbsp;
I get like 10 cents from each purchase. So, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.440
not really that much for me, but it's just a way&nbsp;
to show you the books that you can read and give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.240
some recommendations and where you can get them.
And finally, of course, you can watch some TV&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.120
shows or cartoons in English. Sometimes children's&nbsp;
cartoons are a great way to get started. They use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.920
simple language for kids and they speak slowly,&nbsp;
you can see the action developing. It's a good way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.560
to start to immerse yourself more in English. For&nbsp;
some other ways that you can speak English just by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.680
being at home you can check out this video I made&nbsp;
up here, which goes into that topic more in depth.&nbsp;

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.200
My first tip was to schedule a certain amount&nbsp;
of time every day. Second tip was to surround&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:07.920
yourself with English. And the third tip is, can&nbsp;
you guess? Do you got it? It is to speak. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.680
think that you could improve your speaking without&nbsp;
really speaking, right? If you spend all your time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.720
listening to podcasts, watching TV shows, watching&nbsp;
my videos, but never actually speaking in English,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.680
well, you're going to have a lot of head&nbsp;
knowledge, but you won't be able to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.880
So, I want to empower you to be&nbsp;
able to use what you're learning.&nbsp;

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.720
If you are like most people, the thought of&nbsp;
speaking in English gives you some stage fright.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.760
Stage fright means anxiety, you are nervous about&nbsp;
speaking in English. Well, you're not alone. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:47.680
me give you some tips to help you get started.&nbsp;
If you have a pet speak in English to them. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.680
can narrate your day. "This is what I did today. I&nbsp;
went to work and when I was talking with my boss,"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.840
blah, blah, blah, blah. Or as you're cooking, you&nbsp;
can narrate what you're doing. "I need to crack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.440
the eggs. And I need to mix them together. And&nbsp;
chop up some cheese." You are like the star of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.880
a cooking show and no one else is listening.&nbsp;
Or if your family's listening, tell them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.280
"Don't judge me. I'm doing my own thing." And you&nbsp;
can speak out loud about these daily activities.&nbsp;

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.640
I know it's really important to have vocabulary,&nbsp;
to be able to do that, so you can check out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.320
this video that I made up here about specific&nbsp;
words that you can use for daily conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.800
for daily life. It's really great to be able&nbsp;
to look around the room and name everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.200
and talk about everything that you see. These&nbsp;
are real things that are in our daily lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.600
So, you need to be able to talk about it.&nbsp;
Well, that's one way, to speak in your home.&nbsp;

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.280
The next thing you can do to help yourself feel&nbsp;
more comfortable speaking is to record your voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.600
The most important thing to know here is that&nbsp;
you don't need to share this with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.080
You can record your voice, listen to it and&nbsp;
delete it immediately. You don't need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.840
share this with the internet. You don't need&nbsp;
to share this with a teacher. If you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.000
this can be just for you. And that might help you&nbsp;
to relieve a little anxiety, but it's good to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.240
able to listen to your voice, listen to how&nbsp;
it sounds, be kind to yourself. And also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.240
hear if there are specific sounds that don't sound&nbsp;
like my voice, well, if you're trying to imitate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.760
the way that I speak, it's a good thing to be&nbsp;
able to improve your pronunciation based on that.&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.560
I have a couple videos about shadowing&nbsp;
pronunciation, that's what this is called.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.920
Listening to a native speaker, repeating it and&nbsp;
recording yourself so that you can hear it. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.040
can check out that lesson up here. I'm mentioning&nbsp;
a lot of previous lessons today. You can check out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:49.200
this lesson up here about repeating, and saying&nbsp;
some of the most important phrases, or most common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.400
phrases in English. This will help you to be&nbsp;
able to speak out loud and build that confidence.&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.560
My final tip for speaking is to just do it. The&nbsp;
first two are a little easy. You talk with your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:08.800
pet, talk while you're cooking, record yourself,&nbsp;
that's a little isolated. But you can find someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.640
to speak on Zoom with, to speak on WhatsApp&nbsp;
with, to speak on Facebook Messenger with,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.320
to speak on Skype with, to be able to contact&nbsp;
someone. It could be another English learner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.080
it could be an English teacher, but just being&nbsp;
able to speak with someone else, even 10 minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.640
simple, straightforward, have a very clear&nbsp;
conversation just a couple minutes can help to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.800
let go of that stress, and to realize guys, "Oh,&nbsp;
I can do this. I have a lot I need to improve,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.040
but I can do this. Okay, just do it."
If you don't know who to speak with a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:53.600
of students in my course, The Fearless Fluency&nbsp;
Club, speak together each week, sometimes three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.680
or four times per week. They can learn the&nbsp;
same lesson material that I send to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.000
But they can also connect on Zoom, Skype,&nbsp;
WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.760
together. They can ask questions about the course&nbsp;
together, practicing that vocabulary, and grammar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.640
and pronunciation. Or they can just get to know&nbsp;
each other and really deepen those friendships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.720
with people around the world in English.
So, if you would like a good place to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.840
start for meeting other people, this is&nbsp;
a great place. Everyone is so kind and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.040
understanding about what it's like to learn&nbsp;
English and feel nervous. So, I hope that you&nbsp;&nbsp;
