00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.980
Dan: Hello.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.510
Vanessa: Hello, hello.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.380
Welcome to today's live English lesson here
on the wonderful Speak English with Vanessa

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.150
YouTube channel page.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.150
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.260
I'm Vanessa and this is my husband, Dan.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.410
Dan: I'm Dan.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.480
You might know me well.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.480
Vanessa: Yes.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.269
Dan is going to help today to explain three
valuable English expressions.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.749
One of them is a phrasal verb.

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.029
One of them is an idiom and what's the last
one?

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.839
Dan: We got slang as well.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.169
We like slang around here.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.030
Vanessa: Yes, so we're hopefully help you
to expand your vocabulary and also just see

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.559
some specific examples when you can use this
in your daily conversations or in your writing

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.610
or in your job or in your travels, anytime
that you use English.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.510
If you're joining us live, thanks so much.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
Let us know where you're from and let us know
in the chat box.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.359
We're going to be asking a lot of questions
today so make sure that you interact and participate.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.280
You can write out the questions.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.059
You can write out your answers even if you're
not watching live, if you're watching the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.059
replay, you can do the same thing.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.120
Write out the questions.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.580
Write out your own answers.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.579
Try to use these because that's the best way
to remember what you're learning.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.450
Dan: Yes, and a happy, early, Merry Christmas,
if anybody has noticed our Christmas tree

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.450
back here.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.450
Vanessa: Yes.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.450
Dan: I love Christmas.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.450
It's my favorite time of year.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.030
Vanessa: Yeah so we decided to open the door
so that you could get a little sneak preview

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.110
of our Christmas tree.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.330
That was Dan's idea.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Thanks.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.330
Dan: Yes.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.330
You need the sneak preview.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Vanessa: Yes.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Yes.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.150
Thank you, everyone who's joining us from
Mexico, India, Brazil.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.229
Dan: Japan.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.840
Vanessa: Yemen, Columbia.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.920
Dan: Egypt.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.000
Vanessa: Hungary.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.539
Peru, Turkey, Morocco.

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:40.539
Wow.

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:41.630
Dan: Kurdistan, never been there.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.390
Vanessa: From everywhere.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.690
Everywhere around the world.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.690
Thanks so much.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.140
I'd like to start by asking you the first
question.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.140
Dan: Okay.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.609
Vanessa: My first question is, what has to
do with something that happened this week.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:01.220
We had a friend who invited us to an escape
room for her birthday but I had never heard

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.070
of that so could you explain it to me?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.400
What's in an escape room, because if my friend's
inviting me there for her birthday, I want

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.660
to know what I'm going to do.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.660
Dan: Yeah.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.380
An escape room, I don't know if they do this
in other countries yet, but it's started to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.630
get kind of popular in America so you actually
pay to get locked up in a room.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.630
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.630
Dan: It's filled with puzzles so you have
to, one might say figure out some puzzles.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.380
I've done one before and I remember they started
me off in the room in handcuffs with all the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.480
lights off.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.450
Vanessa: You were with other people or were
you alone?

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.450
Dan: I was with other people.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.450
Vanessa: Okay.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.520
Dan: It'd be a little scary alone I think.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.760
Vanessa: Yeah, I guess you could do it alone
but it's fun as maybe a group activity.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.940
That's why we got invited to a friend's house.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.420
Dan: Right, and they call it an escape room
because you're supposed to escape the room,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.300
that's the point of the game so I don't know.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.650
Do they have that in your countries?

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.450
Vanessa: Yeah, are escape rooms becoming popular
in your country?

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.090
The kind of principle of this type of activity
is that you have to figure out how to get

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.370
out of the room.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.030
What is this lovely phrasal verb here?

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.030
Figure out.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.920
Dan: Figure out, that means to learn how to
do something.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
Vanessa: Yes.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.630
Dan: It usually means it's a little difficult.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.250
You're working on something.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.530
Maybe you have a really hard math problem.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.180
This happened to me all the time when I was
in school.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.470
Math was not my strong suit so I had to figure
out how to solve the problem.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.020
Vanessa: Yes, you had to figure out so this
kind of implies a process.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.070
It's difficult, maybe you have to look from
one resource to the next resource and ask

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.070
someone.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.600
You have to do some problem solving, kind
of like you can imagine if Dan's in a dark

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.340
room with his friends, handcuffed, and they
have to figure out how to get out of the room,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.930
that involves a process.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.590
You have to problem solve and figure out other
things so I want to know for you, my question

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.570
for you is when was a time you had to figure
out how to solve a problem.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.180
Dan: You can also say, figure it out.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.500
Vanessa: Figure it out, so when would we use
figure it out?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500
Dan: Yeah.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.280
If you're already in the process of working
on something, you might just say to yourself,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.220
oh, man, I really need to figure it out.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.340
Vanessa: Yeah, so the other day.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.430
Dan: I need to figure this out.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.419
Vanessa: I was in the office, in this room
and I think I made some kind of sound like,

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.759
some kind of frustrated sound and you said
from the other room.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.210
Hey, Vanessa, are you okay?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.830
I said, I was fine.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.510
I'll figure it out.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.430
I didn't tell him any specifics.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.870
I didn't say I'm working on this problem on
the website and technical things are sometimes

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.870
frustrating to me.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.159
I didn't give him any details.

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.740
I just said, oh, I'll figure it out.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.140
Dan: She knew I wouldn't be able to figure
it out so.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.950
Vanessa: I didn't want to explain those details.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.270
Dan: She figured it out on her own.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.830
Vanessa: Yes, so do you think that this is
an expression and a phrasal verb that you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.330
could use in a workplace situation?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.330
Dan: Yeah.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.530
Vanessa: If you have some kind of problem?

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.530
Dan: Absolutely.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.530
Yeah.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.310
Vanessa: It's useful for those kind of professional
situations, certainly so maybe if you have

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.650
a problem on some kind of report that you're
working on and you want to ask a coworker

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.650
about it.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.919
Dan: Can you help me figure this out?

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.789
Vanessa: Figure this out.

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.820
Dan: That would be polite and it's acceptable.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.069
It's not slang.

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:24.820
Vanessa: Yeah, it's not slang.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:32.129
It can be polite and you can split this phrasal
verb like Dan just did, figure it out or figure

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:39.550
this out or figure this problem out, figure
this thing out so you can split it or you

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.979
can keep it together, no problem.

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.810
We've got two different choices.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.969
A lot of you are writing wonderful expressions
here.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.569
I see, Zahira says, I will figure out how
to get confident in English.

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:51.569
Dan: That's a good one.

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:52.569
Vanessa: That is a great one.

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:53.569
Dan: Yeah.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.250
Vanessa: Here, we can kind of imagine that
you're solving the problem.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.789
You're working through this issue and you're
going to figure it out.

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.039
I will figure it out.

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.039
I know I'll do it.

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:08.010
Dan: I couldn't figure out what my boss was
talking about as I don't speak Mongolian.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.010
That's a good one too.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.009
I couldn't figure it out, in the negative.

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.050
Vanessa: Yes, so when you're using this in
the negative version, just like we saw here

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.169
in the sample sentence from those of you who
are here live with us, saying I couldn't figure

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.440
out what my boss was saying or maybe if you
had an English teacher who just talked way

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.569
too fast and talked about too many complex
things, then maybe you would say, oh, I can't

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.199
figure out what Vanessa is saying.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.650
She's just talking too fast.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.129
Dan: We have a question.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.599
Is find out, similar?

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.699
Vanessa: Oh, this is a great question.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:39.699
Dan: Find out.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.919
Vanessa: I want to give you a little tip,
maybe a year ago, over a year ago or maybe

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.171
less than a year ago, I'm not sure.

00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:50.629
I made a video comparing figure out and find
out.

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:55.479
After this has finished, I'll link this video
up here and then also in the description but

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.330
I want you to get some more details about
that.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:04.090
If I said, I'm going to find out who is at
the door.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.550
Dan: That means you're going to discover,
you're going to see, find out.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.300
You don't know right now and then you're going
to find out, you're going to discover.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.680
Vanessa: It kind of doesn't imply that process.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.139
You're searching a difficult thing.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.069
Instead, it's an instant thing like, a-ha.

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:23.059
I opened the door, and I can see who's there.

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.099
I'm going to find out who's there.

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:29.409
Dan: Yeah, maybe if you said, I'm going to
figure out who's at the door, maybe you hear

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.990
a knock on the door and you look through the
hole and you don't see anybody or maybe somebody

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.710
is wearing a mask and then they give you a
puzzle.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.620
Vanessa: Yes, so it is kind of implies a process.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.620
Dan: It needs to be more involved.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.789
Vanessa: Yes, so if you would like some more
details about figure out versus find out,

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:49.581
feel free to check out that video but in general,
figure out means there's some process, you're

00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.879
searching, you're figuring out how to do something.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:58.819
We often add how at the end, figure out how
to escape from the room, figure out how to

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:03.180
become a confident English speaker and find
out is just the solution.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.639
Find out what is happening.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.729
Find out who is at the door.

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:09.720
Dan: I want to find out what presents are
under my Christmas tree.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.830
Vanessa: Are there any presents under our
Christmas tree?

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.319
Dan: There are no presents.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:16.089
Vanessa: maybe someday there will be presents
under the Christmas tree.

00:08:16.089 --> 00:08:17.089
Dan: Christmas is ruined.

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:18.889
Vanessa: Oh, well when you have a toddler.

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:19.930
Dan: It's still early.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.539
Vanessa: You can't put Christmas presents
under the tree early.

00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:25.919
It's a recipe for getting them opened.

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:26.919
Dan: Yes.

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:27.919
Vanessa: All right.

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:32.800
I'd like to go to the second expression, which
is an idiom.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.229
This past week, our car was doing some kind
of funny things, making some funny sounds

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:41.669
and I noticed that you didn't fix the car
yourself.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.669
Dan: No.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:43.669
Vanessa: You took it to the mechanic.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.190
Why did you take the car to the mechanic?

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.070
Dan: Well, I'm not a mechanic.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.030
I'm not very handy.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.100
Handy means you can fix a lot of things.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:09:00.290
I'm kind of handy but not with cars so I am
in over my head when it comes to fixing cars.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:05.000
I would be in over my head if I tried to fix
my car.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
In over my head.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.500
Vanessa: A lovely idiom.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.870
In over my head.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.070
We need four words here.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.070
Dan: In what?

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:18.390
Vanessa: Well, we can kind of imagine the
feeling of being overwhelmed.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:24.110
You're completely surrounded or covered in
the problem so here we can imagine Dan opening

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.280
the car, trying to fix the problem.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.990
He's trying to figure out what's making that
strange sound.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.000
He's trying to look around.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.560
Dan: I'm ripping pieces out of the car.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.590
Vanessa: Oh, and he thinks, oh, it's going
to be a disaster.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:40.710
I should just go to the mechanic because I
am in over my head.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.360
It's a problem that's too big.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.990
Dan: You can think of swimming in the ocean.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.750
If you're drowning, the waters over your head.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.750
You're in trouble.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.750
Vanessa: Yes.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.750
Dan: You're you're struggling.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.050
Vanessa: I think that's a great image.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.120
Dan: I think this is where this comes from.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.270
Vanessa: Yeah, when I think of this expression,
I do think of water that you're in the swimming

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:06.600
pool or in the ocean and the water's getting
higher and higher and when the water is over

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.030
your head, bad news.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.310
Dan: Yeah, I mean really, that probably means
you're going to die.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.310
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.450
Dan: This is a little bit of an expression
that's not literal, obvious.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.910
That's why it's idiom right?

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.290
You're just in trouble.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.290
You're in big trouble.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.290
Vanessa: Yes.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.290
In over your head.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.710
I want to know for you, when was a situation
that was just too much for you and you felt

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.830
like you were in over your head.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.220
What was a time?

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:39.290
Maybe you decided to volunteer at your job
to be the person who helps the American director

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.350
who's coming to your office and you said,
sure, I'll talk to the American director.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.500
I'll take him out to dinner, I'll guide him
around the office.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.500
I can speak English.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:53.610
This is fine, and then you meet him and you
realize he has a strong Southern accent.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.470
Dan: Howdy, folks.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:02.470
Vanessa: Maybe at the end of that day, you
feel like I was in over my head.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.580
This situation was too much for me.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.080
I can understand English, but I didn't realize
that his accent would be so strong.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.100
I was in over my head.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.310
Dan: Yeah, I have a personal example.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.310
Vanessa: Yes.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.310
What was your personal example?

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.270
Dan: We used to teach English in South Korea,
you probably know this.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:28.610
I had never taught children before so the
first time I had to teach a class of children,

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.710
I was in over my head.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:36.030
In over my head because the children, they
didn't necessarily respect me yet.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.860
I'm different looking in South Korea, my red
hair and my freckles.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.450
They thought it was weird.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.700
They didn't take me seriously, they started
yelling and screaming.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.820
I was in over my head because I didn't know
what to do about it so.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.740
Vanessa: Yes, and over time, you learned more
and more what to do but that's a perfect situation

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.510
and perfect expression to use especially for
your first day at school, your first day as

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.970
a teacher, your first day at your job, maybe
your first day living in the U.S. or if you

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:05.970
move to Australia.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.970
Dan: This happens a lot.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.970
Vanessa: I was in over my head that first
day, but eventually it got better so I want

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.400
to know for you, when was a situation when
you were in over your head?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.090
Dan: Tell us about it.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.110
Vanessa: Yes, yes.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.510
Let us know in the comments.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.990
Make sure that you use this expression as
much as you can.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.240
I'd like to read a sentence that one of you
wrote, I was in over my head.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.900
I was stressed.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.940
I couldn't do it.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.150
Oh, stress is usually associated with being
in over your head.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.150
You're stressed.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.150
You're overwhelmed.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.330
Yes, it's just too much.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.760
I'm in over my head.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.990
Khaled says, I'm in over my head.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.920
The American director speaks too fast.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.430
Dan: That's a good example.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.210
Vanessa: I hope that that didn't happen to
you but if this happened, you're going to

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.220
use a beautiful idiom to describe it, oh,
I'm in over my head.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.270
Dan: Are you in over your head when you watch
Vanessa's videos?

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.270
I hope not.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.270
Vanessa: Oh, yes.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.400
I hope that you can easily understand and
you're not too cool for my videos.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.090
Dan: She's a little advanced.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.870
Vanessa: Sure, if you're here.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.460
That means you can already understand two
native English speakers.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.670
Congratulations, but hopefully it means that
you're learning something new while also understanding

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.660
most of our explanations.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.280
I just used our third expression.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280
Dan: You did?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.320
Vanessa: The slang expression.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.700
I hope you're not too cool for these videos.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.360
Dan: Too cool for.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360
Vanessa: Yes.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.020
I want to know when you were a teenager, what
was something that you decided that you didn't

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.020
want to do anymore?

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.870
Dan: Yeah, I can actually go back to when
I was younger.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.870
Vanessa: Okay.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:40.180
Dan: Even when I was a kid, when I was eight
years old, I was too cool for Barney.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.200
You know Barney is?

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.820
Vanessa: Barney is a kids TV show.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.450
It's probably popular around the world.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:47.530
It's a big purple dinosaur.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:54.220
Dan: He's a big purple dinosaur in a big costume
and he's, I'm happy, you know and I remember

00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.160
being as a kid, I was too cool for Barney
and this means that I thought it was dumb.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.200
I wouldn't watch it myself.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.940
If somebody was watching this show, I would
maybe look down on them.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.780
Vanessa: They're too like, they're children.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.780
Children, watch this.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.670
I'm too old and too cool for this.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.470
Dan: I don't watch Barney.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.090
I'm too cool for Barney.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.090
Vanessa: Yes.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.460
I feel like this slang expression, too cool.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.990
Dan: Barney, B-A-R-N-Y.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.000
Vanessa: N-E-Y?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.020
Dan: Y?

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.020
E-Y?

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.020
Vanessa: E-Y?

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.020
Something like that.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.550
I'm sure you'll find the big purple dinosaur
online.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.550
Dan: That's it.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.760
Vanessa: Well, when you say too cool for something,
it's pretty self explanatory.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.640
You feel like, this is for children.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.310
This is for someone who is less than me so
it's a slang expression where you feel like

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:46.530
you're above some kind of item or activity
or concept.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.620
Oftentimes, teenagers feel like this.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:56.590
Maybe when you were a teenager, you felt like
you were too cool to hold hands with your

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.620
mom when you cross to the street.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.270
You said, I'm a teenager.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.270
I can handle this.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.670
I'm too cool for that and you kind of feel
like that's for children.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.780
Dan: Yes, and this slang term definitely implies
attitude.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.320
You're not just saying, oh no, I don't like
that.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.000
You're saying, that's stupid.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.320
Vanessa: Yeah, I'm too cool for that.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.470
Dan: That's dumb.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.450
I wouldn't listen to that music anymore, loser.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.710
Vanessa: Yeah, so you might hear this often
used by kids, like in Dan's example about

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:33.160
the children's TV show or by teenagers but
we can use this as adults in a joking way

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.770
because we often take expressions that are
strong and then use them in lighter situations

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.210
where it's not as serious.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:49.190
For example, maybe if I want to watch, I don't
know if you've seen the, I think it's a Pixar

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.420
movie, Coco.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.550
It's really cute and I enjoyed it a lot.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:59.270
If I asked Dan, hey, do you want to watch
Coco tonight?

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.270
He might say.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.270
Dan: I would say.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.270
Vanessa: He would say yes.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.000
Let's imagine that he might say no and let's
say-

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Dan: Let's say I'm too cool.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.600
Vanessa: Yeah, I might say, what?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600
Dan: Coco.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.650
Vanessa: Are you too cool to watch Coco?

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.330
Dan: I don't watch cartoons.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.200
Vanessa: That's not true but in this situation.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.380
Dan: I actually love cartoons.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.540
Vanessa: We might say, I might say to Dan,
are you too cool for Coco?

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.010
Dan: Too cool for Coco.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.100
Vanessa: Are you too cool for Pixar movies?

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.980
Are you to cool for more animated movies?

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:35.790
Here, we're using this not in a, like a teenager
or childish way, but just in a joke kind of

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.790
way.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.790
Dan: It's kind of a joke.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.530
Vanessa: Yeah, to say oh, you think you're
better than this movie?

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.620
It's great for everybody.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.620
I enjoy it.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.030
I think a lot of people have enjoyed it so
you can use too cool for something in a lot

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.030
of situations.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:54.810
Dan: By the way, the original expression I
think from too cool is too cool for school.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.930
We actually say that still.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:02.970
Sometimes people even say that like as a good
thing, like, wow, that's too cool for school.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.310
Vanessa: When would you use that?

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.240
This is taking slang to the next level, extra
slang.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.270
Dan: If you saw maybe like an outfit that
was really cool.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:18.329
You'd say, that's too cool, or that's too
cool for school.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:23.309
I wouldn't say this is extremely common but
it's, people would understand you're not being

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:24.309
rude.

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:27.730
Vanessa: Yeah, so I imagine if you heard this
in a TV show or a movie, now you'll feel a

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:32.460
little more comfortable with too cool and
also too cool for school, which is just the

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.190
rhyming original expression.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:39.529
Dan: Yeah, the original expression was, you
would say somebody is too cool for school.

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:41.259
He's too cool for school.

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:43.190
He doesn't like to go to school.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.169
He is unhappy at school.

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:46.330
Vanessa: He has an attitude.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.429
Dan: He doesn't like reading, that kind of
thing.

00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:49.720
That's the original source.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.720
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.710
Well, we have a lot of great sentences here
from those of you who are joining us live,

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.320
talking about-
Dan: Your grandma's too cool to watch Coco.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.309
Vanessa: Oh, no.

00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:03.380
Well, Sylvester says I will never be too cool
to watch cartoons.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.380
Dan: I agree.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.960
Vanessa: I'll never be too cool for cartoons.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.139
Dan: Maybe it's because I was a child with
cartoons.

00:18:10.139 --> 00:18:13.740
I still like cartoons especially Miyazaki,
does anybody watching Miyazaki, Japanese animation.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.740
Vanessa: Very cool.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.740
Dan: I like that.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:21.350
Vanessa: Very cool or another great comment
we've got here is, I'm too cool for dancing.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:27.370
Oh, so maybe if your friend asked you to go
to a concert to dance or a club or somewhere

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.960
to dance on, I'm too cool for dancing.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.749
Dan: I'm not too cool for dancing but I'm
bad at dancing so.

00:18:32.749 --> 00:18:36.999
Vanessa: There are lots of excuses you can
give, various excuses.

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:38.799
Dan: Too cool for Brad Pitt?

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:43.580
Vanessa: Oh, maybe there's a lot of different
ways that you can use too cool for something.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:48.490
Well, I'd like to thank you so much for joining
us to learn about phrasal verbs, idioms and

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.840
the slang expression today.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.940
Figure out, in over my head and too cool for
something.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.950
If you enjoyed Dan and I's explanation and
our little stories about this, we do this

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.490
every month in The Fearless Fluency Club.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.399
We make a vocabulary lesson that's about,
how long would you say?

00:19:06.399 --> 00:19:08.350
Dan: That's like 30, 40 minutes.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.549
Vanessa: Oh, I'd say it's about an hour.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.409
Usually there's two parts.

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:16.159
There's two 30 minute parts that we have for
the vocabulary lessons.

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:17.159
Dan: Okay, that's true.

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:18.159
We cut it in half.

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:21.860
Vanessa: Yeah, we cut it in half and make
two different parts so you'll get an hour

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:27.470
of about 15 to 20 vocabulary expressions every
month.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:32.130
For the month of December, you got a sneak
preview about these expressions.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:40.659
In December, three of the 17 or 18 expressions
are figure out something, in over my head

00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:42.389
and too cool for something.

00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:43.389
Dan: Too cool.

00:19:43.389 --> 00:19:47.059
Vanessa: These are three expressions that
we talk about in the December lesson set for

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:51.559
The Fearless Fluency Club so I'd like to show
you really quick and give you a quick sneak

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.559
preview.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.570
Dan: Yes, so Let's take a look.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:59.929
Vanessa: Yes, of this wonderful monthly lesson
set so that you can see here.

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:07.100
We have the December 2018 lesson set that's
going to come out tomorrow.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:13.679
If you join in December, you'll get access
to the December lesson set and you can use

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:21.029
the coupon code NEW, N-E-W to get it for only
$5 and I'd like to show you here, we have

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:24.289
the vocabulary that we just mentioned.

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:27.981
The vocabulary part one, you can see, oh we're
going to put this on.

00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:28.981
Dan: I had a haircut.

00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:32.379
Vanessa: On mute, just so that you can see
it.

00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:38.690
We talk about a lot of different expressions
and then you can see the clips from the original

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:44.690
conversation when it was used so here, you're
getting great explanations from Dan and I.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.690
Two different parts and then we go on to the
grammar lesson and in December, you're going

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.860
to get one of the longest grammar lessons
that I've ever made.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:00.090
It's 34 minutes but you're going to get access
to this grammar lesson where we're going to

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:05.700
discuss some excellent expressions with would
have.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.019
Would have, oh, this is a complex verb.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:14.159
It seems simple but it's quite complex so
we break it down, go through it step by step

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:17.110
and I try to help you use it naturally.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.179
Then in the next section in December, we talk
about pronunciation.

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:28.190
This pronunciation lesson is extra special
because we're going to be focusing on a lot

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.190
of sentences.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.830
Oh, here we have a sentence with figure out,
they can figure things out.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:39.149
We go through this step by step and you can
figure out how to pronounce this sentence

00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:44.830
as accurately as possible and then you get
to watch the conversation with my friend,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.830
Faith.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:51.700
You get to hear her naturally say this originally
in the conversation because the last video

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:59.450
is the conversation where we have a 30 minute
chat together about her interesting job, working

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.450
for AmeriCorps, which is a nonprofit in the
U.S.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:09.960
She volunteers at different schools, at different
organizations and has interesting perspective

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.880
about education.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.539
We're going to talk about some wonderful ideas
there.

00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:21.899
We also focus on a story that includes all
of the vocabulary and grammar.

00:22:21.899 --> 00:22:24.919
All of the would have expressions.

00:22:24.919 --> 00:22:27.759
Some new expressions as well that are in the
story.

00:22:27.759 --> 00:22:32.600
This is a fun Christmas story because it's
the December lesson set and you can study

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.119
this all together.

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:42.249
I hope that this lesson set overall will help
you to feel comfortable using English and

00:22:42.249 --> 00:22:48.990
really trying to incorporate it into your
daily life so if you enjoyed today's lesson,

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.960
feel free to join us every month in The Fearless
Fluency Club.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.830
There is a link in the description.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:58.049
You can continue learning with Dan and I.
Dan: You can figure out English with us.

00:22:58.049 --> 00:22:59.882
Vanessa: Yes, you can figure out how to use
it.

00:22:59.882 --> 00:23:01.870
Dan: If you're not too cool for school.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.879
Vanessa: Yeah, don't be too cool for school.

00:23:03.879 --> 00:23:09.990
Before we go today, I'd like to practice pronouncing
a final sentence that uses two of the expressions

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.220
we talked about today.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.390
I wrote it down here so that we can practice
it together.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:19.460
It is, I would like to say it slowly, and
then we're going to speed it up and I want

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.369
you to say it out loud so that you can use
your speaking muscles.

00:23:22.369 --> 00:23:24.390
I'd like you to join me too, Dan.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.390
Dan: Okay.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.390
Vanessa: Okay.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.390
Dan: I'm nervous.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.390
Vanessa: All right, we got this.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.470
The sentence is, I was in over my head before.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.870
Dan: In over my head.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:40.409
Vanessa: Now I figured out how to learn English.

00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:46.450
I was in over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.480
What does the sentence mean?

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.770
I was in over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:58.309
Dan: Well, this means that before today maybe,
you didn't know how to speak English at all.

00:23:58.309 --> 00:23:59.950
You didn't understand me.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.669
You didn't understand Vanessa, but now you
have figured it out.

00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:09.290
Vanessa: Yes, you have figured out the best
path and the best method is with Vanessa and

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.290
Dan.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.290
Dan: This is true.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.100
Vanessa: Let's speed this sentence up and
I want you to pronounce it clearly and then

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.100
use it yourself.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.100
Are you ready?

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:23.659
I was in over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:24.919
Let's say it faster.

00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:30.279
I was in over my head before, but now I've
figured out how to learn English.

00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:31.279
I wasn't over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:32.279
Can you say it?

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:34.230
Dan: I was in over my head before, but now
I have figured out how to learn English.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:40.309
Vanessa: I was in over my head before, but
now I have figured out how to learn English,

00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:43.070
with Vanessa and Dan.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.980
