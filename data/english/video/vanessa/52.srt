00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.250
Hi.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.180
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.510
Are you ready for a dictation?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.900
Let's get started.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.859
Today, I'd like to practice something new
on this channel that we've never done before.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.590
It's called dictation practice.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.380
I know some people might have tried this in
school before, maybe you had positive experiences

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.130
maybe negative experiences, but first of all
let's explain what it is and then lets do

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.629
it together, so that you can decide if it's
helpful for you, because I want to introduce

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.190
you to new ideas, new techniques and if it
works for you great.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.829
If you're not a big fan, no problem you tried
it.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.120
Let's talk about what is dictation.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.510
A dictation means that one person is speaking,
while someone else is writing exactly what

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.039
that person is saying.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:10.610
So, this type of practice, is useful for listening
skills and also listening for accuracy.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.040
Some people use this to improve their writing
skills, but personally I found that it really

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.729
has helped my listening skills, so that I
know each detail of what the person is saying.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.630
In general, with this idea you need to have
a piece of paper, a pencil and your ears ready,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.610
because someone today that's me, is gonna
read a couple of sentences and you need to

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.470
write exactly what those sentences are.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.600
Make sure that you use capital letters in
the correct places, make sure you use punctuation

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.130
in the correct places and most importantly,
make sure that the words are accurate.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.869
That's the whole goal.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.549
You wanna accurately hear what other people
are saying.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.119
To help with today's dictation, I brought
a really popular kids book.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.750
Maybe you read this in your own language when
you were a kid.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.080
This book is called Oh, the Places You'll
Go!!

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.450
And it's by a famous author, Dr. Seuss.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.740
Typically, Dr. Seuss likes to create fine
imaginative words for kids and usually his

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.230
language is a little bit different.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.950
He tries to make some fun words that create
different sounds with words.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.060
What I'm going to do is, I'm gonna choose
some normal sentences.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.480
Something that's close to daily conversation,
so that you can really practice listening

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.650
and writing.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.170
Before we go any further, I recommend getting
a piece of paper and getting something to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.590
write with.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.190
Pause this video, don't go any further until
you can write and participate.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.989
Because, I want you to try dictation and see
if it works for you.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.330
Don't just watch me read it, but also participate.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.340
Go right now get a piece of paper get something
to write with and participate.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.379
Are you ready?

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.629
I'm gonna show you first the picture for this
page.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.330
I'm gonna cover the words because I don't
want you to see them, but we gonna take a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.019
look here at this lovely picture.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:36.170
You can see a little guy over there he's walking,
he looks pretty confident, he's walking around

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.260
a crazy looking place, this is typical Dr.
Seuss illustrations and writing.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.780
I'm gonna read to you a couple of sentences,
one sentence slowly.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.961
Then I'll pause so that you have a chance
to write it, the next sentence slowly, then

00:03:55.961 --> 00:04:00.720
I'll pause and you can write it, and I'll
continue until we finish.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.939
Only one time.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.640
Then I'll go back and read it a second time,
so you can check your writing check your listening

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.360
skills maybe some of these words you never
heard before.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360
Great.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.139
It's a good listening practice to see if you
can guess how are they spelt?

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.799
How can you use this?

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.610
I'm gonna start with the first sentence, I'll
pause you can write and then at the very end,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.050
we'll go back and do it one more time so that
you can fix any thing that you dint hear correctly.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.690
Are you ready?

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.389
Let's start with the first sentence.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.930
You have brains in your head.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.740
Now is your turn to write.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.300
You have feet in your shoes.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:13.830
You 
can steer your self any direction you choose,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.490
So far we've had three sentences.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.150
Let's read the final part, and then we'll
go back.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:32.660
You're on your own.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:42.360
And you know what you know.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:57.330
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to
go.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.710
If you need dome more time to write before
we go back, it's okay, pause the video.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.430
We're gonna go back to the very beginning.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.669
I'm gonna read them with a little pause, not
too long, a little pause between sentences

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:16.620
so that you can hear the sentence again, check
your listening, check your writing.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.350
And then at the very end, of course, I'll
show you the correct answers so that you can

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.150
see how you did and if you'd like to continue
this style.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.110
Let's go back to the very beginning with a
little pause.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:37.280
You have brains in your head.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.120
You have feet in your shoes.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:54.580
You can steer yourself any direction you choose.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.810
You're on your own.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:07.200
And you know what you know.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.060
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to
go.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.580
All right?

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.120
We listened to all of these sentences two
times, slowly.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.880
If you need to pause the video, no problem.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.080
It's here forever.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.919
You can take a look at it whenever you want.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:29.870
Now, let's see the final answer.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:36.930
I'm going to show you the page and you can
see and compare to your writing to see how

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.930
it looks.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.120
Is it accurate?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.949
How is your spelling?

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.900
How is your listening?

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.620
Did you correctly hear each word, and maybe
the words that you don't know yet that you've

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.590
never heard before?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.910
How was your guess?

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.380
How did you guess that it was spelled?

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.500
Let's take a look at the correct answer.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.310
Okay, here you can see the correct answer.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.509
You have brains in your head.

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:04.700
You have feet in your shoes.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.789
You can steer yourself any direction you choose.

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:10.139
You're on your own.

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:12.160
And you know what you know.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.170
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to
go.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.160
How did you do?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.569
Maybe each sentence didn't stop at exactly
the same place his sentence stopped.

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:27.950
Maybe your punctuation wasn't exactly correct.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.950
That's all right.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:35.260
The most important thing is, that you understood
each word.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.440
Because if you're gonna understand the whole
meaning, you need to understand each word

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.840
first.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.940
And in total, we can see this guy, our friend
here, he is deciding where to go.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.630
And that is exactly what you're doing with
English.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.700
You are in control, you can decide where you
go.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:04.060
You can decide if you improve your English,
if you continue to study, if you spend valuable

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.010
time learning and enjoying it.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.660
It's your choice.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.360
Enjoy English and decide for yourself.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:18.470
Thanks so much for trying this dictation practice
with me, and let me know in the comments below

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.170
this video.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:25.240
What do you think about this extra listening
practice style?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.290
It's good to understand general ideas, but
this will help you with details.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.420
Understanding each word.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:40.620
I read this pretty slowly, but I recommend
the next step is to listen to your favorite

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.529
TV show, or someone who's speaking a little
bit faster.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:51.160
And we'll see if you're listening can keep
up with that style.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.440
Start slowly like we did today, and start
to go faster and faster.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.660
It will test your ears and help you to listen
for details.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.940
So, let me know in the comments below.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.950
What do you think?

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.220
Is this useful to you?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.800
Would you like me to make more dictation videos
in the future?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.110
Something slow like today maybe faster.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.360
Thanks so much for trying it with me and trying
something new.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.360
I'll see you the next time bye.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.050
