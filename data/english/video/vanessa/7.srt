Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.279
Can you have natural small talk?

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.980
Yes, you can.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.960
Let's talk about it.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.949
Even native English speakers feel uncomfortable
or awkward sometimes having small talk.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.971
Small talk means that you're not just saying,
"Hi, see you later, bye," instead, you're

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:36.440
having a short, light conversation, usually
with someone in passing or before you're going

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.410
to have a more in-depth discussion.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.930
When you see someone you know at the grocery
store, when you have a quick conversation

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.249
with a coworker as you're eating lunch, or
maybe when you're just wanting to make a new

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.280
friend, you need to have good small talk skills.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.179
Today, we're going to cover some of the most
common small talk questions and answers so

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.720
that you can be a professional small talk
expert.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
Let's go.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.600
The first topic is weather.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.460
Weather is a very simple, noncontroversial
neutral topic, unless you're talking about

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.380
climate change, in that case it's a little
more serious to talk about, but we often use

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.149
this as an ice breaker.

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.259
And ice breaker is a common expression we
use when talking about introducing a conversation,

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.299
you're helping it to become less awkward.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.869
You're having some icebreaker or small talk
discussion, and then you can relax and have

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.570
a normal discussion.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.560
Some common weather questions you might ask
are, "Isn't it a gorgeous day?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.219
Can you believe how rainy it's been?

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.219
Is it hot enough for you?"

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.250
This last one might seem a little strange,
but it is a silly or humorous way to address

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.390
how extremely hot the weather is, or maybe
extremely cold if you say, "Is it cold enough

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.080
for you?"

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.330
You're joking about the extreme temperature
that you're experiencing and it's a light

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.370
way to introduce a conversation.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.090
Notice that all three of these questions are
not open-ended questions.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.150
They are only yes or no questions, and this
makes it a very simple way to introduce the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.220
conversation.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.480
The other person doesn't need to think about
some kind of answer, they can just say, "Yes,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.280
it is a gorgeous day.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.600
Oh yes, it is so rainy.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.100
Yes, it's really hot," very simple and it
makes for a comfortable introduction.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.140
If you would like to learn some more ways
to talk about the weather, I made a lesson

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.120
completely dedicated to the weather, a hundred
expressions for talking about the weather.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.100
You can watch that lesson up here to expand
your weather vocabulary.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.760
Our second small talk topic is where you're
at or your location.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.690
Now, you need to think about this, of course,
in an understanding way.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.320
If you are at a hospital, you might not want
to ask these questions, because if you say,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.360
"Do you come here often?" and they're at the
hospital, it might be a little bit too sensitive

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.790
to talk about.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.550
But you can use these questions for any type
of location like a park, the zoo, a library,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.340
a museum walking down the street.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.930
You can use these for most daily life situations.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.140
Let's imagine that you see someone who you've
met a couple of times, but you don't know

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.190
that well.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.700
You might talk about where you're at and you
might ask, "This place is great.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.530
Do you come here often?

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.950
How long have you been coming here?

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.830
Do you live near here?"

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.180
If you're at a dog park, these are pretty
common in the US, people bring their dogs

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.140
and their dogs can run freely together, well
great, you already have something in common

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.010
because that other person probably has a dog,
or if you're at the library, you both have

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.310
an interest in books.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.200
You have something in common, your location,
and you can ask these questions.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.100
"Do you come here often?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.650
How long have you been coming here?

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.880
Do you live near here?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.320
Do you live in the area?"

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.320
Great.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.170
Let's say that you're somewhere that's not
a regular hangout, like a coffee shop or a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.830
library or a park.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.600
Let's imagine that you were at the zoo or
a museum, these kind of a special-occasion

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.440
places, you could ask, "Have you seen the
DaVinci exhibit?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.610
It's really cool," or, "Which exhibit do you
like the most?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.180
Have you seen the monkey exhibit?

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.310
It's amazing."

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.789
You can use this to talk about the location
where you're at.

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.300
What if you're in transit somewhere?

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.120
Maybe you're at an airport, you're at a train
station, you're waiting for your subway to

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120
show up.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.889
Well, what are some questions you could ask
to someone who maybe you don't know and you

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.130
want to start a conversation with?

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.189
You might ask, "So, where are you headed?"

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:56.800
Headed is a verb that we often use to say
which direction are you going to.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.699
"I'm headed to the office.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.770
I'm headed to San Francisco.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.919
I'm headed to some place."

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.400
This is a great question to ask, and I just
want to let you know that if you ask someone

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.370
this and say, "Oh, so where are you headed?"
and they say, "To work," okay, maybe if they're

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.990
not open to conversation.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.889
They just gave you a one-word answer, two-word
answer, that's completely fine.

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.240
Not everyone is going to be open to conversation,
but I've started a lot of great conversations

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.490
and even friendships by trying to just give
it a try.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.060
Try to speak with someone else who you feel
like might be open to having a conversation

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.160
and also respecting other people's distance
if they're not interested.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.900
When you have established that the other person
might be interested in talking, if they say,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.439
"I'm headed to San Francisco," you could ask,
"Are you traveling for business or pleasure?"

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.930
Business is kind of obvious for work, pleasure
might mean they're visiting family or they're

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.650
doing something for fun, for vacation, something
like this.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.139
This is a good way to continue the conversation.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.349
Of course, you have to be aware that if someone
is traveling for a sensitive reason, for example,

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.909
they're going to a funeral, don't push the
topic too much.

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.230
You can just shift your questions accordingly
so that the other person also feels comfortable.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.480
Our third topic for small talk conversation
is to talk about your plans.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.659
You can talk about the past, in the present,
in the future.

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:32.400
In this first scenario, you run into someone
who you kind of know but you maybe don't know

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.150
too well, or you haven't seen them in a little
while.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.699
You can ask them, "Hey, how are you?

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.529
What have you been up to?"

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.669
You don't need to ask, "How are you?"

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:47.419
but it just feels really comfortable and it
introduces the conversation instead of being

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.520
like an interrogation, "Hey, what have you
been up to?"

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.749
Instead, when you say, "Hey, how are you?

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:58.849
What have you been up to?" you can smoothly
introduce the conversation.

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.669
If you haven't seen this person in a while,
you might say, "We have so much to catch up

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:04.669
on.

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.309
What are you up to this weekend?"

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:11.189
This is asking about the future, this future
weekend, "What are you up to?"

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:15.550
Now, of course, if you're asking this, it
means that you would like to get together

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.300
with the other person and catch up.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.689
This phrasal verb, to catch up, means that
you are learning about what has happened to

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:24.520
them in the past.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.779
Maybe you don't know, you haven't seen them
since elementary school, so you have a lot

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.099
to catch up on, you want to know what's going
on in their life.

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:38.520
If you ask this, be prepared to make some
plans and to have some availability, that

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.250
way you can follow through on your question.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.819
You can also ask the informal question, "Do
you want to grab coffee?

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:48.839
Do you want to grab a drink?

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:54.520
Do you want to grab lunch, brunch, dinner,
and catch up?"

00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.280
To grab something, usually we use this in
a very informal situation so that it doesn't

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.990
seem like you need to sit there and talk for
five hours.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:10.190
Instead, you're just going to grab a coffee,
maybe a 30-minute conversation, one-hour conversation,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.789
very informal and spontaneous.

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:19.690
It's also potentially an easier way to not
make someone feel uncomfortable if they say

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.250
no, because it's not so serious.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.940
Just a little note.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:31.539
If you are a guy asking a girl or any combination
I imagine, if you say, "Do you want to grab

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:33.370
coffee with me?"

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:40.150
make sure that you say this very lightly if
you don't want to ask them on a date, because

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:45.591
for me, if a guy tells me this and says, "Hey,
do you want to grab lunch later?" and they

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:49.090
don't know me or they don't know that I'm
married.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.680
Then I will feel really uncomfortable because
is it a date?

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680
Is it not a date?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.410
Do I want to just talk with them?

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:02.120
Make sure that if you are in this situation,
you just ask in a very light and happy manner.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.670
Of course, if you do want to ask them on a
date, this is a good question to ask.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.980
Finally talking about your plans, we have
two very safe questions you can ask.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.550
The first one is, "I can't believe it's already
time for," some kind of holiday, whatever

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.830
holiday is coming up.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.390
"I can't believe it's already time for Thanksgiving.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:27.140
I can't believe it's already time for Christmas,
for the New Year, for spring break.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.130
Do you have any plans?"

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.700
This is asking them about the future, "What
are you going to do for the holiday season?"

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.570
Or you can simply ask, "Do you have any plans
for this weekend?"

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:42.250
Ask it very lightly so they know that you
are just simply asking, "Hey, what are you

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.250
up to this weekend?

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.260
Do you have any plans for this weekend?"

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.360
Great small talk.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.010
Our next small talk topic is a job.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.620
Even if you're talking with someone who you
work with, you can alter these questions slightly

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.090
and still talk about your job with them.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:03.050
In fact, it might be the best option because
it's something that you already have in common.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.900
If you're talking with someone you've never
met before, this is a great question to ask,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.140
"So, what do you do?" or, "So, what do you
do for work?"

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.090
Sometimes we leave off the last part, for
work, and we simply ask, "So, what do you

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.090
do?"

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.090
This might seem a little bit vague for English
learners who've never heard this expression

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.120
before, but it is extremely common.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.620
I want to make sure that when someone asks
you, "So, what do you do?"

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.740
you might say, "What do I do?

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.100
Well, I eat breakfast, I wake up, I breathe.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.180
I like to run."

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.920
No, no, no, this is talking about your job,
what do you do.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.430
Next, you could ask them, "How long have you
been doing this job?

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.020
How long have you been an architect?

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.270
How long have you been a nurse?

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.510
How long have you been a builder?"

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.230
Well, this is great, you're trying to ask
some more details.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.010
If they haven't done that job for very long,
you can follow that up with, "So, what did

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.080
you do before this?"

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.371
What did you do before this, this means this
current job, what was your previous job, or

00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:13.160
maybe you were a student or maybe you were
traveling, what did you do before this.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.230
You might notice that I'm starting a lot of
these questions with the word so.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:24.160
It just provides a smooth entrance to your
question so that it doesn't sound like an

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160
interrogation.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.300
"What do you do?

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.800
How often have you done this?

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800
Where are you coming?

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.430
How often do you come here?"

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.560
If you ask questions like this, the other
person will feel uncomfortable so we often

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.240
add these filler words, like so, to make it
seem more casual and just more natural.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.560
"So, what did you do before this?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.870
So, how long have you done this job?"

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.870
Great idea.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:50.870
If someone really likes their job, you could
ask, "So, what made you get into architecture?

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.180
So, what made you get into teaching?"

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.640
If someone is a teacher, I'm sure they'd love
to share about how they became interested

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.920
in teaching.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:06.140
That's what the essence of this question is,
"So, how did you get into teaching?"

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.730
Especially if you have an unusual job, like
my job, which is to teach you English online,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:17.100
a lot of people ask me this question, "How
did you get into teaching English on YouTube

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.100
and online?"

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:24.040
I tell a little background story about teaching
English in the classroom, and then I was searching

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.870
online for how to teach English in the US
and I found out I could teach English online

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.260
and I just started to dive into it and give
it a try.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.990
This is a little background story to talk
about how I became interested in my current

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.990
job.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.160
Not everybody likes their job though, so if
someone doesn't seem that excited about their

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.620
job and you want to learn more about them,
you could ask them this fun question, which

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:52.130
is, "If money was no object, what job would
you do?"

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:58.410
This means if you didn't need to make money
or you didn't care about how much money you

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.360
had, what kind of job would you have?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.890
This is a classic question and it really gets
to the heart of someone's passion.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:12.860
Maybe they love horses, but they just don't
think they can make a career out of loving

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.860
horses.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.720
They might say, "Oh, I really wish I could
be a horse trainer and teach people how to

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720
ride horses."

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.830
Well, great, all of a sudden you have a treasure,
which is a piece of information about the

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.860
other person.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.870
They love horses, great.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.400
You want to make sure that when you learn
something interesting about other people you

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:38.280
store that away, because it's a great way
to continue conversations or to bring up something

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.460
interesting with them.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:44.030
What if you're talking with someone who you
work with, how can you talk about your job?

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.910
Because you can't ask them, "What do you do?"

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:51.450
Well, I guess, unless you don't really know
what part of the company they work for, but

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.770
in general, we want to ask more specific questions.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.590
Let's imagine this scenario.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:03.410
You are in the lunchroom, most offices in
the US have a break room or lunch room with

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:08.630
some tables and a microwave, maybe a sink,
so that you can heat up your food or wash

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.320
some dishes, and you are waiting for your
food to heat up, you brought some leftover

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320
soup.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.950
This is a very detailed scenario.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.570
You brought some leftover chicken noodle soup
and you put it in the microwave to heat up,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:26.040
but you've got two minutes and there's somebody
who works with you, standing beside you.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040
What do you do?

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040
What do you say?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.710
Don't worry, I'm here to save you.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.780
You can ask these three questions.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:36.040
If you know which department they work in,
you might say, "Hey, what's new in the marketing

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.040
department today?" if they work in marketing.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.070
Or if they work in management, you might say,
"Hey, what's new in management today?"

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.570
Cool, great, you know a little bit about them,
but you're just having some small talk.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:52.110
Or if you know they're working on a project,
you could say, "How's your project going?

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.630
How's your project going?"

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:59.150
Or if you have no idea what they're doing,
you might say, "Do you have any fun or exciting

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.050
projects coming up?"

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.280
You're asking about the future, what kind
of things they're planning for.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.650
Not everybody is great at small talk so they
might just say, "Nope, not much."

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:15.560
Okay, not everybody is willing to have small
talk, but who knows, maybe they'll say, "Yeah,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.150
we're working on this really cool initiative.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.180
We're working with a charity and we're going
to try to raise some funds for this organization,"

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.970
and maybe they're excited about it and will
want to share it.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.750
Maybe they'd just been dying to share this
with someone and you are that opportunity.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.200
It's worth a try, you never know, give small
talk a shot.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.970
Before we go, I want to give you four tips
for excellent small talk.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.970
These are general ideas about conversation,
but they are essential for connecting with

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:42.970
someone else.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.110
Number one is put your phone away.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.130
This seems like a basic thing, right?

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:54.240
But sometimes we don't realize how often we're
opening our phone, checking our messages,

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.470
there's a little buzz and you open your phone.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.340
This is disconnecting you from the person
you're talking with.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.290
When you're trying to have small talk, keep
your phone in your pocket, keep your phone

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.290
away.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:10.550
If you have an emergency or urgent phone call,
you can just say, "Excuse me, I'm sorry.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.260
I have to take this," and that means you have
to talk with that person.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.260
"I'm sorry, it's my boss.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.290
I have to talk with them, I'll be back."

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.940
You have to take that emergency call, but
in general for small talk, keep your phone

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.940
away.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.650
My second tip is to be curious about the other
person.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.550
This is one of the great joys in life, I think,
is getting to know other people and being

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.780
very sincere about getting to know them.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.650
You're not just a robot, blindly asking questions.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:43.860
No, you want to get to know another person,
even if it's just for one minute while you're

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.610
waiting for your food to heat up in the microwave,
that chicken noodle soup, so you can get to

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.610
know someone else.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.610
Be curious.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:59.260
A great way is to ask why or how questions,
"Oh, why did you decide to get this type of

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.260
dog?"

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.850
Or, "How long have you had this dog?"

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.549
Wow, this is a great way to ask further questions.

00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:08.679
Of course, don't interrogate them.

00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:10.289
"Why did you get this dog?

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:11.559
How long have you had him?"

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:17.959
No, you can just be friendly, be yourself,
but these open questions with why and how

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:22.669
show the other person that you are sincerely
interested in their choices in their life.

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:28.940
My third tip is what I just mentioned, which
is do not interrogate to the other person.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.789
Instead, just be genuine and interested in
them.

00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:37.299
If you feel like you're asking too many questions,
do you know what you can do?

00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:39.389
You can share about yourself.

00:17:39.389 --> 00:17:43.769
This is something that's also essential to
do, but not easy for everyone.

00:17:43.769 --> 00:17:49.679
If someone says that they are a math teacher,
you might say, "Oh, you know what?

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:54.190
When I was in high school, I had an awesome
math teacher who was a really special person."

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.019
Okay, that's really short, but you're sharing
some kind of connection from your personal

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:02.559
life and this helps you to not interrogate
them.

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.669
Instead, you're also giving.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:11.139
You're not just taking their answers, instead,
you are giving from yourself as well.

00:18:11.139 --> 00:18:17.820
My fourth tip for great small talk is to avoid
your personal favorite topic.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:24.570
If, for example, you're really into gardening
and growing vegetables, but you have a feeling

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.899
that the other person has no experience with
this, well, you want to keep the conversation

00:18:29.899 --> 00:18:30.899
balanced.

00:18:30.899 --> 00:18:34.679
Of course, you can say, "Yeah, I'm really
into gardening and I've been working hard

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:38.659
to be able to grow lots of kinds of vegetables
in the spring."

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:43.360
Okay, that's great, but if you keep talking
on and on and on about it, well, that's not

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.149
a balanced conversation.

00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:49.580
Of course, you can share what you're interested
in, but make sure that you don't get carried

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.299
away lecturing the other person about your
favorite topic.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.290
All right, well, there you have it.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.929
These are 23 great small talk questions and
four hot tips for how to have great small

00:19:00.929 --> 00:19:01.929
talk.

00:19:01.929 --> 00:19:03.389
Now I have a question for you.

00:19:03.389 --> 00:19:08.330
In the comments below, let me know what question
you're going to ask the next time that you

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.460
have small talk in English.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.001
You can do it, I believe in you.

00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:14.710

me.
