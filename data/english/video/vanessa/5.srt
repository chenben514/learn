Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from&nbsp;
SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.240
Are you ready to understand fast English&nbsp;
speaker conversations? Great. Let's go.&nbsp;

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.600
Speaking English naturally and fluently is a&nbsp;
great skill, but if you can't understand what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.960
other people are saying, you're going to have a&nbsp;
problem. So today, I would like to share with you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.960
my top tip for understanding fast English&nbsp;
conversations. You're going to learn how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.400
to understand fast English, we're going&nbsp;
to practice using this method together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.480
and then I'm going to show you how&nbsp;
you can continue to use this method.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.960
So how can you understand fast English speakers?&nbsp;
Can you learn like a child and just watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.400
the Star Wars Trilogy 500 times and then&nbsp;
eventually, you'll understand it all?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.800
Not really. Instead, we need to use an advanced&nbsp;
method. You need to study and analyze English&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.000
conversations. Then, you need to understand&nbsp;
each word. And finally, you can use that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.240
sentence structure and those words yourself.
And that's what we're going to do today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.960
you're going to analyze a short&nbsp;
real English conversation clip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.440
so get your pen and paper ready. Number one, we&nbsp;
are going to listen to a fast English conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.760
clip. This is the original conversation that I&nbsp;
had with a guy named Jonathan, who is a soccer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.360
or you might say, football referee, and in this&nbsp;
clip, he's going to be talking about one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.720
the worst games that he was ever a referee for.&nbsp;
Second, we're going to listen to a slow version&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.720
of the same clip. So you're going to hear all&nbsp;
of the words that Jonathan said, but they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.280
going to be slow so that you can understand&nbsp;
each and every word. Next, I want you to write&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.560
everything that you hear. You're going to write&nbsp;
from the fast clip, write from the slow clip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.800
try to write every single word that you hear.
And lastly, you're going to check your work with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.880
the original transcript. This way you can see,&nbsp;
oh, I missed that word. It was reduced or it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.640
linked or it was too fast, or maybe it was just&nbsp;
a new word that you'd never heard before, or, oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.400
I did get that word. I didn't even know that, that&nbsp;
was exactly what he said but I wrote it correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.000
That's amazing. So I want you to be active. Listen&nbsp;
to the clips, the fast version, the slow version,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.120
I want you to write, and finally, we're going&nbsp;
to be checking with the original transcript.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.360
This lesson is a sample from my course, the 30&nbsp;
Day English Listening Challenge, where I will send&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.040
one of these listening clips to you every single&nbsp;
day during one month, the month of January 2021.&nbsp;

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.640
So if you enjoyed this lesson, feel free to&nbsp;
join me. This will be open until December&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.560
31st. To join, you can click on the link in&nbsp;
the description. Past students of my listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.240
challenges have said that some days were really&nbsp;
tough and some days were a little bit easier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.960
but over time, they realized, I can understand&nbsp;
more and more what English speakers are saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.880
And I want the same thing for you. I want&nbsp;
you to be able to understand as much as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.480
possible. So let's practice with that right now.
Here is the conversation outline. First, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.040
hear Jonathan's voice, then my voice, then his&nbsp;
voice again. If you have a piece of paper, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.920
recommend writing J, V, J so that you can prepare&nbsp;
yourself for what you're going to hear and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.280
write it in the correct place. This lesson is from&nbsp;
day 21, but today, it is a free sample lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.360
open now from December 22nd to December 31st&nbsp;
for only $30. This means that on January 21st,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.320
you're going to study this lesson, but today,&nbsp;
it's a free sample. Now let's listen to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.200
fast original clip. We're going to listen to it&nbsp;
three times. It is very fast. This is a natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.120
quick conversation. So if it seems too fast, don't&nbsp;
worry, we're going to listen to the slow version&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.160
in just a moment. All right, let's go and listen&nbsp;
to that original conversation three times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.840
Let's listen and try to write at the same time.
Jonathan: So, men's game went great,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.400
and I'm sure I aced that one. And the women's&nbsp;
game's coming up, and it's going to be easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.280
So I went out there, and it wasn't. It was the&nbsp;
worst game I've ever had up until that point.&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.240
Vanessa: No way.
Jonathan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.120
three yellow cards, police were called, and so&nbsp;
I had to terminate the game. I've probably done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.840
you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games, and&nbsp;
I've only terminated maybe five of them.&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.440
So, men's game went great, and I'm sure I aced&nbsp;
that one. And the women's game's coming up, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.120
it's going to be easy. So I went out there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.760
and it wasn't. It was the worst game&nbsp;
I've ever had up until that point.&nbsp;

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.720
Vanessa: No way.
Jonathan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.600
three yellow cards, police were called, and so&nbsp;
I had to terminate the game. I've probably done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.520
you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games, and&nbsp;
I've only terminated maybe five of them.&nbsp;

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.920
So, men's game went great, and I'm sure I aced&nbsp;
that one. And the women's game's coming up, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.680
it's going to be easy. So I went out there, and&nbsp;
it wasn't. It was the worst game I've ever had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.800
up until that point.
Vanessa: No way.&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.240
Jonathan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;
three yellow cards, police were called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.240
and so I had to terminate the game. I've probably&nbsp;
done, you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.880
and I've only terminated maybe five of them.
Vanessa: Did you feel like that was definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.760
too fast? Well, native English speakers and&nbsp;
advanced English learners can understand him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.240
You're going to hear this type of English when&nbsp;
you're traveling to the U.S., when you're having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.800
business meetings, having conversations&nbsp;
with other people, so I want to help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.840
take this in and understand it.
Let's take a deep breath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.320
and we're going to listen to the slow version.&nbsp;
You'll hear me and my husband, Dan, saying the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:34.240
exact same words that you heard me and Jonathan&nbsp;
say, but slowed down a lot. I hope you'll be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.040
to understand each word more clearly. And this is&nbsp;
a great opportunity, if you couldn't write down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.560
all of the words before, now, you can do that. Of&nbsp;
course, feel free to pause this video as you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.440
to so that you can write everything and really&nbsp;
take advantage of this material. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:59.200
let's listen to the slow version three times.
Dan: So, men's game went great,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:08.560
and I'm sure I aced that one. And the women's&nbsp;
game's coming up, and it's going to be easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:18.400
So I went out there, and it wasn't. It was the&nbsp;
worst game I've ever had up until that point.&nbsp;

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.400
Vanessa: No way.
Dan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:34.560
three yellow cards, police were called, and so&nbsp;
I had to terminate the game. I've probably done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:43.840
you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games, and&nbsp;
I've only terminated maybe five of them.&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:56.080
So, men's game went great, and I'm sure I aced&nbsp;
that one. And the women's game's coming up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:06.000
and it's going to be easy. So I went out there,&nbsp;
and it wasn't. It was the worst game I've ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.360
had up until that point.
Vanessa: No way.&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:17.280
Dan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;
three yellow cards, police were called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.800
and so I had to terminate the&nbsp;
game. I've probably done, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:33.280
eight, nine, 10,000 games, and I've&nbsp;
only terminated maybe five of them.&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:46.480
So, men's game went great, and I'm sure I aced&nbsp;
that one. And the women's game's coming up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:56.400
and it's going to be easy. So I went out there,&nbsp;
and it wasn't. It was the worst game I've ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.760
had up until that point.
Vanessa: No way.&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:08.960
Dan: I had, I think, five red cards, three&nbsp;
yellow cards, police were called, and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:18.880
I had to terminate the game. I've probably&nbsp;
done, you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:26.560
and I've only terminated maybe five of them.
Vanessa: Did you write everything you heard? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.520
if you join the 30 Day English Listening&nbsp;
Challenge, you'll be able to download each of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.680
the lessons each day and go back and review it as&nbsp;
many times as you want. But for this lesson, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.120
can just pause the video if you need to go back.&nbsp;
So how was this? Was it too fast? Did the slow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.880
version help you? We're going to go on to the next&nbsp;
step, which is taking a look at the transcript&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.800
and trying to learn some new words with&nbsp;
this. There are three new words that you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.440
going to learn in each lesson every day, but&nbsp;
we're also going to be taking a look at some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.920
trouble sections that might have been difficult&nbsp;
for you. Let's take a look at the transcript.&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.360
So here, you have the transcript of our&nbsp;
conversation. I'm going to read it slowly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.200
and then go through different things&nbsp;
that you can learn from this short clip.&nbsp;

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.320
First, Jonathan says, "So, men's game went&nbsp;
great, and I'm sure I aced that one." You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.440
can see at the bottom, there are three vocabulary&nbsp;
words that I want you to learn with each lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.200
and this is one of them, to ace something. That&nbsp;
means that you did a great job. You might say I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.920
aced my test, or I aced my first day on the job&nbsp;
because I did really well. So you're talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.920
about doing well. So he did a great job being a&nbsp;
referee for the men's game. But then something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.480
bad is going to happen. Let's go on to his next&nbsp;
sentence, "And the women's game's coming up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.800
and it's going to be easy." He uses another great&nbsp;
expression, to come up. This is talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:01.680
something that's happening soon. My birthday&nbsp;
is coming up, or Christmas is coming up. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.400
new year is coming up. It's going to be happening&nbsp;
soon. It's coming up, and it's going to be easy.&nbsp;

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:14.080
Let's take a moment to look at the grammar&nbsp;
of this sentence. He says the women's game is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:22.320
coming up. It is going to be easy. Is he being a&nbsp;
referee right then as I'm having that conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.840
with him? You can imagine, probably not. This is&nbsp;
talking about something that happened in the past,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:36.960
but why does he use the present tense? The game is&nbsp;
coming up. It is going to be easy. Well, this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.280
storytelling technique in English that sometimes,&nbsp;
we use the present tense to talk about something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.200
that happened in the past to make the listener&nbsp;
feel like they're right there in the action as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.240
it's happening. So we go back and forth between&nbsp;
the present and the past tense when telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.880
a story, and that's what he does in his next&nbsp;
sentence. He uses the past tense. Let's move on.&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.320
"So I went out there, and it wasn't." He went&nbsp;
out to the soccer or football field and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:14.320
wasn't easy. "It was the worst game I've ever had&nbsp;
up until that point." So he's contrasting the men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.520
and the women's game. The men's game went great,&nbsp;
but the women's game was the worst game he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:29.040
ever had. I put a little star here beside the word&nbsp;
I've because this is actually incorrect grammar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:36.800
He should have said it was the worst game&nbsp;
I had ever had up until that point. But I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:44.080
wanted to highlight this because native speakers&nbsp;
sometimes make mistakes when they're speaking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.520
but they're still understandable, especially when&nbsp;
you're speaking quickly or using a complex verb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:56.240
tense, like have ever had, or had ever had. That&nbsp;
can be a little complex, and when you're speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:02.080
quickly, sometimes, you're not thinking about it.&nbsp;
So I hope this gives you some peace of mind that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.160
sometimes, we make mistakes as well.
All right, let's go on to the short phrase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:13.280
that I say. In response to his explanation&nbsp;
about the worst game, I said, "No way."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:21.360
Am I disagreeing with him? No. I wasn't there&nbsp;
for that game. I'm not disagreeing with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:27.920
I'm just expressing shock. So we often use this&nbsp;
expression to just say, I'm shocked. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.400
if you are walking down the street, like down here&nbsp;
in the vocabulary section, and you find $20 on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.080
sidewalk, you might tell your friend, "I found&nbsp;
$20 on the sidewalk." And your friend would say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.400
"No way." They're not disagreeing&nbsp;
with you, they're just saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.840
that's shocking, that's amazing. So&nbsp;
they're being shocked at what you said.&nbsp;

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.680
All right, let's go on to the last part of the&nbsp;
conversation. Jonathan says, "I had, I think, five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:02.880
red cards, three yellow cards, police were called,&nbsp;
and so I had to terminate the game. I've probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:10.000
done, you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games,&nbsp;
and I've only terminated maybe five of them."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:18.160
Here, he uses some interesting filler words. He&nbsp;
says I think, five red cards, and then later on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.880
he says, I've probably done, you know, eight,&nbsp;
nine, 10,000 games. This is quite common for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.760
conversation that we add into our speech these&nbsp;
kinds of filler expressions. It's very casual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.360
It's very comfortable, and it's quite normal.
So if you didn't understand everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.520
Jonathan said during the fast version,&nbsp;
or even during the slow version,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.480
it's possible that it's because he used some&nbsp;
new vocabulary for you. So I hope that today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.560
you're able to learn that new vocabulary.
What we're going to do now is we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.080
to go back, listen to that original fast&nbsp;
version, but this time, we're going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.760
looking at the transcript that we just studied.&nbsp;
I want you to listen for his words and also read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.360
them at the same time. I think you'll be pretty&nbsp;
amazed that you're actually understanding more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.560
than the first time, because you've studied&nbsp;
the fast version, the slow version, you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.800
analyzed that clip with me so you know some of the&nbsp;
different things that are happening, and now, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.120
can finally listen to it and your ears are opened.&nbsp;
So, let's listen to that fast clip a couple times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.080
and I want you to be amazed. Let's watch.
Jonathan: So, men's game went great, and I'm sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:39.840
I aced that one. And the women's game's coming up,&nbsp;
and it's going to be easy. So I went out there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.160
and it wasn't. It was the worst game&nbsp;
I've ever had up until that point.&nbsp;

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.200
Vanessa: No way.
Jonathan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:54.080
three yellow cards, police were called, and so&nbsp;
I had to terminate a game. I've probably done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.000
you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games, and&nbsp;
I've only terminated maybe five of them.&nbsp;

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.200
So, men's game went great,&nbsp;
and I'm sure I aced that one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.840
And the women's game's coming&nbsp;
up, and it's going to be easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.560
So I went out there, and it wasn't. It was the&nbsp;
worst game I've ever had up until that point.&nbsp;

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.520
Vanessa: No way.
Jonathan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:24.480
three yellow cards, police were called, and so&nbsp;
I had to terminate a game. I've probably done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.400
you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games, and&nbsp;
I've only terminated maybe five of them.&nbsp;

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:36.560
So, men's game went great, and I'm sure I aced&nbsp;
that one. And the women's game's coming up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:44.240
and it's going to be easy. So I went out there,&nbsp;
and it wasn't. It was the worst game I've ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.600
had up until that point.
Vanessa: No way.&nbsp;

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.040
Jonathan: I had, I think, five red cards,&nbsp;
three yellow cards, police were called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:57.040
and so I had to terminate a game. I've probably&nbsp;
done, you know, eight, nine, 10,000 games,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.360
and I've only terminated maybe five of them.
Vanessa: How did you do? Did you understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:09.600
more? I hope so. Now imagine if you could study&nbsp;
a clip like this every single day for 30 days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:16.080
how much would your listening improve over that&nbsp;
month? A lot. Thousands of English learners have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.480
joined me for the 30-Day Listening Challenge, pack&nbsp;
one, pack two, pack three, pack four, and now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:28.000
we are on to pack five. Students in this&nbsp;
course have said that some of the speakers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.520
some of the days, some of the clips were more&nbsp;
challenging, others were a little bit easier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.520
but by analyzing one of these clips every single&nbsp;
day, they were amazed that their listening skills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.120
and vocabulary were improving each day. If you&nbsp;
decide to join this course, you're going to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.640
11 different English speakers, and this way,&nbsp;
you'll be exposed different ways of speaking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.600
different styles of speech and vocabulary,&nbsp;
and grammar and pronunciation as well.&nbsp;

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.160
The most important thing is that these&nbsp;
clips are from real conversations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.280
so you will of course improve your listening&nbsp;
skills, but more importantly than that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.080
you'll be able to use this in the real world,&nbsp;
which is the purpose for learning English, right?&nbsp;

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:17.680
Until December 31st, 2020, the 30-Day English&nbsp;
Listening Challenge pack five will be open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.840
for enrollment for only $30. If you haven't&nbsp;
joined pack one, two, three, or four,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.560
that's okay. Each pack is its own individual&nbsp;
course. They are the same style of lessons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.680
but they feature totally different speakers and&nbsp;
different topics. And of course, if you would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.440
like to join all of them together, there will be&nbsp;
a discount for joining all five packs at one time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:48.080
Each lesson should only take five to 15 minutes&nbsp;
to study every day. You're going to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.920
four of these lesson materials. The original&nbsp;
fast clip, the slow clip, the worksheet, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.680
also the transcript each day. Because you'll be&nbsp;
learning three new expressions with each lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:05.200
you're going to learn 90 new expressions by the&nbsp;
end of the month, increasing your vocabulary.&nbsp;

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.040
Let's take a quick sneak peek into the course&nbsp;
website. When you join the 30-Day Listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:18.320
Challenge pack five, you'll get access to&nbsp;
this page. Today is day zero. Any day before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:25.120
January 1st is day zero. Let's see what you&nbsp;
can access today. You'll find a course guide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:31.920
with my recommended study plan for each day and&nbsp;
a calendar so that you can check off each day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:38.560
when you finish. On day one, January 1st,&nbsp;
you'll have access to the day one lesson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.800
which you can download or stream on the&nbsp;
website. Then on January 2nd, you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.440
have access to the day two lesson, etc, etc.
