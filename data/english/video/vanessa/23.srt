00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Hi.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.160
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.500
Do you want to visit the US?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.680
Here's what you need to know.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.580
Have you already visited the US?

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.880
Would you like to visit the US someday?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.670
Going to an English-speaking country is a
great way to get motivated or stay motivated

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.689
to learn English.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.460
I asked you all in the community tab here
on YouTube where you would like to visit in

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.000
the US, and a lot of you said LA, San Francisco,
New York, Chicago, Florida, Texas, Boston,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.420
a lot of places.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.940
I hope your dreams come true and you get to
come visit the US.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.040
To help you prepare, today I'd like to give
you 10 important facts that you need to know

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.960
before you come to visit the US.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.510
Of course, these are all my opinion and just
from my experience, but sometimes it's important

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.270
to know the cultural differences or what to
expect before you go somewhere.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.440
All right, let's start with the first category,
which is airports.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.219
Number one, Airports are not the best representation
of the US.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.690
Every time that I've landed in the US coming
from a foreign country, I've always had an

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.630
unpleasant experience.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.780
Unfortunately, this is kind of a negative
way to start our list today.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.950
But, often I've heard people just say, "Get
in this line.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.040
Go over there.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.040
Hurry up.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.090
Let's go," or maybe that was just the Atlanta
airport.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.980
But no, I experienced that in Chicago, New
York, DC, a lot of places.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.620
So if you have a kind of negative experience
in an airport when you first land in the US,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.780
take a deep breath.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.900
This isn't a good representation of American
people.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.060
I remember arriving back in the US from Korea,
and in front of us in line at the customs

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.330
office, or something like that, was this kind
Korean grandpa.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.690
I imagine he hardly spoke any English.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.110
At least when he tried to communicate with
other people, it seemed a little bit difficult.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.900
And when the customs officer was talking with
him, he kept just speaking louder and louder

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.420
and not really trying to understand or help
him.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.090
I felt really bad that this was this man's
first exposure to the US, and I hoped that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.190
he would have other pleasant experiences with
other people on his visit.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.280
I hope that's the same for you.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.710
If you have a negative experience, this is
just an airport thing.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.910
I hope that you meet other people who are
friendly.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.360
Tips number two and three are about restaurants.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.230
Do you use TripAdvisor when you want to look
for new restaurants?

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.200
Do you think that Americans use TripAdvisor
when they want to find a new restaurant or

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.860
a good restaurant in their city?

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.190
Nope.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.060
Every American I know uses Yelp.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.300
If you want to find local places that local
people have recommended, download the Yelp

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300
app.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300
This video is not sponsored by Yelp.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.000
It's just a common thing that we use here
in the US.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.980
Download the Yelp app and search for restaurants
in your area or if you need to get a haircut

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.430
maybe hairdressers in your area.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.380
TripAdvisor might be good for sightseeing,
maybe some landmarks or things like that.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.840
But for restaurants or bars, for food, these
types of things, we always use Yelp, so make

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.130
sure that you use what local people are using,
which is Yelp.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.870
Tip number three, if you go to a restaurant
or bar, you need to tip 20% if your service

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.390
was adequate or good.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.990
If it was terrible, absolutely awful service,
you don't have to tip it all.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.610
You could give them 10%.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.610
That's up to you.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.630
But if the service was at least normal, you
need to give them 20%.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.590
In the US, the tip constitutes an essential
part of the server's wage.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.620
In fact, the server's only money that they're
getting are tips, so you need to give 20%.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.209
An easy way to calculate this is if your bill
was $32, take that first number, three, multiply

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.860
it by two, which is six.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.670
And there you have 20%.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.310
$6 is 20% of 32.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.770
So you can add that together, and your total
bill is $38.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.860
You need to do this also when you get a drink
at a bar.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.790
Typically, 20% is acceptable.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.260
But if 20% is like 30 cents, the best thing
to do is still to give a dollar.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.380
A dollar is the minimum tip that is polite.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.210
I've been a server a lot, especially when
I was in high school, when I was in college

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.290
as part-time jobs, and if somebody left change
on the table, which are coins, you felt like

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.910
they were just trying to be rude to you.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.600
Because in American culture, if you leave
coins, just coins ... Of course, if it's a

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.050
big pile of coins, who cares?

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.460
It's a lot of money still.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.210
But just a couple coins, it feels a little
bit rude, so make sure that you give them

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.710
at least a dollar.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.190
When you take a taxi, tip 20%.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.380
For Uber, I don't use Uber that much.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.820
But from what I've heard, it's not required
to tip with Uber.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:03.620
Uber drivers are paid a regular hourly salary
or per ride that they get, so you don't need

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.070
to tip, but you can always tip.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.510
It has always accepted.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.630
Tip number four is about transportation.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.280
I recommend renting a car when you visit the
US, unless you're only going to stay in the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.400
middle of the city center, like in New York
or San Francisco, really close, because the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.960
US is spread out.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.250
Even in LA, which is a huge city, it's hard
to get from one side to the other.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.419
Or if you want to visit Yosemite National
Park, that's going to be a four-hour drive

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.960
from San Francisco, so you're going to need
a car because Uber's not going to take you

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960
that far.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.820
So, just think about your trip and realize
that the US is really big, really spread out,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.970
so you'll probably want a budget for renting
a car when you come to visit.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:57.460
Tip number five has four different parts because
alcohol in the US is a little complicated.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.400
If you buy alcohol in the US, don't be surprised
if the person who's selling you the alcohol

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.410
asks to see your ID.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:11.040
In the US, it is very strict that you must
be 21 years old to buy alcohol.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.699
And if someone looks under the age of 40,
the person selling you alcohol will say, "Can

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.480
I see your ID?"

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.850
Even if you're 50 years old, maybe even 60,
they might ask to see your ID.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.740
So, don't be shocked about this.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.990
In fact, sometimes Americans get a little
bit offended if the other person doesn't ask

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.280
to see their ID.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.180
So for me, I'm 31.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.949
Yes, I'm 31.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.130
I'm 31.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.020
One time I went to the store and the cashier
didn't ask to see my ID, and I thought, "Do

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.040
I look like I'm 40 years old?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.419
Oh, no.

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.920
Maybe I look older than I am."

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.090
But really, the cashier said, "Oh, you come
in here a lot.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.500
I know you," so it wasn't really a negative
situation.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.430
But, sometimes people feel a little bit offended
in this situation.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.430
Quite interesting.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.690
So, make sure you have your ID ready.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:08.840
Tip 5.1 about alcohol is that the person buying
alcohol needs an ID, but sometimes in some

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.320
stores in some states the cashier will ask
to see everyone's ID who is present.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.050
So if you're with your husband buying alcohol
... This happened to me.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.620
We were at the grocery store, and we were
buying a bottle of wine.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.230
He was paying for it.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.009
It's our money, but it was him who was making
the transaction.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.639
The cashier asked to see my ID, too.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.510
This happened to me only two times.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.600
One time I had my ID.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
No problem.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.080
The second time I didn't have my ID, and she
just said, "It's okay.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080
Don't worry about it."

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.350
So, I guess this isn't too strict.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:48.639
But maybe if I had looked 16 years old or
15 years old, maybe they wouldn't have sold

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:54.759
it because they don't want someone who is
above 21 to be buying alcohol for someone

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:55.759
who's a minor.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:00.250
We say a minor for someone who is under 21
years old because they're not allowed to drink

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.650
alcohol.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.520
Do you think that people who are under 21
drink alcohol in the US?

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.620
If you've ever seen a movie about colleges,
the answer is definitely yes.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.169
But, stores have to kind of follow these types
of rules.

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:18.800
Tip 5.2 about alcohol is that in some states
you cannot buy alcohol at the grocery store.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.419
It's kind of a state law that you have to
go to a specific alcohol store to buy alcohol.

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:27.180
This is called an ABC store.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.639
So if you're driving and you see an ABC store,
and you're visiting somewhere like Pennsylvania,

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:36.800
if you go to Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, I'm
sure other states are like this too, you cannot

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.639
buy alcohol at the grocery store.

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:44.869
Sometimes there's specific grocery stores
that have a little section where you can buy

00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:47.459
beer and you have to pay for it in that section.

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:50.560
You can't pay for it with all your groceries.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.660
Just check out this.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.930
Check about this in advance to make sure that
if you're going to the store you can actually

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.060
get what you want to get.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:04.059
Tip 5.3 about alcohol is that in some states
you cannot buy alcohol on Sunday before a

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:05.059
certain time.

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:10.019
So in my state, in North Carolina, you cannot
buy alcohol before noon on Sunday.

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:14.209
One time, I went to the store to prepare and
get a bunch of stuff for a big dinner that

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:16.509
I was having on Sunday night at my house.

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:17.809
I was getting lots of food.

00:09:17.809 --> 00:09:20.050
I was getting some wine, some beer.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.040
And when I went to buy everything, the cashier
said, "Oh, I'm sorry.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.040
It's 11:45.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.319
I can't sell you alcohol until noon," so I
just waited in the grocery store for 15 minutes

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:35.149
until noon and then I could buy it.

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:43.589
I think that this rule kind of goes back to
the idea that you should go to church instead

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:44.740
of drinking.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.560
I'm not sure exactly.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.259
But I'll let you know something, it doesn't
work.

00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:52.569
It doesn't stop people from drinking whenever
they want.

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:56.569
But you might encounter this, so just make
sure you think about it in advance.

00:09:56.569 --> 00:10:03.429
Tip 5.4 about alcohol is that you cannot drink
in public places like the park or on the street.

00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:07.470
The beach is a little bit different sometimes
depending on the state.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:13.069
And of course, some beaches might be more
isolated or a lot of people drink there, so

00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:17.290
they're a little bit more relaxed about the
rules, so just look this up before you go.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:22.610
Because if you're going to a really popular
beach in Miami or a popular beach in California,

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.399
the rules are probably going to be different.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:28.439
And if you want to drink a beer on the beach,
you want to be able to do that without worrying

00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:30.660
that someone's going to stop you from doing
that.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.319
So, just look up the rules in advance or ask
your friends if they live in those areas.

00:10:35.319 --> 00:10:41.649
After hearing about all of those alcohol rules,
is it any wonder that America gets called

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:42.649
puritanical?

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:44.560
I don't really think so.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.389
Let's go on to the next category.

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:49.310
The sixth tip is about people.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.139
Unlike the airport, I've heard from a lot
of visitors to the US that American people

00:10:54.139 --> 00:10:59.649
are generally friendlier and smilier than
they imagined.

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:05.959
I've heard American's often described as a
peach that on the outside we're soft and easy

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:07.110
to get to know.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.160
Maybe the first time we meet you we'll invite
you to our house for dinner.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.939
That's not uncommon.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:18.019
But maybe after we have dinner, if we have
a great time, I might not call you for another

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:19.790
month to get together again.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.589
It doesn't mean that I don't like you.

00:11:21.589 --> 00:11:26.420
It just means that maybe it's not a priority
to get together right away, so there's some

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.320
kind of hard center.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.249
Maybe that's just a generality, of course.

00:11:30.249 --> 00:11:36.661
But, I think that when you walk down the street,
especially in medium-sized cities ... If you

00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:39.679
smile at everybody in New York, it's going
to be a little bit weird.

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:44.569
But if you're in a smaller or medium-sized
city like where I live, if I walk past someone

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:46.869
on the sidewalk, I'll make eye contact.

00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:48.430
I might say hey.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.430
Maybe.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.430
Depends.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.430
But, it's not unusual.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:56.619
If you did that in a really big city, people
might think it's a little bit weird.

00:11:56.619 --> 00:12:00.399
But, don't be surprised if people are pretty
friendly, pretty smiley.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:03.500
That's kind of the typical stereotype of the
US.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.930
Personally, I think it's kind of true.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.619
Tip number seven is about health.

00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:14.249
The US gets a pretty bad reputation for having
expensive health care, and it's 100% true,

00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:15.249
unfortunately.

00:12:15.249 --> 00:12:19.600
So if you're in the US and you have some kind
of minor health problem, like you need an

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.879
antibiotic or you need a couple stitches,
I recommend go into a place like a MedExpress.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:31.189
This is the brand of this type of clinic,
but there's other brand names of that as well.

00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:37.860
But, it's a kind of fast emergency room-type
service, but it's not the hospital emergency

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.860
room.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.009
If you go to the emergency room at the hospital,
that should be for serious issues.

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:47.389
That's going to cost several thousand dollars
minimum.

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:52.429
But if you go to a MedExpress, you can walk
in, you can see a doctor usually within an

00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:57.100
hour, and your visit will probably be less
than $200.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.949
That's what I do whenever I need something
quick and I don't want to ... Especially if

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:06.470
I'm in a different city where I don't have
a personal doctor there, I'll just go to a

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.470
MedExpress and it's a kind of quick fix.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.639
If you're really concerned that something
serious might happen while you're traveling

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:18.199
in the US and you don't want to have to go
to the ER and pay full price for something,

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:19.989
you can always get travel insurance.

00:13:19.989 --> 00:13:25.490
I don't have any personal experience with
buying travel insurance for the US because

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:30.160
I'm a US citizen and I've bought it for traveling
to other countries, but you can always type

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.670
into Google travel insurance for visiting
the US or something like that, and you could

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.529
probably find some companies that will give
you short-term insurance for one week or two

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:41.290
weeks when you're visiting.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.480
That way you can kind of feel at ease that
if something happens you won't have to pay

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.609
a lot of money.

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:48.910
Tip number eight is about sleeping.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.759
Of course you could stay in a hotel when you
visit the US, but it's really a great experience

00:13:53.759 --> 00:14:00.579
to stay at an AirBnB so that you can experience
a real American home and feel a little more

00:14:00.579 --> 00:14:03.429
comfortable and at ease during your experience.

00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:08.920
If you've never used AirBnB, this is a service
where homeowners can rent out one room in

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.589
their house, their full house.

00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:17.540
Or maybe they have a basement apartment so
you're kind of in a private area and the people

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.720
who run this, they live upstairs, something
like this.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.779
You have access to bedrooms, you have access
to the kitchen, and usually you have access

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:28.739
to your own living space so you can feel a
little more comfortable.

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:31.259
And if you would like, you can always talk
with the host.

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:32.259
You don't have to.

00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:35.040
You can just send them a message and they'll
tell you how to get in.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.149
But if you would like to get tips or advice
from the host, it's a great opportunity.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:45.529
Usually they have a little notebook of ideas
sitting in your AirBnB room so that you can

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:46.939
see their personal recommendations.

00:14:46.939 --> 00:14:48.629
But, you can always talk with them.

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:56.610
You kind of have this personal one-on-one
advice travel tour guide who you're connected

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.359
with no matter where you're staying when you
stay at this type of place.

00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:04.940
It's especially good if you have kids, because,
for me, I have a toddler, and he goes to bed

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.540
pretty early, like 7:00, 7:30.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.959
And usually at 7:30 I don't want to go to
bed.

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:15.089
But if you have a hotel room, there's nowhere
else you can go.

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:17.040
He's sleeping in the same room.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.440
So when you have an AirBnB, he can sleep in
the bedroom and you can still spend time in

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.499
the kitchen, spend time in the living space,
and you're a little bit separated in that

00:15:25.499 --> 00:15:26.499
way.

00:15:26.499 --> 00:15:28.230
Personally, I really love staying in these
types of places.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.959
Just make sure that you read a lot of reviews
and you write a nice message to the host so

00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:36.559
that they feel comfortable hosting you and
letting you into their home.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:38.309
Tip number nine is about safety.

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:43.679
Despite what you see in the media about shootings
and all of this, the US is generally pretty

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:44.679
safe.

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:47.999
Of course, there's going to be specific areas,
specific streets that you don't want to walk

00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:53.429
on, but it's generally a good idea to walk
around the city center.

00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:57.500
I recommend being alert and aware as you're
walking.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.499
Don't listen to music and look at the ground.

00:15:59.499 --> 00:16:00.749
Look around you.

00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:05.720
Look alert so that if there is a bad person
in the area you're not an easy target.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.299
You're alert and aware.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:11.980
For me, I generally don't walk around after
it gets dark in my city.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:18.049
I live in a pretty small city, but I don't
feel comfortable walking around by myself

00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:19.049
at night.

00:16:19.049 --> 00:16:22.799
So when I go somewhere after dark, I drive
my car to the destination.

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:26.319
I get out of my car, and I walk inside to
that place.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.040
I don't just wander around at night.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:35.129
If you come from somewhere that is extremely
safe, theft, murder, robbery, all of these

00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:41.569
things are uncommon, I'm looking at you Korea
and Japan, just be extra cautious because

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:45.060
maybe you're not used to keeping your purse
with you.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.209
When you go to a coffee shop, maybe you leave
your purse when you go to the bathroom.

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:52.879
In the US, we don't do that.

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:56.540
So make sure that you're just a little bit
extra aware, but you don't have to be scared

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.639
or worried.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:01.329
Just be alert, aware, and try to stay with
someone else if you can.

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:03.329
Tip number 10 is about English.

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:05.070
Let's end this video on a good note.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.500
So if you visit the US, you definitely need
to use English.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.520
I imagine if you're watching this you are
a non-native English speaker because this

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.180
channel is for learning English.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.959
So if you visit the US, make sure that you
have a little bit prepared, mainly just some

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:25.290
basics so that you can order at restaurants
or ask some questions about safety, these

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.280
kind of standard things.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.510
But overall, if you really want to use English
and you want to interact with other people,

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.610
this is a good chance to do it.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.230
Unfortunately, most Americans whose families
have immigrated from other countries several

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.430
generations ago, they don't speak that native
language anymore.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.960
They only speak English.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.400
This happened with my family.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.040
My great grandparents came from Italy.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.690
My grandma can understand some Italian.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.670
My dad remembers Italian food, but he doesn't
speak any Italian, and me neither.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:03.350
So in this situation, we have lost the ability
to speak Italian, even though I have some

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.180
Italian heritage.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:11.940
So if you are from Vietnam and you're visiting
Portland, if you're from Brazil and you're

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.230
visiting Texas, you're probably not going
to find people who speak your native language,

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.950
so it's really important to use English.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:24.630
Two years ago, I made a travel survival series
here on YouTube along with a free PDF of all

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.910
of the expressions that I talked about in
that travel survival series.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.970
You can click up here to watch that survival
series or you can click the link in the description

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.800
to download that PDF so that when you visit
the US you can study all of those expressions

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.180
and hopefully it will help to encourage you
to use English and use what you're learning.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.030
So are you ready to visit the US?

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.380
I hope that all of these tips made you feel
excited, feel pumped about visiting the US.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.180
Let me know in the comments.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.320
If you have already visited the US, where
did you go?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.120
And if you would like to visit the US someday,
where would you like to go?

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.500
I hope that your dream comes true and you
get to visit.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.370
