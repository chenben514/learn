Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.220
Are you ready to test your listening skills?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.410
Let's get started.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.000
Today, I'm gonna test your listening skills.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.279
Do you wanna understand fast native speakers
in movies, in TV shows and in regular daily

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.869
conversations, yes.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.519
There are countless reductions, and linking
in spoken English, so the best way to study

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.729
this is to study real conversations, and that's
what we're gonna do.

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.110
You're gonna hear five short conversations.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.480
And for each conversation, you're gonna see
three words.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.540
What I want you to do is, I want you to listen
carefully for which word is used in that conversation.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.010
These conversations are all the 30 Day English
Listening Challenge, pack three, that will

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.510
come out on December 20th, 2018, so make sure
that you have downloaded my free e-book to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.400
get some email updates about that.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.120
We'll talk more about that next week.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.190
Are you ready for the first conversation?

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.299
I want you to listen carefully for the world,
all right, although or almost.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.950
Which word do you hear in the conversation?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.950
Let's listen.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.389
Dan: I have my own phone.

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:16.670
We don't share these things.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.020
Although, for a time we did share a smartphone.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.030
I have my own phone.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.310
We don't share these things.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.020
Although, for a time we did share a smartphone.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.909
Vanessa: Which word did you hear, although,
all right, almost?

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.049
I hope that you heard the word although.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.119
Dan used the word although to contrast to
something that he previously said.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.189
He said that we have our own phones.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.950
We don't share a phone.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.420
But, in the past, we did a share a phone.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.929
So he said, "Although, in the past we shared
a phone."

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.880
He's showing that he's contrasting between
something that's happening now and something

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.130
that used to happen before.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.569
So, let's listen again to that quick conversation.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.880
We're gonna listen to the key sentence, and
I want you to listen for the word although.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.990
Dan: I have my own phone.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.270
We don't share these things.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.610
Although, for a time we did share a smartphone.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.630
I have my own phone.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.910
We don't share these things.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.500
Although, for a time we did share a smartphone.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.650
Vanessa: Did you hear that keyword, although?

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.230
I hope so.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.160
Let's move on to the second conversation and
I want you to listen for three key words,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.110
interested, eager or involved.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.480
Which one do you hear?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480
Let's listen.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.830
Faith: I was just really shy and timid, and
it was hard for my mom because she wanted

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.830
to get me involved in things.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.890
I was just really shy and timid, and it was
hard for my mom because she wanted to get

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.060
me involved in things.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.170
Vanessa: Which word did you hear, interested,
eager or involved?

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.980
I hope you heard the word involved.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.560
In this conversation, Faith said this keyword,
involved, pretty quickly.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.220
She explains that when she was younger she
was really shy, but her mom wanted to encourage

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.390
her to participate events or, we could say,
to get involved.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.510
It means to participate in events.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.230
I also used another word, optimum, that I
talked about in a recent vocabulary quiz here

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.230
on my YouTube channel.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.600
You can watch it up here, if you'd like to
learn more about that word.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.450
Let's listen to the key sentence again, and
I want you to listen for the word involved.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.480
Faith: I was just really shy and timid, and
it was hard for my mom because she wanted

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.480
to get me involved in things.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.530
I was just really shy and timid, and it was
hard for my mom because she wanted to get

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.630
me involved in things.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.260
Vanessa: Did you hear that word?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.730
I hope so.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.150
Let's move on to conversation number three.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.650
You're gonna be listening for one of these
three words, challenge, change or child.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.920
Which one is in the conversation?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920
Let's listen.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.920
Brad: Well, I think visiting family is a wonderful
thing, and part of what makes it so wonderful

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.440
is getting to see them change and grow every
time you see them.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.840
Well, I think visiting family is a wonderful
thing, and part of what makes it so wonderful

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.000
is getting to see them change and grow every
time you see them.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.690
Vanessa: Which word did you hear, challenge,
change or child?

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.070
I hope you heard the word change.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.380
In this conversation, Brad said that he loves
to visit family occasionally.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.060
Occasionally means, maybe three times a year,
not every day, because he enjoys seeing how

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.630
things are different each time when he sees
his family.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.770
Things have changed each time when he sees
his family.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.270
Let's listen to that clip one more time.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.880
I want you to hear that keyword change, so
we'll listen to that sentence.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:05.190
Brad: Well, I think visiting family is a wonderful
thing, and part of what makes it so wonderful

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.710
is getting to see them change and grow every
time you see them.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:16.100
Well, I think visiting family is a wonderful
thing, and part of what makes it so wonderful

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.290
is getting to see them change and grow every
time you see them.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.220
Vanessa: Did you hear the word change?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.240
I hope so.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.240
Let's go on to the fourth conversation.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.260
We're gonna be listening for one of these
three words, teen, two or ten.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.410
These are number related words, so listen
carefully.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.580
So how did you start this?

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.280
Let's start at the very beginning.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.150
How did you get into massage therapy?

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.930
Sarah: I became a massage therapist about
10 years ago.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.860
Vanessa: So how did you start this?

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.550
Let's start at the very beginning.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.650
How did you get into massage therapy?

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.960
Sarah: I became a massage therapist about
10 years ago.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.840
Vanessa: Which word did you hear?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.110
I hope you heard that Sarah has been a massage
therapist, some who gives massages, for how

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.110
many years?

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.110
10 years.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.650
I hope you heard the word ten.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.110
Listening for numbers is essential in conversation.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.510
So if you'd like to practice pronouncing some
of the most difficult numbers, you can watch

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.070
this lesson which is How to Pronounce the
Top 33 Most Difficult Words.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.930
Let's listen to that key sentence again and
see if you can hear the word ten.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.100
So how did you start this?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.800
Let's start at the very beginning.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.660
How did you get into massage therapy?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.449
Sarah: I became a massage therapist about
10 years ago.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.390
Vanessa: So how did you start this?

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.080
Let's start at the very beginning.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.180
How did you get into massage therapy?

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.440
Sarah: I became a massage therapist about
10 years ago.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.520
Vanessa: Did you hear the word ten?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.740
I hope so.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.840
Let's move on to the fifth and final listening
quiz question, which I think is the most tricky

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.900
so listen carefully for the word especially,
specifically or special.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.910
Let's listen.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.790
Anna: My mom co-owned a horse for a little
while.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.190
A lot of people go in on one together so that
you don't have to pay all of the expenses,

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.729
especially with any vet calls that might happen.

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:24.729
My mom co-owned a horse for a little while.

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:29.990
A lot of people go in on one together so that
you don't have to pay all of the expenses,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.760
especially with any vet calls that might happen.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.199
Vanessa: Which word did you hear?

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:39.310
Did you hear the word especially?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.210
This is technically the correct word.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.620
But in this conversation Anna uses a common
spoken reduction for the word especially.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.120
She cuts off the E at the beginning and she
says 'specially, 'specially.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120
This is pretty common.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.430
It might be a little bit tricky to hear the
first time around.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.390
We'll listen to it again in just a moment
so that you can hear it.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.199
Listen for 'specially.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.919
In this conversation, Anna mentions that it's
expensive to own a horse, so sometimes multiple

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:09.120
people will buy one horse and they'll share
the expenses.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.400
Let's listen to this key sentence again, and
listen for the word especially that has been

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.600
reduced to 'specially.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.270
Anna: My mom co-owned a horse for a little
while.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.550
A lot of people go in on one together so that
you don't have to pay all of the expenses,

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.090
especially with any vet calls that might happen.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.090
My mom co-owned a horse for a little while.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.349
A lot of people go in on one together so that
you don't have to pay all of the expenses,

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.860
especially with any vet calls that might happen.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.760
Vanessa: Did you hear the word especially
or 'specially?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.760
I hope so.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.450
Let me know in the comments, what was your
score?

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.830
Did you get all five of these right, or maybe
you got none of them right.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.680
Feel free to repeat this lesson as much as
you need.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.700
If this listening quiz was a good challenge
for you, then I'm sure that the 30 Day English

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.100
Listening Challenge will help to boost your
listening skills and help you to understand

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.600
native English speakers.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.760
What if you could understand all five of these
conversations 100%, no problem?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.770
That'd be amazing, right?

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:15.890
