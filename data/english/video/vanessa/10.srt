00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from&nbsp;
speakenglishwithvanessa.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.360
Are you hungry? I hope so. Let's talk about it.&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.200
Do you like to cook meals at home nonstop,&nbsp;
then doing the dishes and then preparing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.040
what you're going to make for the next meal&nbsp;
all the time? Probably not. Sometimes it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.760
nice to go to a restaurant, but nowadays&nbsp;
things have changed a bit. Here in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.400
restaurants are slowly starting to&nbsp;
open, but not everyone feels comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.920
going to a restaurant. For me, I have two young&nbsp;
children. So, even without the current situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.520
it's still a little bit complicated to go into&nbsp;
a restaurant. But we don't always want to cook.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.160
Sometimes it's nice to eat restaurant food.&nbsp;
So, what we can do is order food on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.080
pick up the food and take it home to eat.&nbsp;
Or sometimes we take it to a park to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.960
And that is what I would like to do today&nbsp;
with you. I'd like to invite you to join me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.280
as I order food on the phone and pick it up.
This is a very natural daily life situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.960
You are going to hear a fast conversation that I&nbsp;
have on the phone with the woman who's working at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.280
the restaurant. But after each short clip from the&nbsp;
conversation, I'm going to be explaining to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.520
the phrases we used, the different expressions, so&nbsp;
that you can use this as well, because sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.280
talking on the phone is tough. You can't see the&nbsp;
other person, but also there's a lot of background&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.320
noise. Sometimes the restaurant is loud. The&nbsp;
person on the phone is just speaking quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.800
They're not thinking about your perspective.
So, today I want to break down this conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.360
and help you to tackle this seemingly tough&nbsp;
situation. But after this conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.040
I hope it will be more doable and approachable.&nbsp;
We're going to be watching each of the clips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.680
from the conversation, one time, then I'm&nbsp;
going to explain it and then you'll watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.040
it again after my explanation. I hope that the&nbsp;
second time will be more understandable to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.000
Your listening skills will have improved. Your&nbsp;
grammar and vocabulary will have improved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.200
So, put your helmet on, put your seatbelt on. This&nbsp;
is going to be a fast ride, but you can do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.800
All right. Let's get started with my clip.
We just got back from a hike and I'm so hungry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.640
but we really don't have much food in our fridge.&nbsp;
So, we decided to order out and I thought I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.240
invite you to join me in the process of ordering&nbsp;
food out at a restaurant to go pick up. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.360
let's see what happens.
Waitress: Stoney Knob&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.680
Cafe, this is Mackenzie, how can I help you?
Vanessa: Hi, I'd like to make an order for pickup.&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.080
This was a pretty fast start. Wasn't it? Well, in&nbsp;
this first clip, I introduced what I wanted to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.600
very clearly and directly. I said, "I would&nbsp;
like to make an order for pickup." For pickup,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.160
means that I'm going to be the one getting the&nbsp;
food, but we could switch that out and say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.080
"I would like to make a order for delivery."&nbsp;
And that means that, that restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.720
will bring the food to your house. Now, this&nbsp;
is typically, in the U.S., only available for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.640
big restaurants, like chain restaurants,&nbsp;
the restaurant that I'm ordering from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.640
there's only one of them near my house. It's&nbsp;
not an international, or even a national,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.760
or even a citywide restaurant. There's only one&nbsp;
of them. So, they don't have a delivery service.&nbsp;

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.200
So, that's why I said, "for pickup" and I used&nbsp;
the verb "would". "I would like", very polite,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.120
"I would like to make an order for pickup." All&nbsp;
right, we're going to listen to that clip one more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.920
time. I hope that you'll be able to understand a&nbsp;
little bit more. I know it starts off with a bang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.240
but I hope you'll be able to understand a little&nbsp;
bit more. We're going to listen to that first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.360
part of the clip. And then you're going to&nbsp;
watch the second part of the clip as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.760
that I'll explain in just a minute. Let's go.
Waitress: Stoney Knob Cafe, this is Mackenzie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.520
how can I help you?
Vanessa: Hi. I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.480
to make an order for pickup?
Waitress: Yeah, that's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.200
right. What can I get for you?
Vanessa: Yes. I'd like to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.200
the duck spring rolls.
Waitress: All right.&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.840
Vanessa: Also, a big Greek salad.
Waitress: All right.&nbsp;

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.040
Vanessa: You heard, "What can I get for&nbsp;
you?" She said, "What can I get for you?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.840
This is a common restaurant expression when&nbsp;
you're ordering on the phone. She wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.560
know what are you going to order. This is&nbsp;
similar to the phrase. "How can I help you?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.280
But usually we hear, "What can I get for you?"&nbsp;
At a restaurant, and "How can I help you?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.200
In a retail store, where you're going to buy&nbsp;
clothes or buy a phone or something like this.&nbsp;

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.640
Notice that in my answer, I used the word "the",&nbsp;
before my order, this is extremely common in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.960
restaurant. I said, "the duck spring rolls.",&nbsp;
"I'd like to order the duck spring rolls." I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.800
talking about a specific item on the menu. So,&nbsp;
you might say, as you were looking at the menu,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.160
even in a fast food restaurant, you might&nbsp;
say, "Oh, I'd like to order the number five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.240
pork dumplings." Okay. You're talking about&nbsp;
that specific item, the number five. All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.600
Now we're going to listen to that clip one more&nbsp;
time. Listen for "What can I get for you?" And my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.200
answer, "the duck spring rolls." After we listen&nbsp;
to that clip, we're going to immediately listen to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.800
the next clip. So, get ready. Let's listen.
Waitress: Yeah. That's all right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.360
What can I get for you?
Vanessa: Yes. I'd like to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.360
the duck spring rolls.
Waitress: All right.&nbsp;

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.560
Vanessa: Also, a big Greek salad.
Waitress: All right.&nbsp;

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.960
Vanessa: Also, Enter the Dragon.
Waitress: And how did you want that cooked?&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.600
Vanessa: What do you recommend?
Waitress: We recommend medium rare to rare.&nbsp;

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.120
Vanessa: Okay. How about medium rare?
Waitress: Alrighty.&nbsp;

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.080
Vanessa: There is a lot happening in&nbsp;
this short clip, I ordered a tuna dish,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.360
and this dish just has a fancy name, "Enter the&nbsp;
Dragon", on their menu. She asked me an important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.120
question. She said, "How did you want that&nbsp;
cooked?" Notice that she uses the past tense. "How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.160
did you want that cooked?" And you can&nbsp;
use this equally the same amount as, "How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.040
do you want that cooked?" She could have asked&nbsp;
me either question and they both would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.320
equally fine. "How did you want that&nbsp;
cooked?", "How do you want that cooked?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:44.720
Sometimes we use these kinds of flexible tenses&nbsp;
to be more polite in these restaurant situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.600
Unless you are working in a restaurant, maybe you&nbsp;
are, you don't need to worry about the tense. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.640
more important to understand the context and how&nbsp;
to answer, but you might hear people say this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.680
"How did you want that cooked?"&nbsp;
Or "How do you want that cooked?"&nbsp;

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:07.120
She's asking about how done or how cooked I want&nbsp;
my tuna. This is often asked for fish like tuna,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.680
salmon, and sometimes for hamburgers or&nbsp;
steak, which you'll see in just a minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.280
There are different levels of doneness. This is&nbsp;
what we call it, doneness. How much you would like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.560
it cooked. There is rare, which is basically raw,&nbsp;
very red in the middle. Then we have medium rare,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.560
pretty red still. Then we have medium, a little&nbsp;
pink in the middle. Then we have medium well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.560
just a small amount of pink. And then well done&nbsp;
or well, and this is no pink in the middle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.080
this is completely cooked. Usually, this is&nbsp;
not recommended for these types of meats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.120
So, what I like to do is what you just saw. I&nbsp;
like to ask the restaurant what they recommend.&nbsp;

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.680
You're welcome to do this too. This is very&nbsp;
common in a restaurant. I want to know what the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.760
chef or what the restaurant thinks is the best&nbsp;
amount of doneness for the meat. I don't want it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.320
overcooked. I don't want it undercooked. I want&nbsp;
them to make the best decision here. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.760
if you have some special diet needs, then you&nbsp;
can say what you want and it's not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.680
offend the restaurant. If they say, "We recommend&nbsp;
medium." And you say, "Oh, no, no, no, I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.680
want any red. I want it to be well done." That's&nbsp;
fine. They'll do what you want. The customer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.040
always right. But for me, I like to ask what they&nbsp;
recommend. You also heard me say this phrase,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.200
"How about medium rare?". "How about", why&nbsp;
did I say this? Usually, we use "how about"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.760
to give a polite suggestion to other people.
For example, you might say to your friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.040
"How about we go to the beach this afternoon?"&nbsp;
And you're just giving a suggestion. You're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.480
not saying, "We have to go to the beach."&nbsp;
You're just giving a suggestion. Does it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.560
seem a little bit strange that the customer&nbsp;
would give a suggestion to the restaurant?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.080
Because they will do whatever I want. I'm the&nbsp;
customer. This is very normal. Why do I need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.080
give a suggestion? Well, I'm just being polite.&nbsp;
This is a common phrase that we use when we're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.240
these type of restaurant or store situations.
Let's imagine that you're trying on a shirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.000
in a store and you like the shirt, but you don't&nbsp;
exactly like the color. So, the employee comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.240
to you and says, "Can I get that for you in&nbsp;
a different color?" You might say, "Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.960
How about red?" You're suggesting, "I would like&nbsp;
to try this shirt, but in a different color",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.880
you might say, "Yeah. How about red?" Or you&nbsp;
could also say, "Do you have red? I'd like to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.600
red." But we often use this lovely expression, how&nbsp;
about. "How about medium rare?", "How about red?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.280
Great. All right. Let's watch that clip one&nbsp;
more time. I want you to listen carefully for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:00.160
how she asked me about how I want it cooked, how I&nbsp;
answered, how I said, "how about", and then we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.200
going to go on to the next clip where I'm also&nbsp;
going to continue my order. Listen carefully.&nbsp;

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.760
Also, Enter the Dragon.
Waitress:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.040
And how did you want that cooked?
Vanessa: What do you recommend?&nbsp;

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.840
Waitress: We recommend medium rare to rare.
Vanessa: Okay. How about medium rare?&nbsp;

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.040
Waitress: Alrighty.
Vanessa: And finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.080
the Gustavo's Gourmet Hamburger Steak.&nbsp;

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.560
Waitress: All right. Wonderful.&nbsp;
And how would you like that cooked?&nbsp;

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.840
Vanessa: What do you think? You&nbsp;
think medium well is normal for that?&nbsp;

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.560
Waitress: Most people go for medium on that one.
Vanessa: Okay. Let's just do medium then.&nbsp;

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.360
All right. In this clip, I finished ordering&nbsp;
all of the food that I was going to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.520
because I... You'll see later, I have a gift&nbsp;
certificate. So, I decided to order a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.920
food because I wouldn't really need to pay for it.&nbsp;
But did you notice in this clip, if you did not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.560
when we watch it again, please try to notice. I&nbsp;
said, "the", in front of my order, "the Gustavo's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.680
Hamburger Steak". The, because I'm talking&nbsp;
about a specific item on their menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.400
When I asked her about what is normal&nbsp;
for the doneness of the hamburger steak,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.880
she said, "Most people go for medium on that&nbsp;
one." Do you know this phrasal verb, "to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.840
for"? "Most people go for medium on this one."
It is extremely common to use this phrasal verb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.240
in restaurants. When you are ordering something,&nbsp;
you might say, "All right, I'm going to go for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.640
tuna and the steak.", "I'm going to go for the&nbsp;
salad.". "I'm going to go for", this just means to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.360
choose. "I'm going to choose that one." But we use&nbsp;
this phrasal verb a lot when we're ordering in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.400
restaurant. All right, let's watch that clip again&nbsp;
and go on to the next clip. Listen carefully.&nbsp;

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.720
And finally, the Gustavo's&nbsp;
Gourmet Hamburger Steak.&nbsp;

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.680
Waitress: All right. Wonderful.&nbsp;
And how would you like that cooked?&nbsp;

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.160
Vanessa: What do you think? You&nbsp;
think medium well is normal for that?&nbsp;

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.200
Waitress: Most people go for medium on that one.
Vanessa: Okay. Let's just do medium then.&nbsp;

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.040
Waitress: Alrighty. And anything else for you?
Vanessa: That's all.&nbsp;

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.317
Waitress: All right. So, that's the duck spring&nbsp;
rolls. The Greek salad. The tuna, cooked medium&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.317 --> 00:12:13.280
rare. Then the Gustavo, cooked medium?
Vanessa: Yes. That's it.&nbsp;

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.080
Here, she is repeating my order to make sure that&nbsp;
I got everything correct. I think this is a common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.080
practice around the world in restaurants. It seems&nbsp;
like a good idea, right? But I used two phrases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.880
with the word "that", they're slightly different.&nbsp;
So, I want to help you understand them and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.760
use them because we use them all the time,&nbsp;
like a lot of expressions from this video. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.520
when she asks, "Anything else for you?" She's&nbsp;
wanting to know, are you going to order anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.440
else? "Anything else for you?" And I said,&nbsp;
"That's all." That's all, means I'm finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.960
There is no more. This is the end. That's all.&nbsp;
It's not rude to say, it is extremely helpful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.280
in fact, to say, "Anything else I can get&nbsp;
for you.", "Nope. That's all. Thank you."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.440
After she listed all of the things that I&nbsp;
ordered, I said, "That's it." That's it.&nbsp;

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:10.000
"Yes. That's it." How is this different from&nbsp;
"That's all."? Well here, I'm telling her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.480
"You got it, correct. That's it." This is common&nbsp;
in other situations too, not just restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.120
This is very useful for you, as an English&nbsp;
learner. If you're having a conversation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.840
you forget a word, which happens to us&nbsp;
all, even for native English speakers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.920
this happens too, you might be talking&nbsp;
about an experience you had driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:36.000
"I was driving down the street, and then a dog ran&nbsp;
into the road and I didn't want to hit the dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.880
So, I turned my car and I ran into a... What's&nbsp;
that word? The thing on the side of the road,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:51.040
it goes down. Rain is in it sometimes." And your&nbsp;
friend might say, "A ditch, you ran into a ditch."&nbsp;

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.720
And here you can use our key expression. You can&nbsp;
say, "That's it. Yes. I ran into a ditch." You're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.480
letting that person know, with enthusiasm, that&nbsp;
they got it correct. That was the word that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.480
were thinking of. So, here I used "that's it" to&nbsp;
tell her, "You got my order, correct. Yep. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.680
it." Or you can tell your friend, "That's it. You&nbsp;
understood the word that I was trying to say."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.880
All right, let's go back and watch this&nbsp;
clip and then go on to the next clip.&nbsp;

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.320
Waitress: Alrighty. And anything else for you?
Vanessa: That's all.&nbsp;

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.040
Waitress: All right. So, that's the duck spring&nbsp;
rolls. The Greek salad. The tuna, cooked medium&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:34.476
rare. Then the Gustavo, cooked medium?
Vanessa: Yes, that's it.&nbsp;

00:14:34.476 --> 00:14:34.539
Waitress: All right. Perfect.&nbsp;
We'll have this ready for pickup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:36.000
in probably about 15 minutes. Is that okay?
Vanessa: Yes. I have a quick question though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.280
I was given a gift certificate&nbsp;
to Stoney Knob. When I pay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.720
should I just bring that&nbsp;
with me or what should I do?&nbsp;

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:51.360
Because I don't order pickup very often. I wasn't&nbsp;
sure what this restaurant wanted to do. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:57.440
know if they wanted me to pay over the phone,&nbsp;
sometimes they'll ask for your card number over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:03.760
the phone, or if they wanted me to just pay when&nbsp;
I went to the restaurant. So, that's why I asked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.400
and because I had a gift certificate, I wasn't&nbsp;
sure what their process was. So, I simply asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:14.400
them, "What should I do?" And this is good&nbsp;
news for you because maybe there's multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.320
cultural practices that you're not sure&nbsp;
about. It is no problem to ask. I asked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.000
you saw me ask, I didn't know what to do. This&nbsp;
is my home country. I feel familiar with a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.760
of the customs, but there's still things&nbsp;
that I don't know too. And I want to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.920
sure that I'm being polite to that restaurant.
So, I just asked, "What should I do?" And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.440
also... Because it's a gift certificate, I wanted&nbsp;
them to be aware of this, in case there were any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.080
little rules about the gift certificate, sometimes&nbsp;
gift certificates or gift cards have rules like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.840
you need to go into the store to pay, or you&nbsp;
need to spend this much money to use it. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.720
I just wanted them to be aware so that there&nbsp;
were no surprises when I went to pick up my food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.680
All right. Let's watch this clip&nbsp;
and then go on to our next one.&nbsp;

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.560
Waitress: All right. Perfect. We'll have&nbsp;
this ready for pickup in probably about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.840
15 minutes. Is that okay?
Vanessa: Yes. I have a quick question though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.240
I was given a gift certificate to&nbsp;
Stoney Knob. When I pay, should I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.440
just bring that with me or what should I do?
Waitress: Yeah. Just bring it with you and we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.800
be able to... We can just take it from you. You&nbsp;
can either come in to pay with it, or we can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.000
take it from you in the car and do it inside.
Vanessa: Okay.&nbsp;

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.080
Waitress: So, either way, yeah.&nbsp;
But just bring it with you.&nbsp;

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.560
Vanessa: In this clip, she's giving me two&nbsp;
options. One option is, I can go into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:42.480
restaurant and pay for the food when I arrive, or&nbsp;
they will come to my car, take my payment, go in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.360
make the payment and bring it back to me. There&nbsp;
are two options. She uses a lovely expression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:54.400
here. She says, "either way", you can use this&nbsp;
in so many situations in daily life. If you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.080
your friend are going to drive to the beach, and&nbsp;
you're not sure whose car you're going to take,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.360
you might say, "Well, should you drive, or should&nbsp;
I?" And your friend might say, "I don't know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.240
either way is fine with me." Or if your friend&nbsp;
says, "Well, do you want to cook tonight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.400
or do you want to go to a restaurant?" You&nbsp;
might say, "Oh, either way is fine with me."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:20.160
Either way. Both of these are okay with you,&nbsp;
either way. All right, let's go and watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.880
this clip again and then go on to our next one.
Waitress: Yeah. Just bring it with you and we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.160
be able to... We can just take it from you. You&nbsp;
can either come in to pay with it, or we can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.440
take it from you in the car and do it inside.
Vanessa: Okay.&nbsp;

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.840
Waitress: So, either way, yeah.&nbsp;
But just bring it with you.&nbsp;

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.840
Vanessa: Okay. I should just&nbsp;
give you a call when I get there?&nbsp;

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.200
Waitress: Yes, ma'am. That would be great.
Vanessa: I live in the South of the U.S. and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:48.400
quite common to use the term "ma'am", even though&nbsp;
I'm probably not that much older than she is. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.120
not her mother or her grandmother, but it's still&nbsp;
polite in the South to say "ma'am". So, if someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.360
asks me a question, I might say, "Oh, yes, ma'am,&nbsp;
that's right." If I'm talking on the phone to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:06.160
bank, or even if I go into a restaurant, I might&nbsp;
say that or into the bank, this is polite, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:14.480
is not necessary. If you say this in the North&nbsp;
or in the West or in the Midwest of the U.S.,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.200
I don't think this is as common,&nbsp;
but in the South of the U.S.,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.800
when you say "ma'am", this is only for women, just&nbsp;
to let you know, when you say "ma'am", to a woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:31.760
or "yes, sir", to a man, their eyes get all&nbsp;
sparkly and lit up because you're being so polite.&nbsp;

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.720
And in Southern culture, where I live, this&nbsp;
is kind of what children are taught. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:43.520
taught that when you say "Yes, ma'am. Yes,&nbsp;
sir." You're being polite to older people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.560
but even in restaurant situations,&nbsp;
when there's not a big age difference,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.000
this is still a polite situation with a store&nbsp;
and a customer. So, you're going to hear those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.360
expressions if you visit the South of the U.S.&nbsp;
Please don't feel like you need to use, ma'am,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.040
when you're talking with people on a daily basis,&nbsp;
but I just wanted you to know why she said "ma'am"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.840
to me on the phone. All right. Let's watch that&nbsp;
clip one more time and then go on to our next one.&nbsp;

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.320
Okay. I should just give&nbsp;
you a call when I get there?&nbsp;

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.040
Waitress: Yes, ma'am. That would be great.
Vanessa: All right.&nbsp;

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.520
Waitress: And, let me see.&nbsp;
What's the name for your order?&nbsp;

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.600
Vanessa: Vanessa.
Waitress: And a phone number?&nbsp;

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.640
Vanessa: It's (412)...
Did you hear that question she asked?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:32.080
"What's the name for the order?" Why didn't she&nbsp;
ask me, "What's your name?" She wants to know who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.360
can they write on the receipt or on the ticket&nbsp;
so they could deliver it to the right person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.920
in their car. But why didn't she ask me&nbsp;
"What's your name?" She could have said that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.960
and you might hear that sometimes for pickup&nbsp;
orders, but it's a little bit more common to hear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.400
"What's the name for the order?" Because maybe I'm&nbsp;
not going to be the person who picks up the order.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.120
Maybe it's going to be someone else. Maybe I'm&nbsp;
making an order for someone else. For some reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.880
this expression is just more common in restaurant&nbsp;
situations, when you're making an order.&nbsp;

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.560
"What's the name for the order?" It&nbsp;
feels a little more indirect, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:13.280
Not too personal like, "What's your name? I want&nbsp;
be your friend." It's a little more separated. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:19.200
you feel like it's a professional situation.&nbsp;
They're only asking for a business reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.840
not for a personal reason. "What's the name&nbsp;
for the order?" And I just told her my name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.880
Okay. Let's watch that little clip again, and then&nbsp;
we will finish this first conversation in the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.720
clip. All right. Take a deep breath. Let's watch.
Waitress: And, let me see. What's the name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.249
for your order?
Vanessa: Vanessa.&nbsp;

00:20:36.249 --> 00:20:38.800
Waitress: And a phone number?
Vanessa: It's (412)...&nbsp;

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.120
Waitress: All right. And so, if you don't mind,&nbsp;
just give us a call when you pull in. We'll bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.160
it out to you and get the gift card and all that.
Vanessa: Okay. Thank you so much.&nbsp;

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.981
Waitress: No problem. We'll see you then.
Vanessa: Bye.&nbsp;

00:20:49.981 --> 00:20:54.160
Waitress: All right. Bye-bye.
Vanessa: She uses another polite expression here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:01.360
"if you don't mind, just give us a call when you&nbsp;
pull in." This phrase, "If you don't mind." Is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.240
lovely to use in business situations, or&nbsp;
just any time that you want to be polite.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:13.360
You might ask your co-worker, "If you don't mind,&nbsp;
can you send me an email when you're all done?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.640
If you don't mind. Or maybe my husband&nbsp;
already has a long list of things that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.560
going to make at the grocery store, or things&nbsp;
that he's going to buy at the grocery store,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.720
and as he's leaving the door, I might say, "Oh,&nbsp;
wait. If you don't mind, can you pick up another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.160
bag of apples?" This is a little bit... Maybe&nbsp;
a little bit inconvenient for him because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.960
he already has a list, he's about to leave.&nbsp;
So, I just want to use this polite expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:45.520
You don't always need to use it, but there are&nbsp;
many situations when you can, just to be polite.&nbsp;

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:52.240
Did you recognize that she used a phrasal verb at&nbsp;
the end of her question? To pull in. Do you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:59.520
what that means? "Just give us a call when you&nbsp;
pull in." This is talking about my car arriving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.360
to the parking lot. That means that I have arrived&nbsp;
at the restaurant. You might use this phrasal verb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:12.480
to text your friend, or to call your friend, when&nbsp;
you are meeting her at a store, for example. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:20.000
might say, "Hey, I'll be in, in a minute. I just&nbsp;
pulled in." That means that your car just arrived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.240
in the parking lot. This is especially if you're&nbsp;
driving. If you're taking the bus, you might say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:31.520
"Yeah, the bus just pulled in. I'll be there in&nbsp;
just a second." But we use it more often for when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:38.240
we're driving. "I just pulled in. I'll be inside&nbsp;
in a minute." All right. We have successfully made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.560
an order on the phone, but we need to pick it up.&nbsp;
So, there's a couple more clips that I'd like to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.520
show you so that you can successfully pick up&nbsp;
food in English. Let's watch the first clip.&nbsp;

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.840
Hey, so sorry.
Waitress: No, you're fine.&nbsp;

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.680
Vanessa: I was coming to pick up a pickup order.
Waitress: Okay. What was the name?&nbsp;

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.960
Vanessa: Vanessa.
Waitress: Vanessa. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.160
I'll go see if that's ready.
Vanessa: Thank you.&nbsp;

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:06.720
I used the phrase. "I was coming to pick up a&nbsp;
pickup order." You see how I use this as a verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.160
to pick up. And then also as a noun, a&nbsp;
pickup order. It's the same idea here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:19.280
but I used an interesting verb tense. I said, "I&nbsp;
was coming." Do you notice how this is the past?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.520
We saw this earlier as well, that we sometimes&nbsp;
are a little bit more fluid in tenses when we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:34.080
being extra polite, but it is no problem to say,&nbsp;
"I'm picking up a pickup order." In the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.560
tense. "I am picking up an order." Or "I'm&nbsp;
here to pick up a pickup order." No problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.320
There's a couple of different expressions we&nbsp;
can use. And that's just the one that I chose.&nbsp;

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.400
I'm not sure it's the same for your country&nbsp;
nowadays, but in the U.S., we are still required&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:57.680
or suggested to wear a mask in face-to-face&nbsp;
conversations that are close together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:05.040
especially in these kind of public situations like&nbsp;
restaurants and stores, these types of things. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:13.040
for her, she, probably a little bit uncomfortable,&nbsp;
she needs to wear her mask during her whole work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.960
day. But for me, only when I'm interacting with&nbsp;
the customer, is this type of thing... Or with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.360
the employee, is this type of thing necessary. I'm&nbsp;
curious what it's like in your country right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.520
Let me know in the comments, what that's like. All&nbsp;
right. Let's watch that clip one more time. I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.160
you to listen carefully for my wonderful phrase,&nbsp;
and then we're going to watch the next clip.&nbsp;

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.640
Hey, so sorry.
Waitress: No, you're fine.&nbsp;

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.480
Vanessa: I was coming to pick up a pickup order.
Waitress: Okay. What was the name?&nbsp;

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.760
Vanessa: Vanessa.
Waitress: Vanessa. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.960
I'll go see if that's ready.
Vanessa: Thank you.&nbsp;

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.880
Waitress: The total is going to be 65.27.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.600
Okay. I have my... It's a gift certificate&nbsp;
that someone gave me, and my card.&nbsp;

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.280
Waitress: All right. I'll be right back.
Vanessa: Thanks so much.&nbsp;

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.840
Did you notice that she told me the total for&nbsp;
my order, but she didn't use the word "dollar"?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:07.200
She said "That's going to be 65.27." This is a lot&nbsp;
more than I normally spend at a restaurant, maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.760
double the amount that I normally&nbsp;
spend, but I had a gift certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.960
So, I felt like it was okay to splurge a it.&nbsp;
Usually eating out at a local restaurant is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.040
that expensive. At least in my city. If you come&nbsp;
to visit a small town in the U.S., don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:31.120
it's usually not that expensive, but I thought&nbsp;
that it would be a fun time to splurge a bit.&nbsp;

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.760
So, I want you to know that when she was telling&nbsp;
me the amount of money, she didn't say "dollar",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:42.400
she only said the number, 65.27. If you'd&nbsp;
like to practice some big numbers in English,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.840
like hotel numbers, phone numbers, dates,&nbsp;
these types of things. I made a whole video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.200
just specifically for how to say big numbers in&nbsp;
English. It can be a little bit complex. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.440
a lot of different expressions for this. So, you&nbsp;
can check out that lesson up here if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.760
dive deeper into it. All right. Let's watch that&nbsp;
clip one more time and then go onto the next one.&nbsp;

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.840
Waitress: The total is going to be 65.27.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.480
Okay. I have my... it's a gift certificate&nbsp;
that someone gave me, and my card.&nbsp;

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.240
Waitress: All right. I'll be right back.
Vanessa: Thanks so much.&nbsp;

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.440
Waitress: All right, and if&nbsp;
you could sign these for us.&nbsp;

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.920
Vanessa: Yes. Do you guys have a lot of&nbsp;
people come in to do pickup like this?&nbsp;

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.840
Waitress: Yeah.
Vanessa: That's awesome.&nbsp;

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.680
Do you know why I asked her, "Do you have people&nbsp;
coming in for pickup orders like this often?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.040
Why did I ask her that? It's not necessary,&nbsp;
but sometimes I kind of like to have a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.640
small talk at a grocery store or at a restaurant,&nbsp;
because I'm curious about what their experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.720
is like. So, if I'm at the grocery store, I might&nbsp;
ask. "Yeah. Have you guys been really busy today?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:54.080
Or just some kind of question to ask about them.&nbsp;
Maybe it's not appreciated by them. Maybe it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.560
I don't know, but it's just something interesting&nbsp;
for me. But I want to talk about one expression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.920
that we used here so that you can use it too.&nbsp;
She said, "If you could sign these for us."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:10.240
If you could, this is extremely polite. We&nbsp;
often use the full expression. "If you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.880
sign these for us, it would be great."
"It would be great." Is used at the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.600
make sure that you use "would". "It would be&nbsp;
great." This is using a, if, type of sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:30.480
"If you could sign these, that would be great."&nbsp;
But she cut off that end part. It is implied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.520
or understood. I knew what she meant. That's&nbsp;
perfectly fine. It's very normal to do that. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.000
at the beginning, she's asking me to do something.&nbsp;
Do you know what she's asking me to sign?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:48.160
This is the receipt. She's asking me to sign&nbsp;
it because I used my debit card, but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.440
I needed to write a tip on the receipt.&nbsp;
And there's a spot on the receipt. It says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.560
"The total", and then underneath that, there's&nbsp;
a line that says, "Tip", and then beyond that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.080
it says, "Total". So, you have to do a little&nbsp;
math, but usually in the U.S., it is common,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.640
even for pickup orders where there's not&nbsp;
a normal server, to give 20% for a tip.&nbsp;

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.360
So, the easiest way to do this is to take&nbsp;
the first number. So, for in my case, that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:22.960
6 and to double it, which is 12. And because&nbsp;
it was 65, I could add an extra dollar. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:28.480
I could give her a $13 tip, or you can&nbsp;
give more if you want to be extra generous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:36.000
Or if the service is not too good, you can&nbsp;
give less, but 20% is expected. This is a...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.640
Kind of an annoying custom in the U.S. because&nbsp;
all of a sudden your bill gets a lot higher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:50.400
but it is necessary. And it's pretty rude,&nbsp;
extremely rude, if you don't give a tip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:58.000
In fact, for this server, my tip is the only&nbsp;
money that she's going to make. The restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.520
doesn't really pay her. I think they pay her like&nbsp;
$2 an hour. It just covers some basic fees, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.240
doesn't really go to her, kind of, tax money.
But my money, your tip money, is the money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.600
the only salary that the server will make. This&nbsp;
is very different from other countries. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:25.360
keep this in mind, as you are tipping your server.&nbsp;
For me, I've been a server for a part-time job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:31.840
many times in high school and in college.&nbsp;
So, I know that tips are very important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.000
for servers. And if I can be extra generous&nbsp;
for a tip, I always try to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.760
That's just something that's appreciated. So,&nbsp;
I wrote the tip amount. Then I did some math&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:50.720
to see how much it would cost in total, and I&nbsp;
gave it back to her. A quick note about a gift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:57.520
certificate. If you have a gift certificate or&nbsp;
a gift card, for me, my total was $67 and I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:07.200
a $50 gift card, but I gave a 20% tip based on the&nbsp;
total amount, not based on the amount that I paid.&nbsp;

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:16.480
So, I gave a 20% tip from $67. Not from the&nbsp;
amount that I paid. This is important because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:23.680
there's some complicated stuff that goes on in&nbsp;
the restaurant where you should... In the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.720
you should give a 20% tip based on the total&nbsp;
amount. Even if you have a gift card, even if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.720
you have a coupon, gift certificate, any of this,&nbsp;
based on the total amount. All right, let's go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.200
on to our final clip. We're going to watch that&nbsp;
clip one more time, then go on to our final clip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.280
Take a deep breath. Let's watch.
Waitress: All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.600
right, and if you could sign these for us.
Vanessa: Yes. Do you guys have a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.110
come in to do pick up like this?
Waitress: Yeah.&nbsp;

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.960
Vanessa: That's awesome.
Cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.360
And I don't need that back, I&nbsp;
have to give that to you guys.&nbsp;

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.160
Waitress: Yeah. All right. Here you are. Sorry.
Vanessa: Great. Thanks so much.&nbsp;

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.000
Waitress: Thank you.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.400
In this clip, she said, "Here you are." Is she&nbsp;
saying, I am in the car? "Here you are, in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:28.160
car." No, instead, this is common when you hand&nbsp;
someone something from a store, from a restaurant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:34.400
these type of situations. She could also have&nbsp;
said, "Here you go." They both mean exactly the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:43.680
same thing. "Here you go.", "Here you are." If you&nbsp;
go to a store and the cashier gives you a bag that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.600
has your dress, that you just purchased in it, the&nbsp;
cashier might say, "Here you go, have a nice day."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.320
They're just handing you the bag, that's a common&nbsp;
expression for giving someone something. Here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.880
you go. Here you are. All right, let's watch that&nbsp;
clip. One final time. Are you ready? Let's do it.&nbsp;

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.280
And I don't need that back, I&nbsp;
have to give that to you guys.&nbsp;

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.120
Waitress: Yeah. All right. Here you are. Sorry.
Vanessa: Great. Thanks so much.&nbsp;

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.400
Waitress: Thank you.
Vanessa: Thanks so much for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.360
joining me as I ordered food on the phone and&nbsp;
picked it up. I hope that you learned a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.280
useful daily expressions in this lesson. And&nbsp;
now I have a question for you. In the comments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.800
let me know. How often do you eat in a&nbsp;
restaurant? Or you can use the phrasal verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.920
how often do you eat out? Let me know in the&nbsp;
comments and thank you so much for learning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:39.520
English with me. I'll see you again next Friday&nbsp;
for a new lesson here on my YouTube channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:46.400
Bye. And now my family is enjoying our food as&nbsp;
a little picnic on our back deck. It was so nice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:52.960
to not cook, to not clean up dishes, and to just&nbsp;
be able to enjoy this special meal as a family.&nbsp;

00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:00.320
