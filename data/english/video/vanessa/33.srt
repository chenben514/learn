00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.010
Dan: Hello.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.540
Vanessa: Hello, hello.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.060
Welcome to today's live English lesson here
on the Speak English With Vanessa YouTube

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.060
channel.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.750
I'm here with my husband, Dan.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.910
Dan: Hi, everybody.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.970
Vanessa: Today, we're going to be explaining
three important expressions.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.560
One of them is an idiom.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.161
One of them is a phrasal verb, and one of
them is kind of a slang expression, would

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:25.161
you say?

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.050
Dan: Yeah, definitely slang, but good slang.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.420
Vanessa: Yes, slang that you can use in your
daily life.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.730
I hope that these expressions will be useful
to you.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.900
We're going to ask some questions, so make
sure that you interact and try to make your

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.550
own sentences and use them.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.460
That's the easiest and fastest way to remember
is to use it yourself.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.510
Please, answer our questions and participate.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.120
Thank you, everyone, who's here live with
us.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.860
Do you want to say hi to some friends?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.330
Dan: Yeah, we got people from India, I see.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.570
Vanessa: Oh, yes.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.030
Dan: Where else is everybody from?

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.420
I see some Korean.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.560
Vanessa: Vietnam, Algeria, Brazil, Japan,
Mexico.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.630
Dan: All right.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.010
Vanessa: Welcome.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.060
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.060
Dan: Around the world.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.060
Vanessa: Yes.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.130
Thank you for joining us live.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.579

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.689
Today, are you ready to start with the first
expression that we're going to talk about?

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.710
Dan: Yes, I'm ready.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.970
This is kind of like a sneak preview for our
vocabulary lessons.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.119
Vanessa: Yes because every month in the Fearless
Fluency Club, which is my premium paid course,

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.189
we have about 15 to 20 new expressions that
we explain together every month.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.829
These are three of the expressions that are
in the November lesson set, which is coming

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.119
soon in November.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.259
If you join the Fearless Fluency Club now,
you'll get the October lesson set, and then

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.579
November 1st, you'll get the November set,
and learn 17 words, three from today, plus

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.880
14 others.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.979
I hope that you enjoy this lesson and if you
want more, feel free to join us in the month

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:06.979
of November.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:07.979
Dan: Yes.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.500
Vanessa: Are you ready for the first question?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.670
Dan: I'm ready, yes.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.400
We're going to put the vocabulary in a question.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.640
I want to know what are you going to do on
your day off?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.090
Dan: What am I going to do?

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.850
I'm going to make a day of something.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.320
This is our expression.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.320
Vanessa: Yes.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.530
Dan: So, because it's October, I'm going to
make a day of going to the pumpkin patch.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.780
Vanessa: Oh, make a day of something.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.020
This is the expression that Dan used here.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.360
A lovely expression.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360
Dan: Yes.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.470
Vanessa: What does this mean to make a day
of going to, you can see our pumpkins here,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.640
to the pumpkin patch?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.250
Dan: Yeah, so first of all, a pumpkin patch
is a place where you go and pick out a pumpkin,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.730
usually for Halloween.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.730
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.830
Dan: It's a common tradition in America.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.900
Vanessa: Yeah, especially because tonight
we're going to be having a pumpkin carving

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.020
party with our friends, so we had to choose
some pumpkins to carve.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.020
Dan: Yes.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.710
If you make a day of something, this means
that you're going to stretch out the time

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.750
you're doing something.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.720
You could go to the pumpkin patch for ten
minutes and get your pumpkin like that.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720
Dan: Get it really quickly.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.620
Vanessa: That's fine, just buy a pumpkin,
go to the grocery store, not a big deal.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.870
Dan: But, in America, it's very common to
make a day of it.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.870
Vanessa: Yes.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.460
Dan: You go to the pumpkin patch, you look
at all the pumpkins, you take your children,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.280
and they go on a hayride, so they're on a
tractor, and they're riding on the hay.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280
Vanessa: Yes.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.980
Dan: Maybe you drink some apple cider.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.050
You could pick some apples.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.070
Vanessa: Yeah, we also bought some apples,
and played in some of the outdoor games.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.580
This expression, to make a day of it, or to
make a day of something, is an excellent expression

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.980
that you can use.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.790
You can answer this question as well.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.070
What are you going to do this weekend?

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.840
Today is Friday, so what are you going to
do tomorrow?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.270
Are you going to do some activity that you
can do all day?

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.520
Maybe we're going to go for a hike and we
are going to make a day of it.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.190
I want to challenge you to write our question
and also write our sample sentences in the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.870
chat and in the description, or in the comments
so that you can see it.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.479
Vanessa: We're live, unfortunately, I can't
add beautiful words on the screen.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.900
That's one of the negatives about being live,
but there are many positives as well.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.669
I want to know, what are you going to do this
weekend and are you going to make a day of

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.680
it?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.509
I have a quick example, as well that I can
use for this.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:41.610
I recently had a doctor's appointment that
was about 30 minutes away or so.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.270
30 minutes isn't so far to drive, but I don't
often drive.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.360
I'm not a big fan of driving, so when I drove
to the doctor's appointment, I thought, oh,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.080
I'm in a new area, maybe I should make a day
of it.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.590
Vanessa: This doesn't mean that I'm going
to stay at the doctor's office all day.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.430
This means that I'm going to maybe go to a
restaurant for lunch that's close to the doctor's

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.430
office.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.279
I'm going to enjoy that area.

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:12.960
I'm going to take that event, going to the
doctor's office, and I'm going to make more

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960
of it.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.099
I'm going to enjoy a park that's nearby.

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.919
I'm going to enjoy the restaurant.

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.810
Maybe I'll call a friend who lives nearby.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.960
I have a doctor's appointment, but do you
know what?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960
I'm going to make a day of it.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.659
I'm going to enjoy that area and do as much
as I can.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.490
Dan: Yeah, so making a day of something, it
doesn't have to be an extravagant thing.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.699
You could even say, "I'm going to make a day
of watching TV."

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.699
Vanessa: Yes.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.080
Dan: I'm just going to stay home and watch
TV.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.280
I'll make a day of it.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.270
Vanessa: Take a simple activity and just kind
of prolong it a little bit.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.440
I could be going to the doctor's office.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.800
It could be going to the pumpkin patch to
get a pumpkin.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.779
Dan: It could be sitting on the couch and
being lazy.

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:51.779
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:52.779
Dan: Who does that?

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.521
Vanessa: Yeah, or you could just watch TV
all day and make a day of it.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:06:01.129
It's rainy outside, it's cold, I'm going to
make some coffee, maybe eat some unhealthy

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.370
snacks, and just make a day of it.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.159
I'm just going to sit on the couch.

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:09.849
You might have noticed that Dan used this
a lot when he said, "Make a day of it."

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.520
You could say, "I'm going to make a day of
going to the pumpkin patch."

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.569
You could add that activity at the end, but
if you already know the context, I'm going

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:21.009
to watch TV.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.750
I'm going to make a day of it.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.469
We already know that the context is watching
TV.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.499
You could just say, "Make a day of it."

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.930
And it resembles the activity that you're
doing.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.939
I'm going to make a day of it.

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.479
When we went to the pumpkin patch, we certainly
made a day of it.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.479
Dan: We did, yes.

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:38.479
Vanessa: I'd say, yes.

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.870
This is our idiom that we used today.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.389
A lot of you are writing some excellent sentences
here.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.389
Dan: Oh, somebody said, "A couch potato."

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:46.389
Vanessa: Yes.

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:47.389
Dan: That's a good expression.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.650
Vanessa: Yes, I'm going to make a day of studying
in the library.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.099
Beautiful sentence, [inaudible 00:06:51].

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:52.099
This is wonderful.

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.169
You're going to the library.

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:58.559
You're not just going to get a book and go,
you're going to look around, maybe you'll

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:59.830
write while you're there.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.830
Maybe you'll read the book.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.830
Dan: Do some homework.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.039
Vanessa: Do some homework.

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.039
That's excellent.

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:06.400
I'm going to make a day of studying at the
library.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.629
Provine says, "I'm going to make a day learning
English with Vanessa."

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:11.819
All right.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.710
Dan: That's a good day.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.550
Vanessa: So, you're not just watching this
video.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.060
Maybe you're doing to watch it again when
it finishes, you're going to write down these

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.639
expressions, you're going to make your own
sentences, you're going to read them out loud,

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.680
that's what I recommend doing.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680
That's excellent.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.589
Dan: You're doing to watch 100 Speak English
With Vanessa videos in one sitting.

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:29.589
Vanessa: Oh, man.

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:31.340
Can you explain that expression, in one sitting?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.669
Dan: In one sitting, that means you don't
get up.

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:34.850
You don't go to the bathroom.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.310
You don't get a snack.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.370
It's in one sitting.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.629
Vanessa: Yes, in one sitting, you watch ... I
think there's over 300, maybe almost 400 videos

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.779
now on this channel, so you could spend a
lot of time.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:51.840
You could really make a day of learning English
on my YouTube channel, certainly.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840
Dan: Yes.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.830
Vanessa: All right, let's go onto the second
one, which is a phrasal verb.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:02.159
I want to ask you a quick question about helping
someone.

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:08.169
I want to know when was a time that you needed
to talk someone through something.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:10.639
Dan: Our expression is, talk through.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.210
Vanessa: That's the phrasal verb, talk through.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.860
Dan: Or, talk somebody through.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.300
If you say, "I'm going to talk somebody through
something."

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.949
This would mean you're going to explain to
them very thoroughly and help them.

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:24.949
Vanessa: Yes.

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:30.719
Dan: My example is when I worked at a coffee
shop, I used to be a manager at a coffee shop

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:34.870
and I would have to train new people on the
espresso machine.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.919
Anybody here like coffee?

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.250
Vanessa: Not me.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.919
Dan: Like your Americanos your latte's.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.770
Vanessa: Dan's worked in so many coffee shops.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.880
Dan: I have a lot of coffee experience.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.690
Vanessa: I don't like coffee at all, so it's
such a shame.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.690
He gets so much free coffee.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.780
Dan: I drink coffee all the time.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.110
Vanessa: But, I can't benefit from it.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:58.860
Dan: Anyway, I would have to talk to new people
through making espresso.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:06.149
So, learning how to put the espresso in the
machine, how long to steam the milk.

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.320
I would have to show them step by step.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.580
This would be talking somebody through, explaining
it to them.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.180
Vanessa: Yes, yes.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.009
There's actually two expressions that mean
the same thing and they're quite similar,

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:20.730
so I wanted to just share both of them through,
with you.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:27.449
You could say, "Dan talked the new employee
through how to make espresso."

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:31.839
Or, you could say, "He walked them through
the steps."

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.220
Dan: Walked them through.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.680
Vanessa: This means, you are talking something
through the steps, or you're walking them

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.120
through the steps.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.880
This is the exact same thing.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.440
You don't really have to be psychically walking,
but it just means you're explaining step by

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.730
step, you're talking through every step so
that the other person, the new employee can

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.279
understand exactly how to make a good espresso
drink.

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:57.350
Dan: Yeah and you could even use this as a
request.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.070
You could say, "Hey, can you please talk me
through this?"

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.360
Vanessa: That is so polite, yeah.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.550
Dan: It'd be very polite.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:09.910
That means, help me, talk me through, this
is confusing, I need more details.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.420
Maybe you have a math problem in your homework.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.850
I used to ask my dad to talk me through the
problem.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.850
Vanessa: Me too.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.779
Dan: Because it was confusing.

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:19.779
Vanessa: Every night.

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:21.290
Dan: Do you have an example?

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:27.430
Vanessa: Well, I could say, "Often, I get
emails from you all, students, who are learning

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.940
English."

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.910
And maybe, actually the other day I got an
email from a student who couldn't log into

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:40.190
to study their lesson set and this month we're
studying the October lesson set and because

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.259
October is coming to a close, coming to a
close means finishing soon.

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:48.790
Because October is finishing soon, this student
wanted to make sure that they could study

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.670
all the material before November.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.830
You can access all the material forever, but
they wanted to make sure they could access

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.440
it, but they couldn't log in, and they couldn't
find the right website, and couldn't find

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.440
their passwords.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.459
Vanessa: I had to talk them through how to
access the lesson set.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:10.870
In my email I wrote, number one, do this.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.930
Number two, do this.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.170
Number three, do this.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.320
If you have any other questions, feel free
to ask me.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.380
This really helped them step by step understand
how to just access the material.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.610
You could teach someone in that way.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.079
Dan: Yeah, we'd usually use this is something
more detailed.

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:31.150
It's not usually simple things.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.480
Vanessa: Yeah, it's more detailed things.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:39.709
I saw a great sentence here, Sule says, "I'm
going to talk my patients through their problems."

00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:41.529
I'm going to talk my patients through their
problems.

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:45.190
I imagine maybe you're a doctor of some sort.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.190
You have patients.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.190
Dan: Maybe a therapist.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.490
Vanessa: Maybe a therapist and you are explaining
to them step by step.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:57.740
First, we're going to check your heartbeat
and then, we're going to check your pulse,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.080
and then we're going to do this.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.389
You're talking them through each step.

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:06.430
Dan: Or you're explaining after you check
those things, what the problem is.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.149
You have a heart condition and you have 25
days to live.

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:10.860
Vanessa: Oh, I hope that's not the case.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.060
Dan: That was a little too harsh maybe.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.720
Vanessa: Oh, I hope that's the case for you.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.870
Dan: You have 25 years to live.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.870
Congratulations.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.370
Vanessa: Okay, that's a little bit better.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.990
If you're a doctor, this is a great expression
to use.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.100
Let me talk you through the procedure.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.649
Let me talk you through what's going on.

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:29.720
Like Dan said, it's an excellent question
you can ask, if you need to use English at

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.579
your job, or maybe you interact with anyone
who speaks English at work.

00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:39.250
You can say, "Can you talk me through the
new marketing plan?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.579
Can you talk me through what happened at the
meeting because I missed it?"

00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:44.970
Dan: Yes, that'd be very useful.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.709
Vanessa: So useful and it's really polite
and professional.

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:50.540
It's not just saying "Can you tell me what
happened?"

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.540
Dan: Yeah.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.740
Vanessa: Can you talk me through it, please?

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.899
Can you walk me through it?

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:56.480
Dan: It sounds less helpless than, help me,
please?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.900
Dan: That sounds kind of desperate.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.339
Maybe like you can't figure it out yourself
enough and just, please help me?

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:08.890
So yeah, can you please talk me through this.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.470
I saw a couple of other great expressions.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.350
Nigah says, "You're talking us through this
lesson."

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.350
Excellent.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.350
We are.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.350
Yeah.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.350
Vanessa: We are.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.630
Vanessa: We're talking you through this lesson.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:28.529
Sebehat, I hope I said that correctly, said,
"I'll talk through the chemical experiments

00:13:28.529 --> 00:13:30.100
with my students."

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.660
I want to ask you, do you think we can put,
talk through together if we have the person

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.660
at the end?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.879
In the sentence, he said, "I'll talk through
the experiments with my students."

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:42.480
Dan: I think I would understand that.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.170
Vanessa: Yeah, but how would you say that
sentence?

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:50.480
Dan: I'd probably say, "I'm going to talk
my students through ... talk my students through

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.829
the chemical experiments."

00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:55.620
Vanessa: So, the person who you're talking
to needs to go in the middle of that phrasal

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.620
verb.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.220
That's a really good grammar point because
sometimes with phrasal verbs, they don't know,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.220
can I split it up?

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.220
Should I put it together?

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.220
What should I do?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.449
Thank you for writing that and for explaining
it.

00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:05.449
Dan: Right.

00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:08.149
If you say, "I'll talk through the chemical
experiments."

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:11.889
That probably means that you're just, you
know, talking in detail about the specific

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:16.170
experiments, not necessarily helping your
students.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.330
Vanessa: Yeah, you're just explaining it in
general.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.230
Yes, thank you so much for everyone who is
writing wonderful sentences.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:30.060
I'd like to go on to our slag expression of
the day.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.060
It is, mind blown.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.060
Dan: Mind blown.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.160
Vanessa: Yeah, so I want to know when was
a time that you were mind blown.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.120
Dan: This is a very fun expression.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.310
Vanessa: I love it.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.310
Dan: Yeah.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.600
Basically, if you are mind blown, this means
you are just very, very, very amazed.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.639
Vanessa: Yes, incredibly amazed.

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:45.639
Dan: Yeah.

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:49.470
Vanessa: So, your mind is your brain and blown
means exploded.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.040
It's kind of like your brain is exploding
with amazement.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040
Dan: Yes.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.040
Vanessa: Wow.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.040
Dan: It's very vivid.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.040
Vanessa: Yes.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.370
Dan: You could even say, "It's mind-blowing."

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.810
Vanessa: Let's talk about this in an example.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.100
When was a time that you were personally mind
blown?

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.569
Dan: I've only been mind blown a few times,
I'd say.

00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:09.250
Vanessa: You got a high expectation of life.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.250
Dan: Yes.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.160
It has to be something very amazing.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.930
When I was mind blown recently was when my
baby was born.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.740
When Theo was born, I was mind blown because
you know what's coming.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:30.850
The baby is going to be born, but the feeling
you have when you see your baby, and he comes

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.480
out, and it's just there's a baby.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.379
The baby was inside her and now the baby is
here.

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:37.379
It's mind-blowing.

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:38.379
It's amazing.

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:43.529
Vanessa: If you have ever experienced your
child being born, you understand that feeling.

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:45.220
You were mind blown.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.220
Dan was mind blown.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.680
I remember ...
Dan: I shed a tear.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.930
Vanessa: Yes, that precious moment when I
held Theo the first time and I looked at you,

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.740
I was in a tub actually of really hot water.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:04.330
I was in a tub and I was holding Theo, and
I looked over at Dan and Dan was holding my

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.589
arm, and his face was so precious.

00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:09.920
Dan: I don't know what I looked like.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.319
Vanessa: Oh, you were crying, and you were
just amazed.

00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:15.670
I could tell by the look in your eyes that
you were mind blown.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.290
That's something that's really special to
me that I'll never forget.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:28.980
On a maybe less sentimental note, one time
when I was mind blown was last year on August

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.220
21st.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:37.839
In the US, I think it was kind of international
news, there was a full, is it the solar eclipse?

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:38.839
Dan: Yeah.

00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:39.839
Vanessa: Not the lunar.

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:40.839
Dan: It was a solar eclipse.

00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:42.870
Vanessa: Full solar eclipse, total solar eclipse.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.899
We got to see this.

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:49.360
If you have ever seen this, you know exactly
the feeling when you see a full solar eclipse.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.589
This is nothing like a lunar eclipse.

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:52.680
Dan: Yeah.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:58.350
Vanessa: Everything was unlike reality because
all of a sudden, in the middle of the day,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.949
the sun of covered.

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:04.290
You can see just a bright crown of light around
the sun.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.790
It was mind-blowing.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.100
Dan: It's like Twilight.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:13.339
The moon was slowly coming over the sun and
that's mind-blowing because there's the moon

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:14.339
over the sun.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.339
It's crazy.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.339
Vanessa: Yes.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.439
I remember after that happened, it only lasted
for less than a minute, I think.

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:22.350
Dan: Yeah, it was maybe a minute and 45 seconds.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.189
Vanessa: Yeah, about ... it was pretty exact.

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:31.740
I remember after that happened, we went to
the grocery store and I had a difficult time

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.440
looking around and realizing that this is
the same world that we live.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:42.080
This wonderful, amazing, mind-blowing experience
just happened and we're at the grocery store.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.870
Dan: Yeah, now we're living a regular life.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.330
Vanessa: It felt so weird.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.360
I'm curious for you, have you ever been mind
blown?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:54.590
When you have a mind-blowing experience, it's
weird to go back to normal life because you've

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.740
had this thing that happened.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.309
It's weird to see that real life is still
continuing.

00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:00.309
Dan: Yes.

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:04.450
Vanessa: I hope for you if you have the chance
to experience, whether it's your child being

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.280
born, or a full total solar eclipse.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280
Those things are mind-blowing.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.640
Dan: I think people are mind blown every day
by your lessons.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.640
Vanessa: Oh, I see.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.650
Fazel says, "Your lessons are mind-blowing."

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.419
Dan: Mind-blowing, yes.

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:22.210
Actually, this phrase, you can use this in
a kind of hyperbolic way.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.779
Vanessa: Can you explain hyperbolic really
quick?

00:18:24.779 --> 00:18:28.750
Dan: It's not really, really mind-blowing,
but you say it.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.039
Vanessa: Exaggeration maybe.

00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:32.320
Dan: Yeah, you're exaggerating.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.970
If somebody tells you about something fun
they did, you could say, "Wow, that's mind-blowing."

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:42.720
Vanessa: So, maybe just something simple like,
oh, I hiked and I saw a bear.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.080
Okay, it's cool, but it's not, you know, your
child being born.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.590
Dan: Or, if you think like ... if you went
on a hike and you saw the view from the mountain

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.970
and you said, "Man, it was mind-blowing."

00:18:54.970 --> 00:19:00.710
Yeah, it actually might be, but you could
use that to just really let people know it

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:01.710
was really cool.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.710
It was amazing.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.710
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:04.710
You can exaggerate and use this.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.529
I think this is something that people who
speak American English, American's often use

00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:15.680
exaggerations in speech, so it's pretty common
that we might use something like the expression,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.630
mind blown, for something that's a little
bit less exciting, but we enjoy saying that.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.900
Like, oh, it's mind-blowing.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.179
Maybe for you, Nasima here says, "I agree.

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:27.179
Your lessons are mind-blowing."

00:19:27.179 --> 00:19:31.590
Maybe this is a little bit of an exaggeration.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.500
Dan: I don't know.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.500
Pretty mind-blowing.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.409
Vanessa: I'm glad that you enjoy them and
I'm glad that you all enjoy them as well.

00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:44.400
You might say, "Oh, my team ... " I see here,
Guillermo says, "The Toronto Rapture's is

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.650
a mind-blowing team."

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:46.730
Dan: Oh, basketball.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.380
Vanessa: For you, when you watch their skills,
and you watch their ...

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.350
Dan: Donald Trump is mind-blowing.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.700
Vanessa: Oh, maybe you think that he's mind-blowing.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.880
Dan: I think the fact that Donald Trump is
president is mind-blowing.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.490
Like, what is going on in America?

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.150
Vanessa: Shocking, and surprising.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.220
Dan: Mind blowing.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.220
True statement.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.280
Vanessa: So, Ganet here says, "My mind was
blown when I heard something new."

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.059
This is an excellent way to use this expression
and you can use it in different places in

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:17.480
the sentence and I think a lot of you are
using that correctly, so congratulations.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:24.070
If you enjoy learning these types of expressions,
today we talked about to make a day of something.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.480
This lovely idiom.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.470
Talked about talking through something.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:31.490
Today, we talked through these three expressions
with you.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.330
And to be mind blown.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.030
We talked through how to use the expression,
mind blown.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.390
Dan: You don't even have to say sometimes.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.309
You can just go like this and people will
know what you mean.

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:50.220
Vanessa: Do you think someone who is 60 or
50 years old could do that?

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.610
Dan: Oh, well no.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.880
Probably not.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.200
They still might understand you.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.809
Vanessa: Oh, they would understand, but I
think that mainly younger people use only

00:20:58.809 --> 00:20:59.950
the hand movement.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.070
I think anyone can use that expression.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.070
Dan: It's a joke.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.409
It's, you know, it's not common.

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:10.870
Vanessa: But, you might see younger people
just doing this and it means mind blown, like

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.929
whoa, I'm amazed.

00:21:11.929 --> 00:21:12.929
How did that happen?

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:14.150
Dan: Yeah, that's the hand gesture.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.640
Vanessa: Like an explosion in your brain.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.059
If you see younger people do that, that's
what it means.

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:21.629
If you're a younger person, you can do that,
no problem.

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:24.851
If you're an older person, I wouldn't really
recommend it.

00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:26.380
It might be a little bit weird.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.380
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.860
Vanessa: But, you know, it's up to you.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.869
It's your personal choice.

00:21:30.869 --> 00:21:39.260
If you would like to continue to learn English
with us and learn 14 more useful expressions

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.429
like these today, I recommend that you join
us in the Fearless Fluency Club.

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.350
You can join in October.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.419
Now is October 25th.

00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:53.780
Let's imagine, let's say that you decide to
join October 25th, you'll get the October

00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:02.980
lesson set and then in five, six days, you'll
get the November lesson set, which includes,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:08.110
to make a day of it, to talk through, to be
mind blown, the November lesson set.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.929
You'll be able to get two lesson sets within
about one week.

00:22:11.929 --> 00:22:17.140
Vanessa: If you use the coupon code, new,
you can get it for just $5.00.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.080
This is for the first month.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.090
It's a really good deal.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.990
You can get two different lesson sets.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.830
Check out the course, if you like it, you
can continue and get a lesson set every month.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.350
If it's not a good fit for you, no worries.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.350
It was just $5.00.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.940
Dan: Yeah, it only cost $5.00 to be mind blown
day after day.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.590
Vanessa: If you are mind blown, you can stay
in the course.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.340
I'd like to share with you actually, what
we're going to be talking about, some other

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.840
things that we're going to be talking about
in November, so you can get kind of a sneak

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.260
preview of what we're going to do.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.789
I'm going to share my screen with you here.

00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:56.110
You can see that we are here on the November
lesson set page.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:00.730
In November, our topic is actually massage
and relaxation.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.520
I talked with my friend here, you can see
in this quick little video clip.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.540
Vanessa: You can see that I talk with my friend,
Sarah, who is a massage therapist.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.590
She explains about different types of massage
that she does.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:21.990
She works at a really popular kind of famous,
almost, resort in my city.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:27.130
We talk about here different massage techniques,
and we talk about a lot of different expressions

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.300
like you can see here, to be draped.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.700
We talk about this great verb, draping something.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.789
We have a conversation.

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:37.610
Vanessa: What we've been doing today is the
vocabulary lesson.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.429
You can see, well, we have two different parts,
actually.

00:23:41.429 --> 00:23:48.840
You can see that Dan and I, just like today
in this live lesson, explain for about one

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:55.820
hour these 17 different expressions so that
you can learn about how to use them, and study

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:01.340
them yourself, and hopefully feel comfortable
integrating them into your conversations.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.679
You can watch the videos.

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:04.659
You can download them.

00:24:04.659 --> 00:24:06.140
You can download the MP3.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.110
A lot of my students choose to do this so
that they can study on the train, or in the

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:14.990
car, or maybe if they're family doesn't want
to listen to the lessons, they can just listen

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.340
to it on their headphones.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.049
Vanessa: There's a full transcript as well
so that you can catch every expression and

00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:24.120
understand everything that we're talking about.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.350
Every month as well, there is a grammar lesson.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.100
This month in November, we're talking about
something kind of nerdy.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.990
A little bit for those of you who are interested,
quite interested in grammar, we're talking

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.970
about how to use 'a', 'and', and 'the'.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:46.799
In this grammar lesson, I explain in detail
about using 'a', 'and' and 'the', hopefully

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:48.960
in a clear and concise way.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.860
Vanessa: And then, we have the pronunciation
lesson, where you get a chance to shadow,

00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:00.600
and focus on pronouncing exactly like me and
exactly like my friend Sarah, who is a native

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.480
English speaker.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.169
You can enjoy the conversation.

00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:11.890
We also have a story, which is a fun combination
of all of these things that we've learned,

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.930
vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.620
It's a short story, about one page that includes
all of these things together so that you can

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.860
practice them.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.799
I hope that this will be useful so that you
can just repeat the material and study it

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:25.300
as much as you can.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:30.840
Vanessa: All right, thank you, everyone, for
joining us today.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.429
If you would like to join Dan and I in the
Fearless Fluency Club to study about relaxation,

00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:41.270
and massage, and vocabulary, and grammar,
every month there is a new lesson set, so

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:47.630
if you join before November, you'll get October
and November, or if you join in November,

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.110
and then eventually December's lesson set
as well.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.230
I appreciate your time.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.620
Thank you so much for learning with us.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.620
Dan: Thanks, everybody.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.670
Vanessa: Yes and before we go, let's practice
a little pronunciation for one of these expressions.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.960
Let's go back to the first expression, make
a day of it.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.980
We're going to say the sentence a couple of
times slowly, and I want you to repeat it

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.250
with us.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.400
Can you do that?

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.700
It is, I'm gonna, we're going to link together
going to, to make gonna.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:20.029
I'm gonna make a day of learning English.

00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:22.179
I'm gonna make a day of learning English.

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:24.669
Dan: I'm gonna make a day of learning English.

00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:26.500
Vanessa: Yes, so I challenge you to say that
as well.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.510
When you say it out loud, you're using your
pronunciation muscles, but you're also repeating

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.080
that vocabulary expression.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.390
Let's say it together, are you ready?

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.940
I'm gonna make a day of learning English.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.669
Do you want to say it with me?

00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:41.260
I'm gonna make a day of learning English.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.260
Dan: I'm gonna make a day of learning English.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.179
Vanessa: I hope that you can say that out
loud, practice it, and I hope it's true for

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:46.179
you.

00:26:46.179 --> 00:26:47.250
You're going to make a day of learning English.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.020
We talked you through a lot of expressions
today.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.260
Maybe you were mind blown at our explanations.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.010
Thank you, Dan, for joining me.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.010
Dan: You're welcome.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.010
Vanessa: I appreciate it.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.730
I hope that our explanations have been helpful
to you and we'll see you again the next time.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.549
Makes sure that you subscribe so that you
can get notifications anytime there's a new

00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:06.870
lesson and we'll see you the next time.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:07.870
Bye.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.872
Dan: Bye.
