Vanessa: Hi.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.070
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.169
Are you hungry?

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:07.589
Want to come over?

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.650
Let's have lunch.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.650
Want to come over to my house for lunch?

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.060
We're not having anything fancy.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
I'm just going to make some quesadillas Vanessa
style.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.770
Usually we have leftovers for lunch, but today
I thought we'd make quesadillas because I

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.760
have a lot of cheese here, so I hope that
you enjoy it.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.730
I'm going to cook some food first, and then
you're going to join me at lunch with my husband

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.200
and my toddler Theo.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.070
I hope that you'll enjoy it.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.820
Let's talk about some of the ingredients that
I'm going to use.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.360
Of course, we need a tortilla.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240
I'm going to make three of these.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.940
This is just one tortilla.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.290
I'm going to use some butter in the pan.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.250
You can use whatever you want, olive oil,
I don't know.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.800
This is just what I usually use with a quesadilla.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.570
I have some mozzarella cheese, and I have
some kimchi for a very traditional quesadilla.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.570
Just kidding.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.640
This is not traditional at all.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.560
Usually whenever I make a quesadilla, I just
throw in whatever I have in the fridge.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.030
So I already sauteed some kale that you can
see in here and I'm just going to kind of

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.800
push it into the quesadilla.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.220
So first thing's first, got to turn on the
burner, and we'll kind of let that warm up

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.500
a little bit and put my little piece of butter
into the pan.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.600
Stir it up a little bit.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.870
I'm sorry if you come from a country where
quesadillas are your traditional food, this

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.820
is nothing like that.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.070
This is purely Vanessa style.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.950
All right, because I already sauteed the kale,
the pan's a little bit hot, so I'm just going

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.830
to put the tortilla into the pan and mush
it around a little bit.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.750
Now comes the fun part, grating the cheese.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.350
So this is a grater and we use the verb, which
is almost the same thing as the item.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:11.400
I'm going to grate the cheese with a grater,
so I'm just going to do this, and that looks

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.739
pretty good.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.409
And I'll probably just push it around the
pan a little bit because it will evenly melt.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:29.329
If you weren't watching, I would probably
use my hands, but because you're watching

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.459
and this is going to be on the internet, we'll
do it a little bit more of a sanitary way.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.719
During lunch today I plan on playing a game
called ... Or, not really a game, just using

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.980
this item called Table Topics.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.389
It's this little box that has a bunch of questions
in it, and Dan and I often use these questions

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.400
just to talk about stuff during a meal because
sometimes you don't want to think about your

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.099
day or you don't want to just talk about the
same things you usually talk about, so we're

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.060
going to be using these Table Topic questions.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.590
If you think it's a good idea, if you like
it yourself, you're welcome to use the link.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.620
There's a link in the description where you
can buy it yourself.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.299
I just think it's a cool item because it's
got lots of questions in English.

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:25.409
All right, the next thing is to push this
kale into the quesadilla.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.930
Okay, and next I'm going to put some kimchi
on this.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.530
I don't know if you've ever had kimchi, but
whenever I eat it, I feel so refreshed.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.430
Like there's something about it that just
makes me feel cleansed inside.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.040
And we have a lot of kimchi in our fridge.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.569
Maybe a little too much.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.699
Sometimes I go a little kimchi crazy.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:57.989
Whenever I see kimchi at an Asian supermarket,
or here in Asheville we have a Korean food

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.599
truck, it's like a Korean fusion food truck,
but there's a Korean family who run it and

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.629
they sell kimchi.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.709
This is their kimchi.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.239
So whenever we go there, we always buy more
jars of kimchi because we go through it pretty

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.239
fast.

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.340
All right, I'm going to let that sit there
for a second, because usually I like the bottom

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.910
of the quesadilla to get, or the bottom of
the tortilla to get a little bit crispy or

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.690
hard a little bit, so that the inside is nice
and melted and the outside's a little bit

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.340
crispy.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.910
If I had any leftover chicken, I would put
that in here.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.650
Maybe fish, put it in there.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.750
Whatever we have.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.850
Broccoli, put it in there.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.560
It's a very simple way to make a nice lunch,
because I work from home as your English teacher,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.950
I can eat lunch at home, so it's convenient
to cook things like this.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.400
But I know a lot of people eat lunch at the
office or you're not at home when you're eating,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.430
so of course you could make something like
this for dinner if you wanted.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.700
It's a fun way to use your leftovers like
kale or just kimchi that you have sitting

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.700
around.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.220
All right, let's check the bottom of this.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.920
It looks like it could probably be turned
up a little bit.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.660
I'm going to do that.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.850
I don't want to burn the bottom.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.610
I have done that before, one too many times,
but if you kind of carefully turn up the burner,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.180
it's not a big deal.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.180
Okay.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.390
It looks like our patience has paid off.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.970
You can see I put the ingredients only on
half of it because now comes the important

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.590
part, we need to fold it in half.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.890
I'm going to use my fingers a little bit.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:48.680
Fold it in half so it becomes a nice little
shape like that, and I'll just put it right

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.020
on the plate.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.140
All right, that's one.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.790
You want to see what we made?

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.030
Nothing super fancy, just simple lunch.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.650
Now I'm going to make two more, and then I'll
tell Dan and Theo they can come back inside,

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.240
because Theo is always really loud whenever
he plays, so they always go outside whenever

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
I film a video.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.860
So, I'll tell them to come back inside and
we can have some lunch together.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.560
Vanessa: Well, welcome to lunch.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.140
I'm glad you could join us.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.790
We're eating the quesadilla that I just made.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.790
Dan: Yes we are.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.790
Vanessa: How is it?

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.790
Dan: It's very good.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.710
It as kimchi in it.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.710
Vanessa: Yup.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.710
Dan: A kimchi quesadilla.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.710
Vanessa: Yeah, fusion.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.710
Dan: That's special.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.410
Vanessa: Theo, what do you think about the
quesadilla?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.410
Is it good?

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.410
Theo: Yeah.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.410
Vanessa: Good.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.410
What do you like about it?

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.410
Theo: Cheese.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.410
Vanessa: Cheese?

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.660
Dan: He said cheese.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.660
He loves cheese.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.660
Vanessa: Good.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.250
Well today, Theo, I have something special.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.670
We're going to be talking about some questions.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.790
Do you want to talk about some questions with
us?

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.790
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.790
Vanessa: Okay.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.800
This is Table Topics.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.360
It's like a question conversation starter
box.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.490
Dan: Theo wants to ask a question.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.440
Vanessa: Theo, you want to choose a question?

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.440
All right.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440
What's it say?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440
Dan: Can you read it?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.560
Vanessa: Can you read it?

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.639
Dan: What's it say?

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.639
Theo: More!

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.639
Vanessa: You want me to read it?

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:14.639
Okay.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.330
It says, what's your favorite ... Theo, we'll
read some more after we've finished this one.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.600
Why don't you eat your quesadilla?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.290
Dan: Yeah, let's do one at a time.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.790
Vanessa: What's your favorite song to play
in the car?

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.200
Theo: Rock you!

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.620
Dan: Look up-
Vanessa: What did you say?

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.820
Theo: Rock you!

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.030
Vanessa: Rock You?

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.440
Dan: Oh, Theo has a song.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.390
Number one for Theo is We Will Rock You by
Queen.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.170
For me, I like the song I Belong In Your arms
by-

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.240
Vanessa: Chairlift.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.860
Dan: By Chairlift.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.550
And two-
Theo: Barbara Ann

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.520
Dan: He likes Barbara Ann too, by the Beach
Boys.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.020
You like Barbara Ann?

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.020
Can you sing it?

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.020
Theo: Bicycle!

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.419
Vanessa: Oh, and the bicycle?

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:57.880
Dan: Oh, the bicycle song.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.800
Vanessa: There's like a little kid's song
about a bicycle.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.330
Dan: And my second song I like to listen to
in the car is by Kero Kero Bonito and it's

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.440
called Break.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.220
Look up the video, it's cute.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.570
I like cute music sometimes.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.570
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.580
I feel like I don't really have a favorite
song to listen to in the car, but we listen

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.169
to We Will Rock You a lot, because Theo always
requests it.

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:22.780
He sits in the back seat and says ... What
do you say in the back seat?

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.780
Do you remember?

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.060
Dan: Can you sing it, Theo?

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.570
Theo: Rock you!

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.760
Vanessa: We will, we will rock you.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.289
Yeah, he loves that song a lot.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.399
Vanessa: All right, should we go to the next
question?

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:36.620
Dan: Sure.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.319
Let's see if we can make it through all of
them.

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:39.319
Vanessa: All of them?

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.099
Dan: Well, before Theo wants to get up.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:44.070
Vanessa: You want to read it?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.070
Theo: Yeah.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.350
Vanessa: All right.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.629
Dan: All right, what's it say?

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:49.629
Theo: No!

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:50.629
Vanessa: Oh, you don't know how to read yet.

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:51.629
It's okay.

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:52.629
Theo: New one.

00:08:52.629 --> 00:08:53.629
Vanessa: Let's take a new one after we finish
this one.

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:54.629
Dan: Look at this one.

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:55.629
Vanessa: It is ... Excuse me.

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:56.629
Dan: Bless you.

00:08:56.629 --> 00:08:57.629
Vanessa: Which piece of land would you preserve
forever?

00:08:57.629 --> 00:08:58.629
Theo: Ever!

00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:00.749
Vanessa: Excuse me.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:03.430
Vanessa: Yeah, we'll put that back when we
finish it.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.040
We can maybe make a little pile here.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.589
Dan: Which piece of land would I preserve
forever?

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.189
Theo: Barbara Ann.

00:09:09.189 --> 00:09:13.899
Dan: I'm going to go with-
Vanessa: Barbara Ann.

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:17.250
Dan: I'm going to go with Cinque Terre.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.600
Vanessa: Ah, okay.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.050
Dan: Just keep it the same as it is right
now.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:27.309
So it's in Italy, on the coast in the Mediterranean,
and there's five cities.

00:09:27.309 --> 00:09:28.309
Is it five?

00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:29.309
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:30.309
Cinque, five.

00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:31.309
Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:32.309
Vanessa: Cinque Terre.

00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:36.980
Dan: Maybe it's recency bias, because we went
and saw it, but it was so pretty.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.360
I just want to keep it how it is, and I love
the Mediterranean.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.889
Vanessa: I think I would ... My initial reaction
is to say the rain forest, but we just watched

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:55.870
this documentary about the water, like coastal
waters, and it said that kelp forests are

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:02.350
just as valuable as forests with trees, and
how a lot of the coastal waters are being

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.480
over fished.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.800
So, I kind of feel like I would want to preserve
some coastal waters.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.399
It's not really land.

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:12.860
It says land, but I think that's what I would
choose.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.709
Dan: The land goes down into the water.

00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:15.970
Vanessa: Yeah, it's all good.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.290
Dan: Yeah, something coastal.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.290
I agree.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:24.279
I'm changing my answer, because the ocean
can be in trouble if you fish too much, and

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:25.279
many people do.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.279
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:27.380
Theo, what piece of land would you preserve
forever?

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.769
Theo: *Dinosaur noise*
Vanessa: Oh, that.

00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:30.769
Really?

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:31.769
Okay.

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:32.769
Dan: He makes a good point.

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:33.769
Vanessa: A good point.

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:34.769
Vanessa: All right, let's go to the next one.

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:39.560
Theo, I want to know who taught you how to
ride a bike.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.620
Theo: Opa.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.689
Vanessa: Opa.

00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:46.759
That's Dan's dad-
Dan: My dad taught him how to ride a bike.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.189
Vanessa: He doesn't know how to ride a bike
yet.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.230
Dan: But he might.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.460
Vanessa: He sits on the back seat of the bike
with Dan's dad, who we call Opa.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.100
So-
Dan: Theo, do you like riding on the bike?

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.100
Theo: Yeah.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.100
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.100
Dan: He says yeah.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.100
Theo: High five!

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.100
Dan: What?

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.100
Vanessa: Yay.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100
It's lots of fun.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.100
Theo: High five.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.100
Vanessa: High five?

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.100
Dan: You like to high five on the bike?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.100
Yeah.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.100
Vanessa: All right.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.959
Oh yeah, one time when he was riding, Dan
high fived him while he was on the bike.

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:11.959
What about you?

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:14.369
Who taught you how to ride a bike?

00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:16.310
Dan: I mean, I don't remember.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.170
It's probably my dad.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.550
Vanessa: Yeah, probably.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.809
Dan: Probably my dad, yeah.

00:11:20.809 --> 00:11:21.809
I was young.

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:22.809
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:23.809
Dan: I remember having training wheels.

00:11:23.809 --> 00:11:24.809
Vanessa: Oh yeah.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:29.199
Dan: With the little wheels on the side, and
my bike was green.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:30.889
It was leopard print, but it was green.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.300
Vanessa: You remember your bike?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.300
Dan: Yeah, I loved my bike.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.189
Vanessa: But you don't remember who taught
you how to ride it?

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:37.089
Dan: No, I don't remember who taught me.

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:38.089
I was a little boy.

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:40.300
I cared more about the bike itself.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.439
My parents, who's teaching me?

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:44.699
I don't know.

00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:50.009
Vanessa: Theo, who's going to teach you how
to ride a bike?

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.790
Theo: Nana.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.569
Vanessa: Dan's mom.

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:55.569
Dan: His Nana.

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:59.749
Vanessa: Oh, I know that definitely my dad
taught me to ride a bike, because I saw a

00:11:59.749 --> 00:12:00.749
picture.

00:12:00.749 --> 00:12:05.920
I don't really have a memory of it, but apparently
I ran into my parent's bedroom and said, "Today's

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.679
the day I'm going to ride my bike."

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.679
And they were like, "Okay."

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:16.220
And we went to like tennis court I think,
or a basketball court, and there's a picture

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.920
of my dad helping me to ride a bike.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.920
So yeah.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920
Dan: Cool.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.920
We're all sneezing today.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.920
Vanessa: I don't know why.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.920
Maybe it's pollen.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.920
Dan: You get the real life.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.179
Vanessa: Theo, I have a very important question
for you.

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:29.179
Dan: You listening, son?

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:31.249
Vanessa: Are you ready?

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:34.759
What would you miss most about your home if
you moved?

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:36.019
Theo: Oh, more!

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:37.019
Vanessa: More questions?

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:39.829
We'll ask more questions when we finish with
this one.

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:42.279
Dan: Theo, what's your favorite room in the
house?

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:44.139
Theo: We rock you.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:45.949
Vanessa: He's on the “we will” train.

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:46.949
All right.

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:47.949
Dan: He said, "We rock you."

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:49.689
Vanessa: Are you kissing that card?

00:12:49.689 --> 00:12:52.500
Dan: I don't hear him because he doesn't have
a microphone.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.889
Vanessa: Theo, I don't want you to eat this
card though, because it's not tasty.

00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:58.889
Dan: He's reading.

00:12:58.889 --> 00:12:59.889
He says he's reading.

00:12:59.889 --> 00:13:00.889
Vanessa: Oh, you're reading it?

00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:01.889
Dan: Are you reading it?

00:13:01.889 --> 00:13:02.889
Vanessa: Okay.

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:04.339
Eat it and read it sound very similar.

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:08.029
Dan: What does it say?

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:09.509
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:11.730
What about you?

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.600
What would you miss most about your home if
you moved?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.990
Dan: Ironically, we probably are moving soon,
so-

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.990
Vanessa: We definitely are moving soon.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.629
Dan: We're definitely moving soon.

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:25.809
Vanessa: So what would you miss most about
this home when we move?

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:30.670
Dan: I think everything in the new home is
better.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.649
On the inside, everything is better.

00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:40.050
I'll miss this home's location, because we
live right next to three grocery stores and

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.410
we live in a very walkable neighborhood.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.259
Although the new neighborhood we're moving
to is also walkable.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:54.320
It's just different, because we're used to
living in cities and this is kind of like

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.050
living in a city right now, but we're going
to be living more suburban.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.050
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.270
Dan: But we're going to be living more suburban,
which is a little bit sad.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.270
Vanessa: All right.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.270
We'll get another one in just a second.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.270
I need to answer that question first.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.270
Dan: But the house is much better.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.559
Vanessa: Do you want to choose the next one
for us?

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:07.559
Theo: Yeah.

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:08.559
Vanessa: Okay.

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:09.559
Can you choose this card right here?

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:10.559
There you go.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.610
Dan: Well what about you?

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.860
Vanessa: I think Theo is ready for the next
question.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.480
I think-
Dan: Don't eat it.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.170
Vanessa: Theo, I don't want you to eat it.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.360
Yeah, let's put it back.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.360
It's not food.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360
Theo: There.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.529
Dan: Yeah, put it there.

00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:28.239
Vanessa: Oh, you want us to put this here?

00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:29.730
Theo: Yeah.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.209
Open it.

00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:33.980
Vanessa: Let's save that card so we can read
it the next time.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.110
Dan: He said open it.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.899
Vanessa: Oh, you want to open it and put that
card there.

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:37.930
Theo: Over there.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.970
Vanessa: Or there?

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.690
Okay, that's a good spot.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.779
Dan: I hope people can't hear me chewing.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:45.850
Vanessa: That's the worst sound.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.170
You want to put it there?

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.170
Okay.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:57.139
Vanessa: Oh, I think what I'm going to miss
most about this place, I would say the routines

00:14:57.139 --> 00:14:59.500
that we've had in the last four years.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.959
Like going to the same park, walking into
the grocery store.

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:06.239
We walk to the grocery store a lot, maybe
too much.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.610
Dan: The location is very, very good.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.050
Vanessa: Yeah, we know this neighborhood.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.170
We know our neighbors.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:16.220
Dan: It's also kind of fun to live in an apartment,
even though you don't get much privacy.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.910
The flip side is you get to see a lot of people.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.059
Vanessa: All right, we got a little situation
on my hands over here.

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:21.949
Dan: And we have neighbors who can help watch
our cats and stuff.

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:22.949
Vanessa: Theo, we're going to choose one.

00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:23.949
Let's just choose one.

00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:28.459
Vanessa: Do you want to read this one?

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:29.980
That one's a good one for you, Theo.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.110
Oh, but I don't want you to eat it.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.779
Dan: I think he's confused about the purpose
of the cards.

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:36.959
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.949
Theo, are you done with your lunch?

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:39.949
Theo: Yeah.

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:40.949
More.

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:41.949
Vanessa: You're going to eat more?

00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:42.949
Okay, that's a good idea.

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:43.949
Vanessa: All right, next question.

00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:44.949
Dan: Distract him with food.

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:46.149
Vanessa: Next question.

00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:49.319
What did you get into trouble for when you
were young?

00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:50.319
Theo?

00:15:50.319 --> 00:15:53.199
Dan: Theo, what do you get in trouble for?

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.680
Vanessa: Eating paper.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.639
Do you get in trouble?

00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:58.800
Dan: Do you get in trouble?

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.129
Theo: *Noises*
Dan: He doesn't know what trouble is yet.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:03.379
Vanessa: What did you get in trouble for it?

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.259
Dan: When I was young?

00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:09.009
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:11.209
Dan: I don't know.

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:13.839
Probably just fighting with my siblings.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.839
I used to tease my sister a lot.

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:16.920
Vanessa: Yeah?

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.699
Dan: Yeah, that's probably the main thing.

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:24.899
Fighting with my brother or teasing my sister,
because my brother was older and he was bigger,

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:28.410
but sometimes I would come up to him, and
okay, I teased both of them.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.829
I'd tease my brother too, and try to make
him a little angry.

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:38.660
And sometimes I would take my sister's dolls,
and I would take the dolls and I would say,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.970
"I'm going to take it to the bathroom and
give it a swirly."

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.559
Vanessa: Which is putting it in the toilet.

00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:44.559
So mean.

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:45.860
Dan: Putting the head of the doll in the toilet.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.019
I didn't really do it, I just threatened.

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:51.019
Vanessa: Oh, that's so bad.

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:52.680
I think that is the same for me.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.160
Dan: I was a little bit naughty, I guess.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Yeah.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.160
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.170
You think that daddy was naughty when he was
little?

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.889
Dan: Good news for my son.

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:02.309
Vanessa: I know.

00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:11.780
I remember distinctly there was one Mother's
Day or for my mom's birthday, some kind of

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.980
holiday like that, and we asked her, what
do you want us to give you?

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.680
I think I was like six years old, so my sister
was like three or four.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.130
And she said, "All I want is one day when
you girls don't fight."

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.130
Dan: Wow.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.490
I guess everybody fights with their siblings.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.650
Vanessa: That's so bad though.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.320
That means that she must've been so annoyed
every day with us fighting.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320
Yeah.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.590
Dan: I can't really imagine you and your sister
fighting.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.530
Although her sister can be tough sometimes.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.320
Vanessa was a perfect angel, let me tell you.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.270
Vanessa: I don't know about that.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.270
Theo has something important to tell us.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.270
Dan: You know the truth.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.400
Vanessa: He wants to tell us about Barbara
Ann.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.290
Dan: Oh, you want to sing the song?

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.740
Vanessa: Ready?

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.740
Okay.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.540
Now he's not going to sing it.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.610
Dan: He just likes to hear it.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.060
Theo: Bicycle
Vanessa: Ready, set, go?

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.060
Theo: No, he said bicycle.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.060
Vanessa: Oh, bicycle.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.060
Okay.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.500
Well, Theo took out a bunch of these cards,
so I'll just choose one.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.300
All right, let's do this one.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.000
Which historical time period would you most
like to visit?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.990
Dan: I think you answered this one recently.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.490
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.630
Maybe we already did this card.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.630
Dan: Yeah.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.660
It's a good question though.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.960
I think I would say pre-history.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.290
Vanessa: Okay.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.640
Dan: I want to say like cavemen, and like
when they discovered fire.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.041
And how stupid were they or how smart were
they?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.041
I don't know.

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.070
Were they like, "Ugg, make fire," or were
they like, "I believe I have created fire

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.070
today."

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.370
Vanessa: I was going to say something similar.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:19:06.360
I was going to say, I want to go back to see
one of my ancestors who was a hunter gather.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.930
Maybe they sounded like Theo sounds right
now, and just to see what was their daily

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.930
life like.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.550
What was hunting like and gathering like?

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:19.070
And they had to live outside all the time,
and they had to fight wild animals and live

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.820
through thunderstorms and all of that type
of stuff.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.630
Dan: We really want to go back far.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.720
Vanessa: Who did I descend from and what were
our lives like?

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.160
That wasn't that long ago.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.160
15,000 years ago.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.030
Like what was-
Dan: That's just yesterday.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.680
Vanessa: I think agriculture was 10,000 years
ago.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.680
Something like that.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680
Dan: Something like that.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.680
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680
Theo, what about you?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680
What time period do you want to go back?

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.680
Theo: Bowl.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680
Vanessa: Bowl?

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680
Dan: Bowl.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.680
Vanessa: Okay.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.230
You want to go back and see when bowls were
created?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.220
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Vanessa: Okay.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.550
Dan: He wants to see the creation of the first
quesadilla.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.830
Vanessa: Oh really?

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.110
Dan: He wants to see the invention of cheese.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.890
Vanessa: I would not doubt that.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:19:59.890
Dan: Theo loves cheese.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:00.890
Do you love cheese?

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:01.890
Theo: Yeah.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:02.890
Dan: He said, "Yeah."

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:03.890
Vanessa: All right.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.200
I'm surprised that he has been patient sitting
through all of this so far.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200
Vanessa: All right.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.200
Let's do a shallow, simple question.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200
Maybe simple.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.420
If you knew you wouldn't get hurt, would you
rather sky dive or view sharks from an underwater

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.420
cage?

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.420
Theo: All done!

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.420
Vanessa: Oh, I spoke too soon.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.420
Theo, are you all done?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.420
Theo: Meat.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.430
Vanessa: You want to eat some meat?

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.680
All right, meat.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.320
If you're all done, let's go into the other
room and you can wash your hands, and then

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320
take a nap.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.840
Dan: I don't believe I would get-
Theo: Nana.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.300
Vanessa: Do you want to go see Nana?

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.300
Theo: Yeah.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.630
Vanessa: Oh, Nana's coming after you take
a nap.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.630
That's right.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:41.180
All right, well let's take a little pause,
and I'm going to help him take a nap.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.120
Or maybe we'll just let him play in the other
room for a second.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.624
Do you want to go play in the other room for
a sec’?

00:20:44.624 --> 00:20:47.440
Dan: Yeah, let's let them go to the other
room and wrap it up.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440
Wrap it up.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.440
Wrap it up.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.760
Anybody remember that?

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.760
Theo: Bye.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760
Dan: Wait.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760
You want to see ... Come here.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760
Vanessa: Do you want to sit on daddy's lap?

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.760
Dan: Theo, come here.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.790
They can't see you.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.790
Come right here.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.310
You have to be lifted up.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.310
Let me pick you up.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.730
Vanessa: Oh yeah, so if you wouldn't get hurt,
would you like to skydive or see sharks underwater?

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.440
Dan: I feel like seeing sharks under water
isn't even that dangerous.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.880
Vanessa: Oh yeah?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.880
Dan: Yeah.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.540
Vanessa: Theo, if you want them to see your
truck book, you've got to come over here and

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.540
sit on daddy's lap.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.540
Dan: I have to show them.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.540
All right, ready?

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.540
Vanessa: Yeah, they can't see you over there.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.640
Dan: You want to show them your truck book?

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.230
Vanessa: This is Theo's favorite book.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.860
Dan: You going to show them the truck?

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.410
You see the camera up there?

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.370
Show them the truck book.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:30.370
Vanessa: You like that truck?

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:31.370
Dan: You like trucks?

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.370
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.160
Dan: He does love trucks.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.220
Vanessa: You can read that book if you'd like.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.950
Dan: You want to sit here for a minute and
look at the trucks?

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.460
Theo: *Noises*
Vanessa: Okay, that's a good idea.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.460
Dan: Wow.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:47.240
So I guess I would ... Well skydiving would
scare me even if I knew I was going to survive,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.370
so-
Vanessa: You know what?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.970
When I first saw this question a couple seconds
ago, my instinct was sharks.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:53.970
Dan: Really?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:22:00.570
Vanessa: Yeah, because I feel like I would
be ... It's not often that you can go deep

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.700
under the water and see cool things.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.910
Theo: Woooow!

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.270
Vanessa: You like that book?

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.780
Dan: He wants me to point at all the trucks.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.840
Vanessa: This is what happens when you have
dinner or try to have a conversation with

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.840
a toddler.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.210
Dan: Yeah, we're probably going to have to
cut this conversation short.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.210
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.030
Well I think that's a good question to end
on.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.030
Dan: Yeah.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.030
Let's ask Theo.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.450
Theo, would you rather skydive or see sharks?

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.080
Theo: Yeah!

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.720
Dan: Skydive.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.360
Theo: No.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.360
No.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.731
Vanessa: You want to get back here?

00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:31.731
Dan: He wants to come back.

00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:36.040
Vanessa: Well, thank you so much for joining
us for this lunch.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.200
I hope it was an eye opening experience.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.340
If you have had kids, you know exactly what
this is like.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.260
If you have never had kids, it is a joyful
experience.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.280
Vanessa: Do you want to wave goodbye?

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.030
Dan: Look at the camera and say bye bye.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.030
Vanessa: Bye.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.030
See you later.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.030
Dan: Want to Say bye bye into this?

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.030
Say bye bye.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.030
Theo: Bye bye.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.030
Dan: Bye bye.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.030
Vanessa: Bye.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.370
Vanessa: Did you have a good lunch?

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.370
How was your quesadilla?

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:03.650
I hope you enjoyed our little bit silly conversation
and learned something new about English and

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.140
just about life and the world around you.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.740
Vanessa: Let me know in the comments.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.010
What do you usually eat for lunch?

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.010
Let me know.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.290
It'll be interesting to see what people eat
for lunch around the world.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.820
Vanessa: Thanks so much for learning English
with me and I'll see you again next Friday

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.750
for a new lesson here on my YouTube channel.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.750
Bye.
