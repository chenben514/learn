00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
Hi!

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.299
I'm Vanessa, from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.480
Do I speak slowly?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.280
Let's talk about it.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.880
I get a lot of e-mails from students telling
me, "Vanessa, I'm so glad!

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.820
I can understand everything you say.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.050
But then I turn on an English TV show, and
I can't understand anything?

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.310
Does this mean that you're speaking slowly?"

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.750
I wanted to talk about this today because
it's a great question.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.300
I want to make sure that you know exactly
the truth, and find out what's the next step.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.351
First of all, when I'm explaining something,
like today, in these short videos, I want

00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:50.240
to make sure that you can understand everything.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.560
So my pronunciation isn't unnatural.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.560
I'm.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560
Not.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.560
Talking.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.560
Like.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560
This.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.560
Very.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.560
Slowly.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.560
For.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.560
Children.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.920
I'm not talking like that, but I am talking
clearly, and a little bit reduced.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.810
A little bit slower, because I want to make
sure that you can understand everything.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.830
I'm also talking to a camera.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.240
I know that you are watching, but on my side,
I see a camera, so it's a little bit difficult

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.960
to have a natural conversation when someone's
not there.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.070
The reason why I wanted to tell you this,
is because I have a lot of videos on my YouTube

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.130
channel with other English-speakers.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.390
There's videos with people through Skype.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.990
There's videos with people in my house, around
my city ... I think this is a really good

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.920
way to take your English listening to the
next level.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.700
Start with these videos, more slower explanations,
and then watch videos with my voice ... You

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.420
already understand my voice ... plus one other
person.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.520
I'll make sure that in the description and
at the end of this video, I link to some of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.760
those videos so that you can check them out.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.220
Then the next step is to watch a TV show,
or another YouTube video with someone who's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.510
not me.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.850
Someone who you don't completely understand
already.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.040
I think those are good steps, starting with
these explanation videos, then watching a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.209
conversation video that I've had, and then
going to someone else.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.430
That way, you can test your skills and grow
them step-by-step.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.880
Because my goal is to prepare you for the
real world, kind of like a parent who's raising

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.350
a child and the goal is to send them out as
an adult and prepare them for the real world,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.099
my goal for you is so that you can understand
anyone, and really communicate in any situation.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.910
Not just with me.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.270
I think that this three-step plan, start with
these basic videos, then go to conversation

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.500
videos with me, and then go to conversations
with other people who have a completely different

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
style of speaking ... That's going to really
help you.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.260
This is something that I integrate into the
course The Fearless Fluency Club.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.959
Each month, we have a conversation with me
and another English-speaker.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.280
Sometimes two other speakers.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.810
That way, you can hear how this natural conversation
sounds.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.060
It's usually pretty fast, but you already
understand my voice, so it's going to help

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.810
you to increase step-by-step.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.960
Now, I have a question for you.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.790
I want to know, when you study English, do
you mainly focus on English learning materials,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.800
like this kind of video?

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.700
Or do you mainly focus on English TV shows
or movies, some bigger content that's meant

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.320
for native speakers?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.930
I think it's good to start with more basic
content, and then move to those more challenging

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.580
things, but I want to know for you.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.930
What do you mainly enjoy as you're studying
English?

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.970
Let us know in the comments below, and I can't
wait to see what you have to say.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.600
Thanks so much, and I'll see you the next
time.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.760
Bye!

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.449
The next step is to download my free e-book,
Five Steps to Becoming a Confident English

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.449
Speaker.

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.030
