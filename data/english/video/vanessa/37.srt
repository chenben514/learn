00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.770
Hello!

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.770
Hello!

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.380
Welcome to today's live English lesson here
on the Speak English with Vanessa YouTube

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.380
channel.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.750
I'm so glad that you're joining me.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.590
You're taking time out of your busy day to
improve your English.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.730
Today we're gonna be talking about where you
are from.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.400
We're gonna be talking about your country
but also your heritage, and that means where

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.690
your parents and grandparents and great grandparents,
where they came from.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.960
Maybe they immigrated to your country 200
years ago.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.329
So let's talk about that together and I know
that I mentioned earlier that my husband would

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.680
be joining me for this live English conversation,
but our babysitter is not here.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.030
So Dan is watching our baby.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.700
If the babysitter comes, Dan will join me.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.010
But for now, it's me!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.040
So thank you so much for joining me.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.730
I wanna let you know that if you enjoy today's
lesson about heritage and background and family

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.070
and your ancestry, then I recommend joining
me in August 2018 in the fearless fluency

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.719
club because our topic is heritage.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.539
You're gonna be seeing a conversation between
me and my friend Heather about her heritage.

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.950
She has heritage from China, from England,
from Scotland, from the Philippines.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.420
She has heritage from all over, so you're
gonna really get an in depth look at an international

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.420
person.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.340
You're gonna hear a real conversation, so
if you would like to join the fearless fluency

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.009
club and learn more about heritage and improve
your English, you can check out the link in

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.939
the description below this video.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.799
Alright, let's get started talking about heritage
and where you're from.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.999
First of all, let's talk about the basic question.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.509
When someone asks you, "Where are you from?"

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.359
"Where are you from?"

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:57.310
The pronunciation for this question is not
so straight forward.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.880
You might say, "Where are you from?"

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.969
But native speakers will not say this is often.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.940
Instead, we're gonna say "Where.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.950
Where you from?"

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.030
It kind of sounds like where plus 'er'.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.380
So I recommend trying to repeat this pronunciation
with me.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.410
"Where you from?

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.350
Where you from?"

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.380
Where are you from?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.380
Where are you from?

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.410
And you might say "I'm from Nepal.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.410
I'm from Egypt.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.410
I'm from Brazil.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.610
I'm from Morocco.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.610
I'm from Russia."

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.800
Thank you for all of you who are joining me
live.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.231
You're from that country.

00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:42.320
That is the place where you live currently,
maybe you grew up there, you feel like your

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.300
heart belongs in that location.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.600
But, maybe your parents, your grandparents,
your great grandparents were not originally

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.140
from that country.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.730
And at some point, almost everyone's family's
have moved around and immigrated to another

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.730
place.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.730
My family as well.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.710
So today I'd like to share a quick little
story about my family heritage and also show

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.820
you some DNA.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.680
DNA is your scientific, it's the little pieces
inside of you, your chromosomes that really

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.800
show different things about you.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.430
My DNA makes my hair brown.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.150
My DNA makes my eyes brown.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.740
My DNA also shows which countries my ancestors
have come from.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.210
The word ancestors means people from a long
time ago.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.600
So it's not my parents, it's not my grandparents,
it's before that.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.000
If you want to talk about your parents, your
grandparents, you could use the word relatives.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.520
Relatives.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.770
These are usually people who you personally
know, maybe they're currently alive, or you

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.590
just have known them in your life.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.870
They're your relatives.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.459
But, if you wanna talk about 200 years ago,
these are your ancestors.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.880
These are the people who are the foundation
of your family tree.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.270
And the word family tree is something that
we often use to talk about the growth of your

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.270
family.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:22.669
You might talk about your grandma, your grandpa,
your parents, your mom, your dad, you, and

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.999
then maybe if you have kids.

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:25.319
It's adding onto that.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.650
It's creating a family tree.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.669
So today I'd like to share with you a little
story about my heritage.

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:41.060
I want you to guess, first of all, where do
you think my ancestors came from?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.580
I'm from the US.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.610
Right now I live in North Carolina and if
you asked me, "Vanessa, where are you from?"

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.759
I would say I'm from the US.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.360
I'm from the US, the United States.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.129
Or if you are an American and you ask me,
"Where are you from?"

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.349
If I said I'm from the US you would say, "I
know, I know, of course."

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.590
But you might be asking more specifically
which state are you from.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.840
So if someone said to me, "where are you from?",
and they are also from the US, I need to be

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.539
a little more specific, so I would say "I'm
from South Carolina.

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.159
This is where I grew up.

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.120
But I live in North Carolina."

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.029
So if you have moved around a lot in your
life, that might be a complicated question.

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.419
Where are you from?

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.419
But when we talk about heritage, this is my
great grandparents and beyond.

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.240
They are not originally from the US.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.409
My great grandparents, great, great grandparents,
were not Native Americans.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:50.479
They did not live in this North American area
500 years ago.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.020
In fact, they didn't really live here 200
years ago or 300 years ago, they moved here,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.020
they immigrated here recently.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.970
So, some of you have guessed Russia, some
of you guessed Brazil, some of you guessed

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.889
Italy, some of you guessed Mars.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.850
Pretty close.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.080
Some of you guessed in Japan?

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.139
Okay.

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:25.699
Well, actually part of my family, we would
say my father's side of the family, so you

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.080
can use this as well.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.059
My mother's side of the family or my father's
side of the family.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:38.169
Now for my mother's side of the family, it's
a little bit less recent, so the stories about

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:46.939
their immigration is a little bit less close
to me, but on my father's side, on my father's

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:54.249
side, that's the expression here, on my father's
side or on my dad's side, my great grandparents

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:57.449
came from, what do you think?

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:58.550
Italy.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:07.419
So, my great grandma and my great grandpa,
they were from close to the city of Naples.

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:14.029
In the US, or in English, we say Naples, not
Napoli, but it's the same place.

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:19.520
So they came from a farming village near Naples.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:27.490
And my great grandfather, he moved to the
US, he immigrated away from Italy and he went

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:36.389
to the US and he had a wife and then they
had three kids, but this was the turn of the

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.389
century.

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:45.870
This expression "the turn of the century"
means 1900, maybe 1910, around this time.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.900
He moved to the US around then and had a family,
but his wife died.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:57.300
So he had three children, he also had to work,
so he needed someone to help take care of

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.300
his family.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.869
Maybe he was lonely too.

00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:03.430
So, something that doesn't really happen nowadays.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:09.839
In fact, I'd be pretty surprised if this happened
in a western country nowadays, but he wrote

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:19.490
a letter to his mother who lived back in Italy
and he said, "Mom, I need a wife.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.389
I need a mother for my children.

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:28.140
Can you help me find a good woman to help
raise my children and move to the US with

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.140
me?"

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.950
So she needs to be adventurous, she needs
to be responsible, and she needs to be willing

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.340
to move far away from her family.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.630
So, his mom said, "Don't worry son.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.630
I'll do it."

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:45.210
And she found a woman, she told him this is
her height, this is her width, this is her

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.650
weight, you can get a wedding dress for her.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:55.680
So, he got a wedding dress for her, he took
a boat back to Italy and he met her.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:03.530
But, one day while he was there, he looked
out the window of his house and he saw a woman

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.240
walking by and guess what happened?

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:14.330
He fell in love with her, this random woman
who was walking by, and that's my great grandmother.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:20.770
I don't know what happened to the other woman,
but the woman who was walking by the window

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:28.020
in Italy, she was much taller than the previous
woman, so the wedding dress was too short

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.470
and in a lot of their pictures, her wedding
dress is not touching the floor.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.220
It's quite short.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.110
But this was their story of true love and
she was willing to leave her family to go

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:46.890
to the US and to leave her homeland, to immigrate
to the US.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:53.460
And really, this seems like an amazing story,
but almost every family in the US has a similar

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.890
origin story, a story of their heritage.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.620
And when she moved to the US, she had three
children and then he died, so she had six

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.620
children.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.620
It's quite amazing.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.620
She did it.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.620
She survived.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:12.220
Her children survived and their children survived
and their children survived, and that's me.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:21.080
So, this is a pretty typical American immigration
story, especially around the turn of the century.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.440
Turn of the century is that 1900, 1910, around
that time.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:37.750
So, I used to think, I always thought that
my DNA, my chromosomes, were 25 percent Italian,

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:44.380
it's my great grandparents on my father's
side, so I imagined that I was probably 25

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.580
percent Italian.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.950
But, I recently found out the truth.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.220
The truth was a little shocking.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.820
So, you might have heard of a website or a
service called 23 and Me.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:05.400
23 is the number of chromosomes that you have
in your body and Dan, my husband, he bought

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:13.840
this service for me as a present and you spit,
you use some of your saliva, and you send

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:21.100
it to them and they analyze your DNA to try
to figure out where you are really from.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.420
Because maybe my parents were from a certain
location, but what actually got passed down

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.420
to me.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.380
And this phrasal verb, passed down, means
something that you give to someone else.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.390
Maybe it's physically passing down.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:42.070
For example, this cup is not from my grandparents,
but let's imagine that my grandparents loved

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.070
this cup.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.940
Maybe they loved elephants.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:51.910
So they gave it to my parents, they passed
it down to my parents and then my parents

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.260
passed it down to me.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.280
This is physically giving something to the
next generation.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.360
But we can use that for your DNA or your chromosomes
as well and that's exactly how I used this.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.060
There are certain things that were passed
down in my DNA.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.820
So I did this DNA test and I'd like to show
you.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.560
I'm gonna share my screen with you.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.390
I'd like to show you exactly where my DNA
says that I'm from.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:29.420
Of course there's a little bit of uncertainty
here, but it's pretty clear and it's not 25

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.730
percent Italian.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.630
I want you to guess, what is the highest percent?

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.910
Which country is the highest percent of my
DNA?

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.530
What do you think?

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.490
Because I already said it's not Italian, you
can probably guess that, but there are some

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.490
other countries.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.950
In fact, Italian was maybe third or fourth.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.730
So I'd like to know, what's your guess?

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.190
What do you think is the top in my DNA?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:04.220
I'm gonna share my screen here with you and
I'd like to show you the reality.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:19.020
I was also going to show you my husband's
DNA, but unfortunately, I can't.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.590
Okay, I'm gonna show you this.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.990
I can't because he's not here right now, so
I want to make sure that he's here to talk

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.120
about his own DNA.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.630
All right, you can see on the screen it says
Vanessa Prothe, that's me, and then you can

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.910
also see European 98.1 percent.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.350
This is no surprise.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:45.310
I am pretty certain that most of my ancestors
came from Europe.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:50.260
But let's take a look at the highest percent.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.850
It says British and Irish, specifically the
United Kingdom.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:07.040
So here it says that 19.8, so this almost
20 percent, of my DNA is from the UK.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.300
Maybe that's not so surprising.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.000
There were a lot of people from the UK who
moved to the US, but let's take a look at

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the next one.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.420
This is the one that was the most surprising
to me.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:26.330
19.4 percent is French and German, specifically
Germany.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:31.660
Now this was really shocking to me because
I know that Dan, my husband, has most of his

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.100
heritage from Germany.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.810
And when he took this test, it was true.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.720
Most of his DNA came from Germany and it's
a little bit vague because there are a lot

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:49.070
of changing borders within the last 500 years,
but in general, they predict that my ancestors

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.260
lived in Germany within the last 200 years.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.280
But let's take a look at Italy.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.090
Only 11.7 percent.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.650
How interesting.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:06.130
Even though my great grandparents directly
came from Italy and I know that they came

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.940
from Italy, I still only have 11.7 percent
Italian DNA.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.680
And the next one is Polish.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.040
This was also kind of surprising because I
always felt like my Italian heritage was stronger

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.040
than my Polish heritage, but it's pretty close
actually.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.490
Nine point three percent.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.010
So, nine point three percent of my heritage
is from Poland.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.940
And then the next one is the Balkan peninsula.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.030
Now this is just generally this area.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.480
It's quite vague because there's a lot of
movement within the people.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:46.580
So in the past 100 years, 200, 300 years,
a lot of groups have moved around.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:52.190
But, in general, they predicted that three
point four percent of my DNA came from this

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.190
area.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.710
And then we have the Iberian peninsula.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:00.380
This is Spain and Portugal, modern Spain and
Portugal.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.140
And I wanna help you pronounce this word,
peninsula.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.140
Peninsula.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.450
Because it can be kinda tricky.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:16.730
When you say 'penins'- 'pe'- it kind of sounds
like a 'u', 'pe', 'peninsula'.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.060
So you're gonna say that second 'u' in the
same way.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.060
Peninsula.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.060
Peninsula.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.060
Peninsula.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:32.120
So the Iberian peninsula, and then we also
have some broad Scandinavian, maybe two percent.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:43.541
And then down here it says possibly some Western
Asian Turkish, then maybe Iraq or Iran, maybe

00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:45.290
within this area.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.940
It's quite low, but it's possible.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:54.570
And then finally, we have zero point one percent
North African.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:02.630
Oh, this is quite interesting to me because
I never imagined this, but it seems like genetically

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.550
it's pretty true.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.940
So this is a pretty cool website where you
can see all these things.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:14.760
We can see how recently my ancestors came
from these places.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.250
We can see my parents.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.260
We can see the actual chromosomes.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.530
I think it's really interesting to see all
of this, so I hope that was a little bit interesting

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.530
to you.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.460
And I'm curious to you.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:31.059
What would you say when I ask you where are
you from?

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:32.059
Where are you from?

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:38.020
First, you're gonna say the country that you
live in, but I wanna know what's your real

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.690
heritage.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.230
Let me know in the comments.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.140
What's your real heritage?

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.550
And when you ask someone this question, make
sure that your pronunciation is accurate and

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.570
is natural, so I'm gonna help you to pronounce
this question and I want you to be able to

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.570
pronounce it with me.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.570
Are you ready?

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.760
Please try to repeat with me.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.300
What's your heritage?

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.110
So make sure for that first question it's
pretty straightforward.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.870
What's, what's, but then the second word.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:09.870
Your.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.870
Your.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:17.360
Even though it is 'your', y-o-u-r, it's gonna
sound like y-e-r.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.220
Your.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.410
Your heritage.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.860
What's your heritage?

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.880
And that final word.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.050
Heritage.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.210
Heritage.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.380
Heritage.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.809
That final sound, 'g', 'g', 'g', heritage.

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:33.880
What's your heritage?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:40.670
Well, I hope that you can use that question
accurately and ask anyone who you are curious

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.500
about, what's your heritage?

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.010
Maybe even ask your parents.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.200
Maybe they've never told you about their great
grandparents or someone else they know in

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.570
your family who has immigrated from another
place.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:59.260
And I think for me, it's possible that even
though my DNA is only 11 percent Italian,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:07.260
maybe those people who were from Italy, my
great grandparents, maybe their great, great

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:14.910
grandparents came from the Balkan peninsula
or came from Western Asia.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:21.540
Maybe those other parts of my DNA are actually
from them, but their ancestors came from other

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.540
places.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:28.770
You never know because the world is really
a small place and within the last 300, even

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.860
400 years, a lot of movement and immigration
has happened in other places.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.490
So, I wanna know, what's your heritage and
where are you from right now?

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:43.910
Let me know in the comments and I hope that
you enjoyed this quick, spontaneous lesson.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.590
We've talked for about 20 minutes now about
your country, about heritage, and we've talked

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:55.090
about some excellent, useful vocabulary words,
some phrasal verbs, some other expressions.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:00.340
If there are any words that you didn't understand
and you'd like to ask me about, write a question

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.770
in the comments.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:08.150
Try to use these words, look them up yourself,
and I will try my best to help you.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.270

In the fearless fluency club, we're gonna
be focusing on heritage and this general topic

00:20:57.059 --> 00:21:01.880
with conversations with vocabulary, with grammar,
more pronunciation, so I hope that it will

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.480
be really useful to you.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.350
