Vanessa:
Hi. I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.730
Are you ready to hear a real English conversation?
Let's get started.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.480
Vanessa:
Today, I have something super special to share

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.449
with you. I met an interesting woman whose
family runs a salt business. Yes, salt. You're

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.920
going to meet Carla and hear how her family
started the salt business three generations

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.809
ago. You'll also learn some differences and
different types of salt and just some interesting

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.640
insight into something that every human needs,
but we don't often think about. I'm sure that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.399
you also have things that you're passionate
about, so it's a good chance to listen to

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.860
our conversation and try to imitate the way
that we speak.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.949
Vanessa:
Throughout this conversation, you're going

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:58.219
to see subtitles down here. That's going to
show some vocabulary, phrasal verbs, and important

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.750
pronunciation that we're going to talk about
after the conversation lesson, because after

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.550
the conversation lesson with Carla, you're
going to hear a vocabulary lesson between

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.270
my husband Dan and I, where we're going to
explain some important vocabulary expressions

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.450
that you heard in the conversation with Carla.
I hope that you're going to be able to remember

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.430
these expressions a little bit better, because
we're having a natural conversation about

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890
those expressions.
Vanessa:

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.270
Then, you'll have a grammar lesson, where
we focus on some important phrasal verbs that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.790
you heard in the conversation with Carla.
And finally, at the end, we'll have a pronunciation

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.970
lesson where we'll focus on some important
sentences that you heard in the conversation

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.790
and how you can accurately pronounce those
yourself to try to speak as naturally as possible.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.200
Vanessa:
This is a pretty big lesson. There's a lot

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.329
going on. We've got the conversation, vocabulary,
grammar, and pronunciation. So, you can always

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.090
click on CC, which is the subtitles, so that
you can catch every word that we talk about.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.600
If you enjoy this lesson, I hope that you
can join me in the Fearless Fluency Club,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.009
where you'll get a lesson set like this every
month. Today, you're only going to see a little

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.760
bit less than half of one lesson set, but
each month, I send you a new lesson set, a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.760
full one, where you can learn about new topics,
vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and practice

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.070
using those conversation skills yourself.
Vanessa:

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.080
All right, let's go meet Carla. Hi, everyone!
I'm here with Carla, and Carla has a quite

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.720
interesting family business to share with
us. I've got some visual aids as well, but

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.450
I'll let you explain. What do you say you
do, or what would you say your family does?

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.260
How would you describe it?
Carla:

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.940
Sure. I am third generation in a sea salt
family business.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.940
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.170
Carla:
My grandfather, back in the '70s, was the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.310
first to start importing sea salt from out
of the country. He brought it over in suitcases,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.500
and he didn't know how much to charge. He
was like, "I don't know, I'll bag it up, and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.070
give me $5." And that's kind of set the price
for the next 30 years. We just kept it there.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.070
Vanessa:
Really?

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.070
Carla:
Yeah.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.690
Vanessa:
So, he just thought, "Oh, people will buy

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.690
this." That's cool.
Carla:

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.690
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.420
Was he doing that back home, or...
Carla:

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.080
No. He is from Belgium, originally, or he
was. He passed away. But yeah, he was best

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.180
friends with Michio Kushi, who was the person
that brought macrobiotics into the United

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.180
States.
Vanessa:

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.180
Oh, okay.
Carla:

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.370
And Michio told him, "You need to bring sea
salt into this country because there's going

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.750
to be a shortage of minerals at some point,
and they're going to need this." So my grandfather

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.890
traveled all over Europe trying to find the
most clean, most high mineral sea salt he

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.200
could find, which he settled into the coast
of Brittany, France, and this little town

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.330
called GuÃ©rande.
Vanessa:

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Okay.
Carla:

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.800
And they do this ancient harvesting technique
that was originated by Celts.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.200
Vanessa:
Okay. So that's where this originated, the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200
name.
Carla:

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.080
Yeah, they think that it was from the Celts
that originally did it, but then studies have

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.370
shown that it dates back even further with
this harvesting technique in Asia.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.370
Vanessa:
Wow.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.320
Carla:
Which they're always doing something before

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.520
the rest of us.
Vanessa:

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.980
Sure.
Carla:

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.470
So instead of boiling the water, boiling to
evaporate it and using up all the valuable

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.720
wood that they needed for other things back
then, they realize that they needed to create

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.500
these ponds using these clay beds and let
the sun and the wind do the evaporation for

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.450
them. So this started a very sustainable practice
that has lasted hundreds of years, and it's

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.040
still there today.
Vanessa:

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.980
Wow. It's, it's incredible that they had the
thought process to say, "We need to save wood.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.140
Let's use what we've got." Nature, the sun.
Carla:

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.140
Right.
Vanessa:

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.670
To be able to do that, So at this point are
the origins of the salt still in that area?

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.650
Carla:
So we import from all over the world, and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.240
we have found some really fascinating high-tech
ways that they're still sustainably harvesting

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
and producing all different kinds of salts
with different mineral composition.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.620
Vanessa:
So I would love to hear more about that in

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.620
detail.
Carla:

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.620
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.150
I want to show them the salt that you brought.
Carla:

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.150
Sure.
Vanessa:

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.150
Is this available internationally?
Carla:

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.300
It is.
Vanessa:

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.890
Okay. So maybe they've seen this. Is it mainly
in Europe or could be anywhere?

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.310
Carla:
Parts of Europe. We're also in Malaysia, Australia.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.300
We were working on China a few years ago,
but they have a lot of laws around it with

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.920
it having to be iodized. They've lifted that
since, but it's a huge investment to, as you

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.990
can imagine, to tackle that kind of distribution.
And we're still a family-owned company. We've

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.380
never had investors. Everything has been grassroots
grown.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.780
Vanessa:
Wow, that's really amazing. So if you see

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.720
this brand, the Celtic Sea Salt, I'll put
links to all the websites.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720
Carla:
Okay.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.120
Vanessa:
So you can check it out. But if you see that,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.790
that's the company we're talking about, and
this one's the fine ground, regular kind of

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.630
white, what you kind of recognize as salt.
Carla:

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.630
Right.
Vanessa:

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.500
But there's also other ones that you brought.
Carla:

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.230
Right, so the light gray are these in these
grinders, which this is the same salt, but

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.480
they just don't grind that for you for convenience.
They didn't really have that available before

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.760
we kind of started demanding it from our providers,
saying that the Americans really want their

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.170
shakers. They don't do the European way of
grinding or pinching their salt.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.170
Vanessa:
Oh, got you.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.280
Carla:
So we're the ones that brought the fine ground

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.819
here. Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.580
So that is a cultural thing. I guess it depends
on what your family is used to using.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.580
Carla:
Exactly.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.580
Vanessa:
But just shaking it, especially at a restaurant,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.010
that's really common that this is more a European-type
style. Got you.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.010
Carla:
It is.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.980
Vanessa:
It probably has some steam in Asheville, though,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.980
I imagine.
Carla:

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.500
Oh, yeah. Some people, they're like, "Oh,
I like to pinch it, and I like to grind it

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.880
and I like to shake it. So it's a kind of
a funny little question we have at shows and

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880
stuff.
Vanessa:

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.300
How would you like to serve yourself?
Carla:

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.300
Right.
Vanessa:

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.450
So can you tell me a little bit about the
different types of salt? And I am quite ignorant

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.320
about that except for just hearsay that I've
heard. And of course, what you see, different

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.800
colors and whatnot.
Carla:

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.350
Yeah, I mean, salt, I mean it can be an endless
topic. There's so many different kinds, everything

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.700
from mass industrial salt that we use that
you see like in the Morton shaker that has

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.630
been highly processed and things added and
removed and anti-caking agents. For our table

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:30.300
salt, they originally started putting iodine
into the salt to help with a goiter issue

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.010
a long time ago, which it did help, but the
iodine actually caused a discoloration to

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.120
the salt so they had to bleach it.
Vanessa:

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120
Oh, interesting.
Carla:

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.040
The bleaching caused it to be bitter, so they
had to sweeten it. So they added dextrose,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.220
which caused it to be sticky so it wouldn't
shake out of the jar. So they added anti-caking

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.220
agent chemicals.
Vanessa:

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.970
One thing on top of another.
Carla:

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.700
So what we have kind of come to terms with
is we've realized the salt is actually perfect

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.460
in its own way, and yes there is an iodine
deficiency which we created a seaweed seasoning

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.580
to help with that.
Vanessa:

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.580
Oh, interesting.
Carla:

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.061
Because there was a demand people asking for
us to put iodine in our salt. But because

00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:11.630
of all those complications, we were like,
let's leave our salt alone. Keep it in its

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:17.840
whole form that the body knows what to do
with. And then we offered a a seaweed seasoning.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.281
But you'll see all different colors and all
those different colors come from different

00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:27.720
mineral compositions coming from the different
regions. We even have a super white, white

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.010
salt from Hawaii that is super white cause
it comes from 2,000 feet under the surface

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.289
of the water at the base of a volcano.
Vanessa:

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.130
Whoa. How did someone find that?
Carla:

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:46.920
People know us in the industry as we kind
of have figured out ways to launch these amazing

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.040
commodities into the U.S. market, and the
U.S. market's one of the hardest ones to tap

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.040
into.
Vanessa:

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.040
Really?
Carla:

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.330
Yeah, when you're importing from other countries.
Vanessa:

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.330
Okay.
Carla:

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.350
So a lot of people write us letters and send
us samples. We get dozens a month.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.680
Vanessa:
Wow, saying, "Can you please get us the part

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.800
of this?"
Carla:

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.700
Yes. And that was just one that somebody came
to us at a trade show and said, "You've got

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:11.570
to check this salt out." And it's an amazing
salt. It's beautiful, and it's clean, and

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.390
it has a great source of potassium and calcium.
Vanessa:

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.800
Okay. So I'm curious, when you say that it's
great and it's clean, does that affect the

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.840
taste of it?
Carla:

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840
Yes.
Vanessa:

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.080
Because this term of, "Oh, it's salty. It
tastes like salt."

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.080
Carla:
Right.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.080
Vanessa:
Is there a difference?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.061
Carla:
There is, and you'll start to notice, once

00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:32.890
you start to taste different salts side by
side, you'll start to go, "Oh, wow, I can

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.140
taste that this one's a little more bitter.
This one's a little more like has a saline

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:44.020
taste." When you taste oysters, some people
go, it's just slimy. But when you become create

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.830
a palate for it, you go, "Oh, this is more
briny, or this one tastes more fresh." Or

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.170
you start to kind of compare. Same with wine
or beer or cheeses, you just start to understand

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:59.600
different notes. A higher sodium content,
you're going to have more of a bitter taste.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.500
With higher minerals such as magnesium, potassium,
and calcium, you're having a little more mild

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.630
or tastes almost like an ocean flavor.
Vanessa:

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.630
Okay.
Carla:

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.760
And it naturally enhances the flavor of your
food as opposed to just making it salty.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.750
Vanessa:
Oh, got you. So it's really going to work

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.070
with the things that you're putting it on
in a different way. I'm really curious now

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:26.250
after this, to taste this side by side with
what I've got at home and if I have any different

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.630
types at home to see.
Carla:

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.400
And the key with salt tasting is you want
to start off with the highest mineral content

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.430
salt going to the highest sodium salt because
once your taste buds have been triggered in

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.620
their bitter and sodium levels, you can't
taste the difference of the other things.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.860
So you got to kind of work your way up. I
used to host salt parties in California. Yeah.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.890
Vanessa:
Wow! I would love to go to that.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.690
Carla:
Yeah, it was so much fun. We made cocktails

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.690
and...
Vanessa:

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.860
Yeah, what do you do at a salt party?
Carla:

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.900
Yeah, it's a lot of drinks.
Vanessa:

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.950
Okay. You put them on the rim?
Carla:

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.980
On the rim.
Vanessa:

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.980
Okay.
Carla:

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.670
And I did a lot of like things like edamame
with salt on it or fun things where you would

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:13.270
need the salt on it. And then we did a salt
tasting where I would show people how to kind

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.670
of taste the different notes of salt and the
textures.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.720
Vanessa:
The education part of it.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720
Carla:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.940
Vanessa:
Because it's not just like you said, it tastes

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:25.670
salty, but it could actually bring out other
flavor notes in the food.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.670
Carla:
Even the shape of the crystals will cause

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.120
a different kind of, where is it going to
burst in your mouth? How is it going to break

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.950
down in your mouth? Like these crystals are
very coarse, so some people are a little bit,

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.290
you know, they need it to be ground up because
it's strong. Whereas a flake salt, which we

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.790
offer as well, kind of dissipates in your
mouth and it's not as like potent.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.290
Vanessa:
Okay. And that's actually flat flakes of salts.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.290
Carla:
Yeah.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.410
Vanessa:
Okay. I feel like I've seen that in a picture

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:58.310
before, but I've never bought flake salt before.
Do people add that when they're cooking, or

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.530
is that more for...
Carla:

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.530
Garnishing.
Vanessa:

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.390
A garnish to look at the nice shape?
Carla:

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.770
You can, yeah. I mean, cooking is fine with
it, but I mean some people spend a lot of

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:11.800
money on salt , so some salts you only use
for garnishment or finishing the salt.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.800
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.140
Carla:
This is a great cooking salt cause it's got

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.580
the coarse crystals and it dissolves nicely
into liquids and heat.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.580
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.580
Carla:
And it's cheaper. So you don't want to put

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.390
a handful in your pasta water of the flakes
that are so expensive, right.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.640
Vanessa:
Yeah. So would the flavor of, for example,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:38.250
this is fine ground, if I had this in a coarser
version, would it taste different or what

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.130
would the experience be like to compare that?
Carla:

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:46.010
It's actually really interesting because even
though these are the same salts, it's just

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:51.839
this one ground up. This one tastes a little
different. What we have found is part of what

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:58.530
makes the minerals higher and in the salts
that we have offered is the moisture. So when

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:04.911
you grind it and you lose its little crystal
box encapsulation that holds the brine, the

00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:09.880
liquid, you lose a little bit of the minerals.
So you have a higher sodium. So this does

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:15.070
have a slightly higher sodium than the crystals.
So you have a little more of a bitter taste.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.710
Vanessa:
There's something that's moisture inside.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.920
Inside the little crystal itself, it seems
quite scientific.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.930
Carla:
It is. Yeah. We've worked with lots of scientists

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:30.420
and doctors over the years, over 600, actually,
that endorse our salt that have seen the difference

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.839
firsthand with their patients.
Vanessa:

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:36.290
Yeah. Tell me about that health benefits or
the difference in health because there's a

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.630
lot of problems with too much salt nowadays.
Carla:

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.990
Definitely. Yeah. Sodium is something that
is 100% needed in the body, no matter what.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:50.380
We lose it constantly through sweat, tears,
and going to the bathroom. So we have to replenish

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:57.510
it in a way that the body knows how to get
it back in our body in a way that can be assimilated.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:03.750
The body has... it's kind of like a key where
there's a potassium pump in between the cell

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.790
walls, and without that potassium key, the
sodium can't go in between the cell walls

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.700
to replenish itself. So when you have a super
high sodium table salt that you're using,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.440
you're going to have swelling. You're going
to have all these issues because the sodium

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.570
can't get into the cell walls where it needs
to go.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.570
Vanessa:
Oh, interesting.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.550
Carla:
But if you have a salt that, even if it has

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:28.180
similar sodium content but also has potassium,
that potassium pump can actually work, and

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.990
the sodium can go and hydrate the areas that
need to go.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.820
Vanessa:
So having the other minerals with it can help

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.420
the sodium to actually be more beneficial
for your body.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.740
Carla:
Right. Now there are some people with sodium

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.690
sensitivities that obviously we do have salts
for those people as well.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.690
Vanessa:
Really?

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.550
Carla:
Yeah, because that is a thing, too. Everybody's

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:53.200
different just like your body reacts differently
to caffeine or to dairy, you need to listen

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.510
to your own body.
Vanessa:

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.779
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm curious, what salt do you
use at home?

00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:58.779
Carla:
Oh, gosh.

00:14:58.779 --> 00:14:59.990
Vanessa:
I'm sure you have a plethora.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.320
Carla:
I do. My table's covered in salt with all

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:09.730
these different jars, and right now because
I am pregnant I am more on the higher potassium

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.620
because my potassium level was so low.
Vanessa:

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.150
Oh, interesting, okay. So you're using that
to help supplement your baby.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.950
Carla:
Right, right. Yeah.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.220
Vanessa:
When you use it, are you just using a little

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.330
bit, and that's enough to give you potassium?
Because I know when you take a pill, there's

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.150
a big amount of something in there like a
supplement.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.790
Carla:
Yeah. Right. I was still taking a pill because

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.769
I was so low, but I realized, okay, I'm going
to not go with my magnesium, my high sodium

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:38.050
salts. I'm going to go with my potassium ones,
and I'll just pinch it. And your tongue is

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:43.690
a great tester. If something tastes good to
you, and it feels like it's satisfying, that's

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:49.040
usually your body's saying, "I needed this."
There are some cases where it's extreme. If

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.620
you're going to eat a whole chocolate cake
over there, your body probably doesn't need

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.580
all that chocolate cake.
Vanessa:

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.050
You can overindulge, but when you eat something
that's got just enough of the seasoning on

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.140
it, then that could be really helpful.
Carla:

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:10.100
Yeah, and a lot of the doctors, what they
saw was people have this unquenchable salty

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.650
tooth where they can't seem to get enough,
but when they switch them to a high mineral

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:22.740
sodium sea salt ratio, their salty tooth becomes
a little more quenched because their body's

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.150
finally getting the sodium where it needs
to go in their body. It's really fascinating.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.270
I wish there were more studies.
Vanessa:

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.960
So maybe they were lessening the amount of
salt that they were intaking, but they're

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.290
intaking the right type?
Carla:

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:40.380
Right. Yeah. They finally felt that satisfaction.
Yeah, and this is just in people's practices

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.820
where they contacted us and shared these stories,
even in children, they were saying.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.970
Vanessa:
Oh, wow. I'm really curious to test that on

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.980
myself, too, and try and with different things,
and I think people around the world, My students

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.650
can do that as well, especially if there's
something that, like with the U.S., Morton

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.980
salt. It's just the typical salt that you're
probably going to find in a lot of typical

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.980
places.
Carla:

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.980
The American salt, right?
Vanessa:

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.869
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of other countries have
that kind of typical thing, too, but to try

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:12.370
something that's actually been maybe more
studied and has a lot of thought gone into

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.640
it. It'd be interesting to feel that difference
yourself.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.900
Carla:
Yeah, definitely.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.449
Vanessa:
So I'm curious when, because this is your

00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:25.269
family's business, is everyone in your family
involved in Celtic salt? Sea salt?

00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:28.129
Carla:
We have a huge family, so no.

00:17:28.129 --> 00:17:29.129
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:17:29.129 --> 00:17:31.669
Carla:
There's only a handful of us that are still

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:32.669
involved.
Vanessa:

00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:34.509
So you chose, "I'm going to do this."
Carla:

00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:35.509
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:17:35.509 --> 00:17:36.509
Okay.
Carla:

00:17:36.509 --> 00:17:40.389
I went to culinary school, and then it just
kind of seemed to be a nice fit, and yeah,

00:17:40.389 --> 00:17:44.070
it's just been a passion that we've all kind
of shared for years.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.070
Vanessa:
Nice.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.249
Carla:
My sister is a Pilates instructor in New York,

00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:49.820
so she kind of went on her own thing, which
is cool.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.820
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.759
Carla:
I stayed here and just continued the legacy.

00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:55.639
Vanessa:
And that's awesome. So when you were growing

00:17:55.639 --> 00:17:57.919
up, I'm sure that was something that was big
in your family.

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:58.919
Carla:
Yeah.

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:00.759
Vanessa:
Did they also have a table of salt?

00:18:00.759 --> 00:18:03.769
Carla:
Yeah, oh, our whole family is... They're all

00:18:03.769 --> 00:18:04.769
about the salt.
Vanessa:

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:05.769
Sure.
Carla:

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:07.869
They send us pictures. "I'm at this grocery
store. Here it is," or "I'm in this country

00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:09.609
here. Here it is." So that's fun.
Vanessa:

00:18:09.609 --> 00:18:10.710
Oh, that's so cool.
Vanessa:

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.380
How did you enjoy that conversation with Carla?
Was it a little fast, a little tricky? Did

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.460
you understand everything? I hope that it
made you think about something, salt, that

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:26.440
we don't often think about. Next is a vocabulary
lesson. You're going to see my husband Dan

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.119
and I explaining some key expressions that
you heard in that conversation with Carla.

00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:36.539
After our explanations, you're going to see
a clip from the original conversation with

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:41.799
Carla so that you can just remember the original
context and use them yourself. All right,

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:44.359
let's get started with the vocabulary lesson.
Vanessa:

00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:47.739
The first expression that we're going to talk
about today is the word "sustainable."

00:18:47.739 --> 00:18:49.210
Dan:
Ooh, "sustainable."

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.419
Vanessa:
The typical way that we usually use this is

00:18:52.419 --> 00:18:56.830
to talk about the environment, and that's
how Carly used it. She was talking about how

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:03.149
different salt practices are sustainable for
the environment or unsustainable for the environment,

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:07.399
but there are some other ways we can use this
as well. How would you use the word "sustainable"?

00:19:07.399 --> 00:19:11.700
Dan:
Sustainable. Yeah. So I think today, primarily

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:17.249
I do think environmentally, and some people
even just say "sustainability." Like, "We

00:19:17.249 --> 00:19:23.779
have great sustainability in this country,"
or "We're very unsustainable." I think most

00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:28.029
environmentalists say that we're unsustainable
right now. But yeah, there's other ways you

00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:34.710
can use this. You can use it in certain situations
that you don't think can continue. So maybe,

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:40.250
for example, you're in a relationship with
somebody, and you argue all the time. Somebody

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.830
might be talking with you and saying, "Yeah,
I don't think your relationship is sustainable.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.389
I don't think it can keep on going."
Vanessa:

00:19:47.389 --> 00:19:53.809
Yeah, you can't continue at that in that same
way for a long time, at least while still

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:58.890
being happy. It's not possible. And you could
even use this to talk about your English practice.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.729
If you say, "Okay, I'm going to make an English
plan for myself. I'm going to study for five

00:20:03.729 --> 00:20:06.879
hours every day." Do you think that that's
sustainable?

00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:08.039
Dan:
No.

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:11.369
Vanessa:
No, because you have to have a life, too.

00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:16.240
You have to eat and sleep and go to work and
hopefully see some family and friends. It's

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.729
not possible to continue doing that. So you
might say to yourself, "Okay, I need to create

00:20:21.729 --> 00:20:23.879
a sustainable English practice."
Dan:

00:20:23.879 --> 00:20:24.879
Ooh.
Vanessa:

00:20:24.879 --> 00:20:28.500
"What is something that I can continue on
doing into the future?" Maybe it's something

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:34.840
simple like, "Okay, I'm going to listen to
a couple minutes of this vocabulary lesson

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.590
every day while I drive to work." Cool. Okay.
I think that's pretty sustainable. You can

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:45.049
continue doing that without too much stress
to your personal environment. So what we're

00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:48.570
going to do for each of these vocabulary words,
is we're going to also show you a clip from

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.739
the conversation with Carla so that you can
see how it was originally used, which is what

00:20:52.739 --> 00:20:55.109
we're going to do now. Let's watch the clip.
Carla:

00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:59.879
This started a very sustainable practice that
has lasted hundreds of years, and it's still

00:20:59.879 --> 00:21:05.389
there today. This started a very sustainable
practice that has lasted hundreds of years.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:09.409
This started a very sustainable practice that
has lasted hundreds of years.

00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:12.770
Dan:
The next expression is "thought process,"

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:18.859
and this just means a way of thinking or thinking
deeply about something. And I think we usually

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:25.169
say this when you want to maybe question somebody,
either if they did something wrong or if they're

00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:30.649
just doing something well and you want more
details. For example, maybe somebody is like

00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:36.730
a science student, and they solved a problem
that was really difficult. You could ask them,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:41.200
"What was your thought process when you went
into this problem? How did you think about

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.982
it?" And so "process" means that you're going
step by step how you did something. So it's

00:21:45.982 --> 00:21:46.982
something in detail.
Vanessa:

00:21:46.982 --> 00:21:51.169
Yeah, maybe you want to imitate what they
did. What was your thought process so that

00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:53.549
I can imitate that in future experiments?
Dan:

00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:59.109
Right. But on the other hand, if somebody
did something wrong, most people would probably

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:03.429
say, "What were you thinking?" But you could
also say, "What was your thought process here?

00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:04.600
Why did you do that?"
Vanessa:

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.960
Yeah. It's just another way to say, "Huh?
Why in the world did you make this terrible

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.950
decision?" But it's a little more indirect
than "What were you thinking" or "What was

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:21.019
your thought process? Why did you think that
driving the car down the street when it was

00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:25.169
icy was a good idea? What was your thought
process?" And maybe you didn't have a thought

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:29.799
process. Maybe you just did it. You didn't
think about it, but it's maybe someone questioning

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:30.900
your judgment.
Vanessa:

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:36.789
You can also use this to explain or defend
yourself. So a common way to use this is to

00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:45.480
say, "My thought process was..." So let's
see, if I decide to save money, and I want

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:52.049
to save a lot of money. And in the end, maybe
I don't really save that much. But someone

00:22:52.049 --> 00:22:55.649
might ask you, "Why are you trying to save
money?" If I say, "Oh, I can't go out to eat,

00:22:55.649 --> 00:23:00.960
I'm doing other stuff," and I might say, "My
thought process was if I save enough money,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:08.309
then I can replace my car because our car
is getting old or it's breaking down a lot."

00:23:08.309 --> 00:23:13.710
So I'm just kind of explaining why I'm doing
something. Why am I saving money? My thought

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:19.899
process was I'm doing this because I want
to hopefully buy a different car in the future.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:24.440
So you can use it to defend yourself. "Why
are you doing this?" "Oh, my thought process

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.890
was this. Please understand." So you can use
it in both ways as a question or as a defense.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.610
All right, let's watch this so you can see
how it was used.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.139
Vanessa:
It's incredible that they had the thought

00:23:35.139 --> 00:23:40.810
process to say, "We need to save wood. Let's
use what we've got." Nature, the sun. It's

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:46.090
incredible that they had the thought process
to say, "We need to save wood. Let's use what

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.289
we've got." It's incredible that they had
the thought process to say, "We need to save

00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:52.759
wood. Let's use what we've got."
Vanessa:

00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:55.389
The next expression is "to tackle."
Dan:

00:23:55.389 --> 00:23:56.450
Ahh!
Vanessa:

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:03.120
Yeah. Have you ever watched rugby or American
football? The players will just slam into

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.789
each other and kind of like wrestling, push
each other down.

00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:09.350
Dan:
It literally means to grab and throw somebody

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.619
down, but you go down with them.
Vanessa:

00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:17.990
Yeah. So you are tackling someone. This is
the literal definition of "to tackle," but

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.000
is that how Carla used it?
Dan:

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.749
No. So yeah, there's a figurative way that
we use this that is probably more common and

00:24:24.749 --> 00:24:25.749
it's just-
Vanessa:

00:24:25.749 --> 00:24:26.749
Yeah, we use this all the time.
Dan:

00:24:26.749 --> 00:24:32.519
Yeah. It just means to do something that's
really difficult and big, maybe too big, even.

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:35.869
For example, if you say, "I'm going to learn
1,000 words tonight"...

00:24:35.869 --> 00:24:36.869
Vanessa:
Whoa.

00:24:36.869 --> 00:24:39.269
Dan:
...you're probably tackling too much.

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:42.299
Vanessa:
Yeah. If you say, "I'm going to tackle these

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:49.229
verbs" or I'm going to tackle some big problem,"
just like the American football example with

00:24:49.229 --> 00:24:55.330
you're physically taking down a big person,
that's a big task. It's not impossible, but

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.599
it's just a big task. So maybe this year,
at the beginning of the year, you decided

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:06.000
you had a couple goals for yourself. "I'm
going to tackle my fear of public speaking."

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.289
Ooh. So maybe you're going to join a public
speaking organization and just practice public

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:16.950
speaking each month, or you're going to do
something actively to try to overcome some

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.289
difficulty. "Oh, that's a lot to tackle, but
you can do it."

00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:23.519
Dan:
Yeah. It's kind of used as like a confidence

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:29.230
boost. And some people just say, "It's a lot
to tackle, but I think I can do it." Right?

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.139
So you just put it in this one catchphrase.
"It's a lot to tackle."

00:25:33.139 --> 00:25:35.940
Vanessa:
Yeah. "So learning all of these verbs is a

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.610
lot to tackle, but I think I can do it." So
I hope for you that all of the vocabulary

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:46.599
from this lesson, even though it's a lot to
tackle over the whole month, you can do it.

00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:51.170
Study little by little. Keep practicing. You
can tackle it. You can do it. All right, let's

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.289
watch the clip.
Carla:

00:25:52.289 --> 00:25:56.590
They've lifted that sense, but it's a huge
investment, as you can imagine, to tackle

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:02.179
that kind of distribution, and we're still
a family owned company. We've never had investors.

00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:06.830
Everything has been grassroots grown. But
it's a huge investment, as you can imagine,

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:12.909
to tackle that kind of distribution. But it's
a huge investment, as you can imagine to tackle

00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:15.480
that kind of distribution.
Dan:

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.059
The next expression is "on top of," and this
can mean as it literally sounds, you're on

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:27.800
the top of something or at the greatest point.
For example, "I'm on top of the world!" People

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.059
say that figurative, actually. It means that
you're the best person ever if you say, "I'm

00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:34.080
on top of the world" or-
Vanessa:

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.000
You might be on top of Mount Everest, though.
In this case you are literally on top of the

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
world.
Dan:

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.549
Ooh, that's true. But you may also say to
your child, "Don't stand on top of the table.

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:51.359
Right. Don't stand on the top of it. So this
is literal, but we also use this to mean "in

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:57.690
addition to." So "I have a lot of homework
and on top of that, I also..."

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.929
Vanessa:
Have a part-time job.

00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:01.789
Dan:
Yeah. "I also have to work tonight." Right?

00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:06.479
So this plus this. And we would say that if
it's we're already kind of overwhelmed or

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:11.960
we already have something big, then you're
going to say, "I have this on top of this

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960
other thing."
Vanessa:

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:19.139
Yeah. It's usually adding responsibility.
So it can be used in a positive way, like,

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:24.279
"Oh, he's such a great guy. And on top of
that, he's really handsome." You can use it

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:27.749
in that positive way, but I feel like it's
used negatively more often. What do you think?

00:27:27.749 --> 00:27:29.629
Dan:
Yeah, I mean that sounded all right, what

00:27:29.629 --> 00:27:30.629
you said.
Vanessa:

00:27:30.629 --> 00:27:33.309
Yeah. It's natural. But I feel like we tend
to use this in a more negative way.

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:36.741
Dan:
Certainly, if you have a lot going on, that's

00:27:36.741 --> 00:27:41.259
usually the situation. You have a lot going
on, and on top of that you have other things.

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:45.210
Vanessa:
Yes. A lot of stuff going on. What if I said,

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.610
"I was really on top of my game last night"?
Dan:

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:54.489
Yeah. Yeah. You're really on top of your game.
That means that you're playing the best or

00:27:54.489 --> 00:27:59.759
doing the best that you possibly can. You're
on top of your game. You can also just say,

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:01.539
"I'm on top of it."
Vanessa:

00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:02.539
Yes.
Dan:

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:05.621
Meaning that you're on it. You're doing it.
You're doing the best you can.

00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:08.320
Vanessa:
You're staying current. So maybe if your boss

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.009
says, "How's the project going? Is it going
to be done by 4:00 PM today?" You could say,

00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:14.359
"Yep, I'm on top of it."
Dan:

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:18.220
Yeah, and you can kind of picture like literally
standing or sitting on this thing, right.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.419
Vanessa:
You are conquering it.

00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:21.340
Dan:
You are conquering it. You're on top of it.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.230
Vanessa:
Yeah. I think that's a common expression to

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:28.419
say, "Don't worry, I got it. I'm not falling
behind. I'm not procrastinating. I'm on top

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:33.499
of it." And that could even be a personality
trait, too, like "she is always on top of

00:28:33.499 --> 00:28:39.289
it. She always knows what's going on and she
doesn't forget little things." This is kind

00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:45.269
of an A-type personality. She's always on
top of it, and "it" means life.

00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:47.289
Dan:
Yeah, or on top of things.

00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:49.619
Vanessa:
On top of things. Yes, that could be different

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:53.779
things that are going on in her life. Because
we talked about a couple of different ways

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:55.879
to use this like standing on top of...
Dan:

00:28:55.879 --> 00:28:56.879
The world.
Vanessa:

00:28:56.879 --> 00:29:02.109
...a mountain, to be on top of something or
one thing on top of another, kind of building

00:29:02.109 --> 00:29:05.509
this responsibility, I recommend checking
out the lesson guide so that you can just

00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:10.509
visually see each of those sentences. It's
going to help you to remember them, but also

00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:14.869
hopefully be able to use them yourself. That's
the goal. I hope so. All right. Let's watch

00:29:14.869 --> 00:29:19.741
the clips that you can see how I use this
wonderful expression to talk about salt. Let's

00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:20.741
watch.
Carla:

00:29:20.741 --> 00:29:25.809
The bleaching caused it to be bitter, so they
had to sweeten it. So they added dextrous,

00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:29.989
which causes it to be sticky so it wouldn't
shake out of the jar. So they added anti-caking

00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:30.989
agent chemicals.
Vanessa:

00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:35.970
One thing top of another. One thing on top
of another. One thing on top of another.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:39.999
Vanessa:
The next expression is "to come to terms with

00:29:39.999 --> 00:29:44.849
something." There's lot of words in this expression,
but "to come to terms with something" means

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:51.680
you're accepting something that is maybe emotionally
difficult. And I feel like we have to do this

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:58.389
a lot in life. In order to live somewhat satisfied,
you have to come to terms with difficult things

00:29:58.389 --> 00:30:02.929
in your life and then move on. So what is
something for you that you've come to terms

00:30:02.929 --> 00:30:03.929
with and you've lived?
Dan:

00:30:03.929 --> 00:30:05.380
Yes, I have a personal example.
Vanessa:

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.489
Okay.
Dan:

00:30:06.489 --> 00:30:13.080
So some of you might have struggles with body
image. I will say that it wasn't a huge struggle

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:20.049
for me, but in puberty I realized that I'm
a really skinny guy. Right? So that used to

00:30:20.049 --> 00:30:25.789
bother me. I kind of wanted to be bigger and
stronger, but I had to come to terms with

00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:32.539
the fact that I will never be a buff guy.
I will never be very big or strong. I'm just

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:37.470
a skinny guy, and I've come to terms with
that. I came to terms with it a long time

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:43.740
ago. It doesn't bother me anymore. I've embraced
it, one may say. I wear skinny jeans or a

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.879
skinny shirt, and I just say, "Look at me.
I'm a skinny guy and I like it."

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:50.659
Vanessa:
So you have really come to terms with it,

00:30:50.659 --> 00:30:54.529
but this is something that may be for you
and puberty as you're kind of learning about

00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:57.820
yourself and your body's changing, you feel-
Dan:

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.130
I used to hate it.
Vanessa:

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:04.089
Yeah, it's a difficult thing. And then you
realized, "Okay, this is just who I am," especially

00:31:04.089 --> 00:31:08.409
I think this might have been a difficult thing
for you because your brother is twice-

00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:09.409
Dan:
He's huge.

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:12.389
Vanessa:
He's like twice as big as you are. He's like

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:19.830
a big football player kind of guy. So it's
kind of the opposite of your body type. So

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.429
maybe growing up you had to really come to
terms with the fact that you're different

00:31:23.429 --> 00:31:25.690
from your brother and just different kind
of guy.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.519
Dan:
Yeah, it was mostly, probably just thinking

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:33.659
about with the ladies, honestly, like, will
they think I'm just too scrawny? "Scrawny"

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:36.279
is like the really bad word for "skinny."
Vanessa:

00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:39.950
It's not a bad word as in a curse word, but
it just feels really negative.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.950
Dan:
Yeah.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.369
Vanessa:
Did it work out for you with the ladies?

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:44.450
Dan:
It worked out in the end.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.789
Vanessa:
Good. I'm curious, what is something that

00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:51.499
for you, you have needed to come to terms
with? You might have noticed that in Dan's

00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:57.720
sentence, in his example, he said, "Come to
terms with the fact that." So here he is stating

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.830
that "It's a fact. I'm a skinny guy."
Dan:

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:00.830
I can't change it.
Vanessa:

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:05.249
"This is something I can't change." Or you
might say, "I just need to come to terms with

00:32:05.249 --> 00:32:13.519
the fact that my native language of Japanese
is completely different than English. I can't

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:18.029
change that, but I'm still going to try my
best to learn English." So it is a fact that

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:22.239
Japanese and English are way different. We
don't really share any grammar or any vocabulary,

00:32:22.239 --> 00:32:28.859
but your native language is Japanese. You
can't change that. So you could say, "I need

00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:34.779
to come to terms with the fact that English
is a little bit more challenging for me because

00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:39.019
of my native language. But I'm not going to
let it stop me. I'm not going to let it hold

00:32:39.019 --> 00:32:43.889
me back. I'm going to push on." This is something
that's maybe a little difficult, but you are

00:32:43.889 --> 00:32:46.839
going to embrace it and continue on in life.
Dan:

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:47.839
Yes.
Vanessa:

00:32:47.839 --> 00:32:50.899
All right, let's watch the clips. You can
see how this wonderful expression was used.

00:32:50.899 --> 00:32:53.559
Carla:
What we have kind of come to terms with is

00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:58.409
we've realized the salt is actually perfect
in its own way. What have kind of come to

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:03.479
terms with is we've realized the salt is actually
perfect in its own way. What we have kind

00:33:03.479 --> 00:33:07.879
of come to terms with as we've realized the
salt is actually perfect in its own way.

00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:11.659
Dan:
The next expression is "side by side." Hey,

00:33:11.659 --> 00:33:13.570
we're sitting side by side right now.
Vanessa:

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.570
We are.
Dan:

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:19.859
Yeah. So this just means "next to each other."
And so you could use this in a kind of comparative

00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:25.100
way, like Carla said in the conversation.
"So when you try the salts side by side,"

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:31.019
meaning right next to each other, one after
another, then you'll be able to tell a difference.

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:34.099
So this is a little more complex way to use
"side by side."

00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:36.769
Vanessa:
I feel like whenever someone asked me specifically

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:45.169
about a small difference in something, I often
use this expression. "I need to hear them

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:52.909
side by side" or "I need to taste them side
by side." So for example, we watch some Miyazaki

00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:59.989
movies. This is a Japanese animator who makes
some great movies for kids, but also for adults.

00:33:59.989 --> 00:34:04.399
And there are some different English translations
of those movies.

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.859
Dan:
Yeah, it's a couple of versions. There's some

00:34:06.859 --> 00:34:08.190
debate about what's better.
Vanessa:

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:11.450
There's some debate about which one is best.
So we thought, "Oh, maybe we should buy the

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:17.149
DVD of those movies so that we can continue
to watch them instead of trying to find them

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:21.011
online every single time we want to watch
them." And then we thought, "Which version

00:34:21.011 --> 00:34:25.630
should we get? There's different versions
in English. Which one should we get?" And

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:33.030
then I said, "I don't really hear a difference
unless I listen to them side by side. I think

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:37.750
both are great. Both versions and English
are great, but I can't hear the difference

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:42.370
unless I hear them side by side." So this
means directly one after another, the same

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.190
sentence, then the same sentence. Otherwise
it sounds the same.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.800
Dan:
Yeah, and you may even say, "I need a side

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:54.400
by side comparison," so use it as an adjective
like that. But we also use the "side by side"

00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:00.830
maybe as a camaraderie expression. So if you're
together in something, right? "We walked side

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:06.240
by side into the difficult situation." I don't
feel like it's super common anymore.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.630
Vanessa:
You might hear that, though. It kind of means

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.630
that you are together. "We are struggling
with this together."

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.561
Dan:
Right. "We're doing this side by side. We're

00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:13.880
together in this."
Vanessa:

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.910
Yeah. Yeah. You could use it like that, and
it could also just mean as simple as what

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:24.380
Dan said at the very beginning, "We are sitting
side by side on the couch." Okay. Yeah. It's

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.850
something very literal and...
Dan:

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:26.850
That's a fact.
Vanessa:

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.050
...very simple. All right, let's watch the
clips that you can see how we used "side by

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.910
side" to talk about tasting different salts.
Carla:

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.750
Once you start to taste different salts side
by side, you'll start to go, "Oh, wow, I can

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:40.280
taste that. This one's a little more bitter."
Once you start to taste different salts side

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.240
by side, you'll start to go, "Oh, wow, I can
taste that. This one's a little more bitter."

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.260
Once you start to taste different salts side
by side, you'll start to go, "Oh, wow, I can

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.110
taste that this one's a little more bitter."
Vanessa:

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:54.220
The next expression is "to be all about something."
Dan:

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.490
"All about."
Vanessa:

00:35:55.490 --> 00:36:01.160
Yeah, so in the conversation, Carla was saying
that her family is all about salt.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.420
Dan:
Makes sense.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.130
Vanessa:
Yeah. That means that they like, very intensely,

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.130
salt.
Dan:

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.130
Yes.
Vanessa:

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.780
Her family's been involved in the salt business
for a long time, so she can say, "We're all

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.780
about salt."
Dan:

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.060
And they know all about salt. They know almost
everything about it.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.210
Vanessa:
Yeah. Yeah. So they are deeply involved in

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:23.050
that. They like it a lot. "We're all about
salt." If you like something a lot, maybe

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.830
if you like English a lot, you can say, "Yeah,
I'm all about English. Every moment of every

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:32.010
day, that's what I think about. I'm all about
English." But it could also be to talk about

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:37.900
a main reason for something. So how would
you use this if you were going to use it to

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.890
talk about a main reason?
Dan:

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:40.890
The main reason?
Vanessa:

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.890
Yeah.
Dan:

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.660
What comes to mind for me, obviously, is hockey.
Vanessa:

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.660
Okay.
Dan:

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:51.860
Because I love hockey. So "hockey is all about
skating" or "being good at hockey is all about

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:57.130
skating. Can you skate well?" So this is the
primary factor. The thing you need to know

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:02.400
more than anything else or the thing you need
to be able to do more than anything else.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.400
So you could say, "Yeah, being good at hockey
is all about skating."

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.640
Vanessa:
I would say the same thing about starting

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.000
a business. Starting a business-
Dan:

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
It's all about skating?
Vanessa:

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.960
It's not all about skating. That would be
pretty fun, though. Maybe a hockey business.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:20.660
But starting a business is all about dedication.
If you are willing to dedicate your time and

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.910
your energy, then you're probably going to
succeed.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.120
Dan:
It's all about diligence.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.670
Vanessa:
Yeah, it's a really important factor, is diligence

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:33.460
and dedication. So starting a business is
all about dedication. Yes, you need good ideas.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.720
You need to be probably good at what you're
doing, but if you're not dedicated, it's not

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.720
going to work.
Dan:

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.980
Yeah, and this is an exaggeration, so it's
not literally all about this. You need to

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.210
know other things, too. But if you really
want to emphasize the most important thing,

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.490
then you'll say "all about."
Vanessa:

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:53.100
Yes, "it is all about dedication. It is all
about skating." Or you could just say, "I'm

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.600
all about English," and it means that you
like English a lot.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.240
Dan:
Yeah. You always... You love it. You want

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.810
to study all the time. Yeah, that's probably
you, right?

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.470
Vanessa:
Yeah. I hope so. All right. Let's watch the

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.860
clip so that you could see how this was used.
Carla:

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.690
Our whole family is... They're all about the
salt.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.690
Vanessa:
Sure.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.400
Carla:
They send us pictures. "I'm at this grocery

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.800
store. Here it is," or "I'm in this country.
Here it is," so it's fun.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800
Vanessa:
Oh, that's so cool.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.380
Carla:
Our whole family is... They're all about the

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.750
salt. Our whole family is... They're all about
the salt.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.350
Vanessa:
How did you enjoy that vocabulary lesson?

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:26.530
I hope it was useful and enjoyable for you.
Next, it's time for a grammar lesson, where

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:31.380
we're going to focus on some important phrasal
verbs that you heard in the original conversation

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:37.030
with Carla. Phrasal verbs are an essential
key to English sentences to help you sound

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:41.070
natural. So I hope that the phrasal verbs
we talk about in this lesson will help you

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:46.540
to expand what you can say and also to understand
native speakers better. All right, let's get

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.540
started.
Vanessa:

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:53.920
The first phrasal verb that we're going to
talk about is "to use up." And when we use

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.420
something, you're just making use of it. But
what is "use up"? Is it putting it up high?

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.160
Dan:
No. That means you have finished something.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.160
Vanessa:
Completely.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.160
Dan:
Or used something completely, and we often

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:13.030
use this for things in the kitchen. For example,
we eat a lot of oatmeal. Therefore we have

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:18.760
used up the oatmeal. Or if somebody is looking
for something in the kitchen, they might say,

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.700
"Where's the oatmeal? Where's the flour? Where's
the milk?" And you can say, "Oh, I'm sorry

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.000
I used up all the milk."
Vanessa:

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.630
Or we could split this phrasal verb and say,
"I used it up" because we already know that

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.750
we're talking about milk, so we can just replace
the word "milk" with "it." "Oh, sorry. I used

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.270
it up when I was making some hot chocolate
last night, or when I was doing something

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:45.090
else." "I used it up" or "I used up the milk."
It's completely gone, but we can also use

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.640
this a little bit more figuratively.
Dan:

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:54.220
Yeah. People do use it figuratively sometimes.
Maybe they say, "I've used up my energy."

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.660
If you're awake, you probably still have energy,
but if you're just really tired, you could

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.460
say, "I've used up my energy."
Vanessa:

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.580
Yep. I'm completely ready to rest.
Dan:

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.580
Yeah. And perhaps somebody will say, "I've
used up my patience."

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.600
Vanessa:
Oh! Okay.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.620
Dan:
That means that you're not going to wait for

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:17.480
somebody anymore. Or sometimes if you have
a child, they may be... Oh, our kid does this

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:22.980
all the time, just trying to distract you
and do one more thing and just keep on doing

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:27.770
what he's doing and not listening. You could
say, "All right, I've used up all my patience"

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.560
or "I've used up my patience."
Vanessa:

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.210
Let's do this. Let's go.
Dan:

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.410
"It's time to go to bed now."
Vanessa:

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:37.870
Yeah, you might use this. If you're a teacher,
you might say, "Ugh, today was such a hard

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:43.480
day. I used up all my patience, and I'm ready
to go home." So you can use up something that's

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:49.880
a little bit more figurative, like patience,
energy, or you can also use up money, like

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:57.150
if you are saving to buy maybe a new car.
And then you buy the car, you can say, "I

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:03.350
used up all my savings to buy the car." So
your savings is completely gone. Your savings

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:10.440
account is at zero, or figuratively, maybe
close to zero, and you've used up that money.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.600
Carla:
Instead of boiling the water, boiling to evaporate

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.950
it, using up all the valuable wood that they
needed for other things back then, they realized

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:24.290
that they needed to create these ponds using
these clay beds. And using up all the valuable

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:29.080
wood that they needed for other things back
then and using up all the valuable wood that

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.030
they needed for other things back then.
Vanessa:

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:37.680
The next phrasal verb is "to come from," and
here we're talking about originating at some

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.670
destination, but I want to let you know that
we do not use this to talk about your country.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:48.550
If someone says, "Oh, where are you from?"
If you said, "I come from Brazil," it feels

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:53.300
really weird. It's kind of like you're a package
that's being mailed from Brazil.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.100
Dan:
Yeah, it sounds too impersonal or like a real

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.690
origin, like "I was born in Brazil," right?
"Brazil made me."

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.690
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.490
Dan:
It's kind of got a weird feel to it.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.850
Vanessa:
You might hear this in really, really formal

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.760
situations, but I just want to let you know
upfront that we don't talk about this specifically

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.860
for your home country, but there's a lot of
other ways that we can talk about "come from"

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:21.060
for people or for items. So what do you think
is a main way that we use "to come from"?

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.910
Dan:
So I think somebody might use this in a question

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:29.510
a lot if they don't know where something came
from. So if there's something in your house

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:33.880
that you don't know where it's from, you might
ask, "Where did this come from?"

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.880
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.761
Dan:
And then Vanessa might say, "Oh, it came from

00:42:36.761 --> 00:42:38.190
Target," for example.
Vanessa:

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.430
It came from Amazon.
Dan:

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.840
Yeah, it came from Amazon.
Vanessa:

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.020
The most likely situation.
Dan:

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.020
Yes.
Vanessa:

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:47.620
So if you are a walking in someone's house
that you haven't been in before, and they

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.080
have a really cool statue, a really cool painting,
you could say, "Oh, that's really cool. Where

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:58.140
did that come from?" And you can use it in
that questioning situation, "Where did it

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.690
come from?" But we can also use this for maybe
for defending yourself as well. Like, "I don't

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:09.860
know where it came from." This is kind of
the classic teenage situation that if your

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:16.440
mom goes into your bedroom and she smells
weed, for example, which is marijuana. So

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.970
if she smells that and she's like, "What is
that smell?" You're like, "Oh, mom, I don't

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:25.040
know where that smell came from." You're kind
of defending yourself. "It wasn't me!"

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040
Dan:
Sure!

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.380
Vanessa:
So you might say, "I don't know where it came

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.930
from," and this is a vague sense. We're not
talking specifically about the destination.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.460
Dan:
Or you might say, "Where'd that come from?"

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.870
Vanessa:
"Oh, where'd that come from? My friend must

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:41.740
have put that in my bag. I didn't even know.
Where did that come from?" So we often use

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:46.340
it in those kind of vague situations. "Where
did that come from? I don't know where it

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.340
came from."
Dan:

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.780
And actually, people use that question if
they're really surprised about something somebody

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:58.220
said, if you say something really rude or
mean, you might ask, "Where'd that come from?"

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.780
Vanessa:
Oh, so this is kind of the figurative sense

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.780
of using it.
Dan:

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.070
Yeah, a little more figurative.
Vanessa:

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:07.550
If someone is pretty positive, and you're
having a good conversation, then all of a

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:13.070
sudden they say, "Oh, it's so terrible, blah,
blah, blah." And they feel really frustrated,

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:18.380
right, instantly, you might say, "Whoa, where
did that frustration come from?" So it's like,

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.270
where did your frustration originate from?
Because all of a sudden, you just kind of

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.620
felt frustrated. It seemed kind of weird that
that just happened.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.510
Dan:
But you would always ask, "Where did that

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:29.560
come from?"
Vanessa:

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.780
Yeah. "Whoa. Where'd that come from?" That
means that statement or that feeling that

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:39.810
you're expressing. But there is another figurative
way that we can use this that is often used,

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.810
quite interesting.
Dan:

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.700
Yes, "You need to see where I'm coming from."
Vanessa:

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.700
Oh, yes.
Dan:

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.830
Or "Can't you see where I'm coming from?"
Vanessa:

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.060
What does this mean? "Can't you see where
I'm coming from?" Does it mean my home? I'm

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.230
coming from my home?
Dan:

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:58.200
No. It means your point of view, from your
perspective or your opinion. So if you say

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.340
this to somebody, you're basically telling
them that they're only thinking about themselves,

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:08.810
only thinking about their feelings. So if
you say, "You need to see where I'm coming

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:14.960
from," that kind of reminds them that you
have an opinion or a feeling in this situation.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.560
Vanessa:
I know I've used that in discussions or arguments

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.560
with Dan before.
Dan:

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.560
Oh, yes.
Vanessa:

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:25.650
Where I've said, "Oh, can't you see where
I'm coming from?" Just to put in perspective

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.650
that-
Dan:

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.230
It's probably a common female refrain.
Vanessa:

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:35.160
Maybe just "Please see it from my perspective."
And it's not necessarily rude. It's just saying,

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:40.780
"Okay, please look at it from my perspective.
Can't you see where I'm coming from?" Or "Don't

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:46.570
you see where I'm coming from?" You're asking
them to say, "Okay, I understand why you have

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:53.820
that point of view. Maybe I don't agree with
it, but I understand." So this could be if,

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.461
for example, maybe if you don't agree with
something that your parents say and you feel

00:45:57.461 --> 00:46:02.910
like, "Oh, their generation is so different,"
you might think to yourself, "I understand

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:07.240
where they're coming from. I understand their
point of view because of the way they grew

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.080
up, because of their parents, because the
world was very different back then. So I understand

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.690
where they're coming from. I understand their
point of view. That's kind of the origin of

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.290
their thoughts." This is a lovely phrasal
verb with many different meanings.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.420
Carla:
But you'll see all different colors, and all

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.430
those different colors come from different
mineral compositions coming from the different

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:30.570
regions. And all those different colors come
from different mineral compositions coming

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:34.640
from the different regions. And all those
different colors come from different mineral

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.310
compositions coming from the different regions.
Vanessa:

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:43.280
The next phrasal verb is "to start off" or
"to start off with something," and you can

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:49.450
imagine the verb "to start" is the beginning.
But when we use "to start off with," we usually

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:54.940
are talking about the beginning of some kind
of series of events. So multiple things are

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:59.850
happening afterwards. For example, if I said,
"Oh, man, I really, I want to make bread,

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:06.330
but I don't know how to make bread." If Dan
is a bread expert, he might say, "To start

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.620
off with, you need to have a good recipe."
Dan:

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.240
Toss the flour into the air.
Vanessa:

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.780
Oh, wow. You're really an expert.
Dan:

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.670
That's from the magic of practice.
Vanessa:

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:20.370
Throw flour in the air, and it just comes
down like a loaf of bread. Amazing. So we're

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:25.010
saying, "to start off with, you need to do
this." We're using that phrasal verb kind

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:31.060
of as an introduction to the series. "To start
off with, you need to do this and here's kind

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.680
of the things that you need to do."
Dan:

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:37.500
Yeah, I think you use this usually when you're
introducing something or if you're giving

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:42.800
instructions. So if you're giving instructions,
you might tell the other person, "We need

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.342
to start off with this" or if you're-
Vanessa:

00:47:46.342 --> 00:47:50.350
You need to start off with a good recipe,
then get the ingredients, then have a lot

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:51.350
of time.
Dan:

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:57.920
Right. Or if you are maybe making a presentation,
you might say, "We're going to start off today

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.930
with a little bit of a story," for example.
Vanessa:

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:09.520
Yeah, so you could use it to begin something
that's going to have several other events

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.540
or activities that happen afterwards. So in
Dan's sentence, he said, "I'm starting the

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:20.010
meeting by saying, 'Oh, we're going to start
off today with something.'" I want to let

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:24.850
you know that you're also going to hear the
word "by." "We're going to start off today

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:30.780
by telling a joke. We're going to start off
today with telling a joke." You could use

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:36.240
either. You're going to hear both of those,
but the main part, "start off with" or "start

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.140
off," it's going to be the same for all of
these.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.270
Carla:
And the key with salt tasting is you want

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:45.010
to start off with the highest mineral content
salt going to the highest sodium salt. You

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.650
want to start off with the highest mineral
content salt. You want to start off with the

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.390
highest mineral content salt.
Vanessa:

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:55.800
Were any of those phrasal verbs new to you?
I hope that our explanations help you to remember

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:02.320
them and learn how to use them in real conversations.
Next, it's time for a pronunciation lesson.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.180
We're going to take an in depth look at a
couple sentences that you heard in the original

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:13.860
conversation. I'm going to break those down
step by step so that you can imitate our pronunciation.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.820
So what I want you to do is I want you to
try to repeat with me, speak out loud, use

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.530
your pronunciation muscles. It's great to
hear me, but it's even better if you speak

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:27.720
out loud yourself. So I challenge you to be
active, and let's get started.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.630
Vanessa:
Hi. Welcome to this month's pronunciation

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:35.390
lesson. Today we're going to be focusing on
five sentences that you heard in the conversation

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:41.310
with Carla. And each of those sentences features
a vocabulary expression or a phrasal verb

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:46.140
that we talked about in the previous lessons,
so I hope that this will help you to remember

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:50.160
those words and pronounce them correctly.
What we're going to do is we're going to take

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.080
a look at the clip, and then I'm going to
help you break down the sentence so that you

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.100
can say it exactly the way that we did, and
then we're going to watch it again. I hope

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.180
that your understanding will improve, but
also your pronunciation skills. All right,

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.920
let's start with the first sentence.
Carla:

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.790
So this started a very sustainable practice
that has lasted hundreds of years, and it's

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:14.910
still there today. This started a very sustainable
practice that has lasted hundreds of years.

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:18.940
This started a very sustainable practice that
has lasted hundreds of years.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.220
Vanessa:
In this sentence, you heard Carla say, "This

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:29.700
started a very sustainable practice that has
lasted hundreds of years." She's talking about

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:35.560
the method of creating salt. Instead of burning
wood, they're using the sun to evaporate the

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:41.670
water, and this is a sustainable process.
The sun is always going to be hot, so it's

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:46.630
easy to evaporate with the sun, and it's sustainable
for the earth as well. So let's break down

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.630
this sentence starting at the beginning.
Vanessa:

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:59.560
In the beginning of the sentence, she says,
"This started." "Started." This e-d word "started"

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:09.510
ends in an "id" sound. "Started." What's another
sound that you hear? The word "start" ends

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:17.480
in a T, but this T is changing to a D. This
is super typical in American English that

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:24.640
T's changed to D sounds. So I want you to
say this with me. "This started." It kind

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:33.260
of sounds like "star" plus "did." "Started."
"This started." "This started." I want you

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.900
to be as active as possible during this lesson.
So whenever I'm saying something, and I'm

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:41.541
repeating something a couple of times, I hope
that you can say it out loud, too. It's great

00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:45.040
to listen to my voice, but it's even better
if you can say it out loud yourself.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.190
Vanessa:
All right, let's go to the next part of the

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:56.020
sentence. "A very sustainable practice. A
very sustainable practice." Let's break down

00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:06.720
that big word here. Sustain-able. That final
part sounds like "uh." "Sustainable." There's

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:16.170
two "uh" sounds here at the beginning. Sus-tain-a-ble.
So I want you to say that part with me. "A

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:22.440
very sustainable practice. A very sustainable
practice."

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:27.820
Vanessa:
In the next two words, she says, "That has.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:36.740
That has." First, let's listen for the vowel
sound. "Th-a-a." It's a short E. Even though

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:44.310
the word "that" has an A, "that" often in
fast English, it becomes "theh," "eh," "eh."

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:53.660
"That has. That has. That has." But what's
happening to the final T in that word? "That."

00:52:53.660 --> 00:53:01.751
Do you hear it all? "That has." This is called
a stopped T. So instead of making that T sound

00:53:01.751 --> 00:53:08.180
with a puff of air, your tongue is going to
stop at the top of your mouth. "That has."

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:13.110
That has." You're making a T sound. You're
just not letting that puff of air escape.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:22.100
"That has." "That has." And then she says,
"lasted hundreds of years." "Lasted."

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.590
Vanessa:
Ooh, does that sound familiar? It's similar

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:39.700
to "started." "We have lasted." So just think
l-a-s, "las," plus "did", d-i-d. "Lasted."

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:49.580
"Lasted hundreds of years. Lasted hundreds
of years." So both past tense verbs, "started,"

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:56.090
"lasted," have the same type of pronunciation.
The T is changing to a D, and that final e-d

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:01.910
ending is going to sound like "id." "Started."
"Lasted." Do you think we can put this all

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:05.780
together? Let's go back and take a look at
this full sentence? Try to remember all those

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:09.770
things we talked about and we're going to
see which words are emphasized so that you

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:12.860
can have the right cadence and rhythm in this
sentence.

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:18.450
Vanessa:
"This started a very sustainable practice

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:26.530
that has lasted hundreds of years." She's
emphasizing "started." "This started a very

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:34.670
sustainable practice," emphasizing both of
those words, "that has lasted hundreds of

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:40.420
years." She also emphasizes the word "hundreds"
because that's the unimportant part of the

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:45.520
sentence. How many years? Hundreds of years.
Let's go back and try to say this sentence

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:52.950
by emphasizing those important words. "This
started a very sustainable practice that has

00:54:52.950 --> 00:55:01.250
lasted hundreds of years." You want to say
it with me? "This started a very sustainable

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:08.290
practice that has lasted hundreds of years."
All right. It's your turn. I'm going to pause.

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:12.610
No matter where you live around the world,
I'll be listening, so make sure that you say

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:17.540
this out loud with all of the correct pronunciation
that we talked about. If you need a reminder,

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:21.470
you could always check out the lesson guide.
Each month I send a monthly lesson guide.

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:26.110
This is like a mini textbook, and you can
see all of the words that we've talked about

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:30.270
and see how they're pronounced, and that will
kind of give you a a good reminder as you're

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:35.440
practicing this lesson. All right, it's your
turn. Say the sentence all by yourself.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.690
Vanessa:
(silence)

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:42.300
Vanessa:
Great work. Let's listen to how Carla said

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.350
it in the original conversation.
Carla:

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:49.240
This started a very sustainable practice that
has lasted hundreds of years. This started

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:55.369
a very sustainable practice that has lasted
hundreds of years. This started a very sustainable

00:55:55.369 --> 00:55:57.750
practice that has lasted hundreds of years.
Vanessa:

00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:03.280
Did you hear those e-d words, "started," "lasted"?
I hope so. Let's go on to the second sentence

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.080
where you're going to hear the phrasal verb
"to come from." Let's listen.

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.180
Carla:
But you'll see all different colors, and all

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:13.200
those different colors come from different
mineral compositions coming from the different

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:19.620
regions. We even have a super white, white
salt from Hawaii. All those different colors

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:24.530
come from different mineral compositions coming
from the different regions and all those different

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:28.040
colors come from different mineral compositions
coming from the different regions.

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.970
Vanessa:
In this sentence, Carla said, "All those different

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:37.710
colors come from different mineral compositions
coming from different regions." Do you hear

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:44.930
a word that she repeats three times? She says
"come from" twice, but she also says "different"

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:51.000
three times. So today this is your chance
to master pronouncing this word. Let's go

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.840
back to the beginning and try to say this
a little bit by a little bit together. "All

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:01.970
those different colors." This is the first
time that we've encountered the word "different"

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:11.030
in the sentence. So let's say it slowly and
together. Dif-rent. "Diff" with a clear F

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:19.910
sound. Your top teeth are on your bottom lip.
"Diff." And then we have "rent, rent." It

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:27.501
kind of sounds like r-i-n, but we need to
have a stopped T at the end. Diff-rent. That

00:57:27.501 --> 00:57:33.340
means that your tongue is stopped at the top
of your mouth. You're going to say "different,"

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.130
but you don't let that little final puff of
air come out.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:39.530
Vanessa:
So we need to say "diff-rent." Your tongue

00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:46.310
is stopped at the top of your mouth. "Different,
different." "All those different colors."

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:53.201
Can you say that with me? "All those different
colors. All those different colors. All of

00:57:53.201 --> 00:58:02.910
those different colors come from diff-rent
mineral compositions." Let's say that word

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:13.760
again. "Come from diff-rent mineral compositions.
Come from diff-rent mineral compositions.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:21.700
Coming from diff-rent regions." This word
hasn't changed at all. All three times that

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:27.580
we say it, it's going to be the same pronunciation.
Helpful. Great. So let's say that final part

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:40.190
again. "Coming from diff-rent regions. Coming
from diff-rent regions." Great work. Let's

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:43.960
go back and say this full sentence together
and try to emphasize the important words.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.640
Vanessa:
A good thing to remember is that the word

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:51.710
directly after "different" is going to be
emphasized in this whole sentence. So we can

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:59.290
say, "All those different colors come from
different mineral compositions coming from

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:06.510
different regions." So we have "colors," "mineral
compositions" and "regions." Let's try to

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:14.440
say it together. "All those different colors
come from different mineral compositions coming

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:21.200
from different regions." Let's speed it up.
"All those different colors come from different

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:26.040
compositions coming from different regions."
This is a great way to practice the word "different"

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:31.850
a lot and also the word "come from." I think
this phrasal verb is repeated enough that

00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:35.200
hopefully you'll remember it after this lesson.
All right, I'm going to pause and I want you

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.790
to say this all together. Make sure that you
say "diff-rent" and also that you emphasize

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:47.020
those correct words. Go ahead.
Vanessa:

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.850
(silence)
Vanessa:

00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:53.390
Great work. Let's listen to her repeat the
word "different" a lot.

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:55.521
Carla:
All those different colors come from different

00:59:55.521 --> 00:59:59.810
mineral compositions coming from the different
regions. And all those different colors come

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:03.790
from different mineral compositions coming
from the different regions. And all those

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:08.110
different colors come from different mineral
compositions coming from the different regions.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:11.740
Vanessa:
Did you hear "different, different, different"?

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.300
I hope so. Let's go on to the third sentence
where you're going to hear the expression

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.790
to be all about." Let's listen.
Carla:

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:20.850
Our whole family is... They're all about the
salt.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:21.850
Vanessa:
Sure.

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.570
Carla:
They send us pictures. "I'm at this grocery

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:25.850
store. Here it is," or "I'm in this country
here," so it's fun.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:26.850
Vanessa:
Oh, that's so cool.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:29.550
Carla:
Our whole family is... They're all about the

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:32.980
salt. Our whole family is... They're all about
the salt.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.450
Vanessa:
This is actually two sentences, and I just

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:42.050
decided to add them together. She said, "Our
whole family is... they're all about the salt."

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:46.740
Let's break this down. It's seems like a short
sentence, but there's a lot going on. At the

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:53.900
beginning of this sentence. She says, "Our
whole family is... Our whole family is...

01:00:53.900 --> 01:01:02.140
Our." How is she pronouncing o-u-r? "Our.
Our." Does that sound like the letter R? Yep.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:13.290
It is the same pronunciation. When we say
"our, our" with this slower, clearer pronunciation,

01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:21.460
"Our whole family is... Our," it's going to
be for more... slower conversations, a little

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:28.369
bit more intentional, but in fast conversations
we just say "our." "Our whole family is..."

01:01:28.369 --> 01:01:36.010
"Our. Our." So I want you to say that with
me. "Our whole family is... Our whole family

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:43.230
is..." And that final word, i-s, "is" going
to have a Z sound at the end. So try to say

01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:52.980
that with me. "Our whole family is... Our
whole family is... Our whole family is...

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.310
Our whole family is... Our whole family is..."
Vanessa:

01:01:56.310 --> 01:02:01.230
Let's go on to the next part. "They're all
about the salt. They're all about the salt."

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:07.420
Let's start with the first word, "They're.
They're." This is a contraction of "they"

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:15.390
plus "are," but she doesn't say "they're.
They're." This is the clear pronunciation

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:21.030
for this contraction. In fast conversations,
native speakers are just going to say "they're.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:28.120
They're." It kind of sounds like, "Look over
there. He's over there." T-h-e-r-e. So you

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:36.920
can kind of imagine that the Y is just gone.
You can say, "They're. They're. They're all

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.220
about the salt. They're. They're."
Vanessa:

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:47.700
And the next part she uses the key expression
here, "all about the salt." Listen for the

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:58.740
final T on those two words that end in T.
"They're all about the salt. They're all about

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:04.930
the salt." Do you hear the T? "They're all
about the salt. No. Instead, this is going

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:09.810
to be that stopped T sound, so I want your
tongue on the roof of your mouth, stopping

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:20.230
at the end of that word. "They're all about
the salt. Salt, salt." If you just say "Sal,"

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:27.020
it's a different sound than "salt" with a
stopped T. If you just say s-o-l compared

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:35.500
to s-o-l, "Sol, Sol" with a stopped T, or
it's pronounced or it's spelled s-a-l-t, but

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:40.731
the pronunciation is kind of like an O. That's
why I said that, but you can say "Sol" with

01:03:40.731 --> 01:03:43.440
a stopped T, and it's going to sound much
more natural.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.460
Vanessa:
Do you think we can put that final sentence

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:55.280
together? "They're all about the salt." Say
it with me. "They're all about the salt. They're

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.470
all about the salt." Okay, let's go back and
try to say all of this together, including

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:07.359
the first part. Let's say it and emphasize
the right words. "Our whole family is... They're

01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:14.810
all about the salt. Our whole family is...
They're all about the salt." Can you guess

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:24.830
what we're emphasizing here? "Our whole family
is... They're all about the salt." So we have

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:32.660
"whole family." "all" and "salt." Let's say
this all together. Remember all of the reductions

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:39.900
that we talked about and also these emphasized
words. Say it with me. "Our whole family is...

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:48.020
They're all about the salt. Our whole family
is... They're all about the salt. Our whole

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:54.980
family is... They're all about the salt. Now
it's your turn. Say it all by yourself. Go

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.750
ahead.
Vanessa:

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.519
(silence)
Vanessa:

01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:01.890
Great work. All right, let's listen to this
sentence, and I want you to listen for all

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:06.170
of those things that we talked about, those
reductions, the stopped T's. Let's listen.

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:09.460
Carla:
Our whole family is... They're all about the

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:15.180
salt. Our whole family is... They're all about
the salt. Our whole family is. They're all

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.271
about the salt."
Vanessa:

01:05:16.271 --> 01:05:21.940
Are your pronunciation muscles warmed up?
I hope so. Along with the conversation, vocabulary,

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:27.840
grammar, and pronunciation lessons, you'll
also get access to the MP3 versions of all

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.700
of these lessons so that you can download
them, listen to them while you're driving,

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:36.820
while you're running, while you're cooking
breakfast, and also the full transcript so

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.570
that you can follow along and try to catch
every single word. There's one more element

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:45.760
to the Fearless Fluency Club that you get
every month and that is The Story. Let's take

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.500
a look at it.
Vanessa:

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:53.470
The Story is a fun one-page combination of
everything you studied this month, vocabulary,

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:59.180
grammar, pronunciation, the topic, everything
is combined in The Story. You can listen to

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:05.900
it, repeat it, and even memorize it. I also
host weekly live lessons in our private Facebook

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.610
group so that you can ask me questions and
practice what you've been learning each week.

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:17.080
A lot of members also choose to speak together
each week or even daily, sometimes on Skype,

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.540
Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger.
This is a great way to make friends around

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:27.530
the world and also to use English actively.
