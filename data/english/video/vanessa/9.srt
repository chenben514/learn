00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Vanessa:

from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Are you&nbsp;
ready to learn a lot of English? Let's do it.&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.240
I have something secret, surprise to show you.&nbsp;
Over the past couple months, I've been creating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.240
some quick 30-second to one-minute English lessons&nbsp;
every day for a social media channel that I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

check out my code here so that you can follow me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.480
and watch those lessons. But I thought, why should&nbsp;
my YouTube students miss out on these lessons?&nbsp;

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.320
So today, I have combined all of them, all of&nbsp;
these quick, rapid-fire English lessons into one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.280
long lesson to share with you. I hope that you&nbsp;
enjoy it. They're all filmed with my phone, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.080
I think that they'll still be useful for you. They&nbsp;
are for, generally, beginner or early intermediate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.920
English learners, so I hope that you'll be able&nbsp;
to learn a lot of vocabulary, grammar, idioms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.920
pronunciation, a lot of fun, useful tips in these&nbsp;
lessons. Are you ready to get started? Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.960
start the rapid-fire English lessons. Let's go.
Welcome to our family. I'm Vanessa. This is Dan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.440
Theo, Freddy, Pippen and Luna. This week, you&nbsp;
will get to know more about our family. I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.520
to get to know more about you. Tell me how many&nbsp;
people are in your family. There are four people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.240
in my family, plus two cats. You will get to know&nbsp;
more about us and you will get to know more about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.520
English. I can't wait. This is my husband, Dan.
Dan:&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.080
Hi.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.840
What do you like to do in your free time?&nbsp;

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.680
Dan:
I like to play disc golf.&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.840
Vanessa:
Oh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.320
Yeah, Dan's really into disc&nbsp;
golf. What else are you into?&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.320
Dan:
I like to play hockey and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.160
also like to watch ice hockey.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.960
Oh, I'm not really into hockey, but I like&nbsp;
watching you play on your own team. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.840
about you? What are you into? You can use&nbsp;
this expression to be into something to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.080
about your interests. Dan's into hockey,&nbsp;
Dan's into disc golf. Meet my oldest son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.400
What's your name?
Theo:&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.120
Theo.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.080
Theo. And how old are you, Theo?
Theo:&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.880
Three.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.480
That's great. He's three years old. Who is this?
Theo:&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.840
White squirrel.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.000
Wow. White squirrel is Theo's favorite stuffed&nbsp;
animal. Stuffed animal is an animal that children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.160
love to play with. Notice the pronunciation,&nbsp;
stuffed, stuffed animal. The ED ending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.520
sounds like a T. Stuffed animal. Meet my new&nbsp;
baby, Freddy. Freddy, how old are you? Oh, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.000
doesn't talk yet. He's learning English like you.&nbsp;
He's four months old. He likes to chew everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.880
kind of like a dog, but because he doesn't&nbsp;
have teeth, he gums things, he uses his gums.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.120
Thankfully, he's a very easygoing baby. Easygoing&nbsp;
means relaxed. He doesn't cry much. He never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.520
screams. I don't think it's because of my skill as&nbsp;
a mother, I think it's just his personality. He's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.680
easygoing. What about you? Are you easygoing?
Meet my fat cat, Pippen. We bought Pippen from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.080
an animal shelter when he was only six months&nbsp;
old. He was alone and scared, and we saved him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.520
Pippen's favorite activity is staring&nbsp;
out the window and watching the birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.440
Sometimes, he goes outside and stares at&nbsp;
the birds closer. To stare is like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.080
to look without blinking.&nbsp;
Thankfully, he's never caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.600
a bird in real life, only in his imagination.
Meet my silly cat, Luna. There's one thing you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.920
need to know about Luna, she is a chicken. What?&nbsp;
She doesn't look like a chicken, she looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.120
a cat. But no, she is a chicken. Do you know this&nbsp;
expression? A chicken. To be a chicken means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:30.800
you're scared of everything. If she hears a loud&nbsp;
sound, she runs away. Poor Luna, she's a chicken.&nbsp;

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.800
Welcome to my morning routine. I usually wake&nbsp;
up around 8:00 AM. The phrasal verb to wake up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.520
means your eyes open and you stop sleeping.&nbsp;
Sometimes, my alarm clock wakes me up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.480
sometimes, my baby wakes me&nbsp;
up with his cute little face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:05.040
Good morning. What time do you wake up?&nbsp;
Good morning, my alarm went off. I woke up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:14.800
and now it's time to get ready. I wash my face,&nbsp;
put on some makeup, put on my glasses, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:24.000
put on my clothes. Did you notice that I&nbsp;
used the phrasal verb to put on for makeup,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.600
glasses and clothes? To put on is a really useful&nbsp;
expression to know. So I have a question for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.880
what did you put on today? Let&nbsp;
me know in the comments. Bye.&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.640
Every morning, I pick up my baby,&nbsp;
nurse him and change his clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:54.000
The word clothes sounds like close the door.&nbsp;
Forget the TH, it's clothes. What kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.200
clothes do you want to wear today, Freddy? Do&nbsp;
you want to wear the dinosaurs or the stripes?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:14.480
This one. Okay. The dinosaurs? Let's do it. Baby&nbsp;
clothes are so cute. Do you drink coffee or tea?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:24.720
I never drink coffee, but I love tea. To make tea,&nbsp;
you need a tea kettle full of hot water, a teabag,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:35.600
or loose leaf tea. Pour the hot water over the&nbsp;
teabag and let it steep for three or four minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.720
Now, my day can begin. It's done. What about&nbsp;
you? Do you drink tea or coffee in the morning?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.640
I never drink coffee, but do you&nbsp;
know someone who loves coffee?&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.840
Dan:
I do.&nbsp;

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.520
Vanessa:
Dan, my husband. How do you make coffee?&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.000
Dan:
I grind it, I pour it into a filter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.440
and I put it in the coffee machine and turn it on.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.600
Do you drink black coffee?
Dan:&nbsp;

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:16.800
Sometimes. But usually, I drink coffee with cream.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:24.080
This is a common question about coffee.&nbsp;
Black coffee means no milk and no sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:32.320
Do you drink black coffee? My husband always makes&nbsp;
breakfast for us. He usually whips up some oatmeal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:40.800
with honey and fruit. To whip up to make something&nbsp;
quickly. Do you have a presentation in 30 minutes?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.280
You need to whip up a presentation. Did your&nbsp;
teacher ask you why you were late for class? You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.800
need to whip up a reason. I forgot about school?
If you put on some nice clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:02.080
drink some coffee, and eat a good breakfast,&nbsp;
you can start off on the right foot. What?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.360
The right foot? What about the left&nbsp;
foot? No, no, no. This is an expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.520
To start off on the right foot means that&nbsp;
you have a positive start. I want to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:22.720
off on the right foot every morning so I try to&nbsp;
think some positive thoughts. What do you do to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:29.280
start off on the right foot in the morning?
Welcome to my kitchen. The sink is where I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:38.640
wash dirty dishes. The faucet is where the hot&nbsp;
and cold water come out, and I have hot and cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:48.960
water handles. The countertop, or just counter,&nbsp;
is where I prepare food. The cutting board,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.760
this is a wooden cutting board, is where I&nbsp;
chop food. I keep food in the refrigerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:04.480
Refrigerator is such a big word but I have good&nbsp;
news, usually, we just say fridge. Can you say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:13.200
it with me? Fridge. Ah, it's so much easier.
I cook eggs on the stove and in the oven,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:21.040
I cook chicken. Do you have an oven?&nbsp;
I'm making a typical children's lunch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:32.240
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Sometimes,&nbsp;
we call this PB&amp;J. I'm going to eat a PB&amp;J. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:39.600
I was a child, I ate a peanut butter and jelly&nbsp;
sandwich almost every day. To make this sandwich,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:48.400
you can take a piece of bread, or we can call&nbsp;
this a slice of bread, and spread on the peanut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:57.440
butter. Then, we spread on the jelly, or you&nbsp;
can call this jam. We spread on the peanut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:04.480
butter and the jelly with a knife. Notice that&nbsp;
the K is silent. Can you say this word with me?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:13.760
Knife. Put the top piece on and you're done. So&nbsp;
easy. What about you? Do you like to eat bread?&nbsp;

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.120
To eat food, you need dishes and&nbsp;
silverware, so let's talk about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:35.440
Bowls, notice the W is silent. Bowls, big plates,&nbsp;
little plates, cups, or a glass, glasses, mugs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:49.520
water bottles, a sippy cup, forks, spoons, a&nbsp;
knife, knives. Notice the K is silent. Knives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.560 --> 00:11:04.080
chopsticks. What about you? Do you use chopsticks&nbsp;
every day? I eat rice a lot, do you? I never eat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:17.840
lice. This is rice, and lice are the little bugs&nbsp;
in your hair. It's very important to say rice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:27.840
correctly. To say the R sound, put your teeth&nbsp;
together and pretend like you are an angry dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:39.440
rice, rice. Don't say lice. L is with&nbsp;
your tongue out of your mouth, lice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:51.280
I want to eat rice. I don't want to eat lice.&nbsp;
What about you? Do you eat rice every day?&nbsp;

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.280
Ah, I'm hungry. I'm starving when are we going&nbsp;
to eat? Is dinner ready yet? Dinner's ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:10.000
Do you want some more? Oh, no, thanks.&nbsp;
I'm full. My eyes were bigger than my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.480
stomach. This idiom means that you put too&nbsp;
much food on your plate because you were so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.880
hungry. Now, you can't finish it because you're&nbsp;
full. Maybe you could eat it for a midnight snack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:30.800
What about you? Are you hungry now?
A great way to remember vocabulary is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:40.240
label items in your house. I heat up food in the&nbsp;
microwave. Heat up doesn't mean you're cooking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:46.240
it means you're making it warm&nbsp;
again. I chop meat with knives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:55.040
Chop and cut are the same thing. I put away my&nbsp;
food in the pantry. The pantry is where you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:03.280
keep rice, flour, cans and jars of food. Writing&nbsp;
a key phrase is great, but writing a sentence is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:10.240
better. What do you put in your pantry?
When I was younger, my dad brought home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:17.600
the bacon. Now, I bring home the bacon.&nbsp;
Well, my husband also brings home the bacon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:25.280
What does this idiom mean? Does it mean that we&nbsp;
are eating a lot of bacon? No, it's an expression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:33.040
that means to make money. When I was younger,&nbsp;
my mom watched me and my sister, and my dad went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:41.200
to work. That means that my dad brought home the&nbsp;
bacon. Notice the grammar, I bring home the bacon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:50.160
he brings home the bacon, this is the present&nbsp;
tense, or my dad brought home the bacon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.080
this is the past tense. What about you?&nbsp;
Who brings home the bacon in your family?&nbsp;

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:04.560
Welcome to the outdoors. My family has a&nbsp;
weekly goal, to go hiking once a week, rain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:12.000
or shine. This expression rain or shine means&nbsp;
that we will do the activity if it's raining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.640
or if the sun is shining. We will do it&nbsp;
in any weather. We use this expression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:26.160
all the time. The outdoor concert will happen&nbsp;
rain or shine. The running race will happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.800
rain or shine. What about you?&nbsp;
What do you like to do outside?&nbsp;

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.400
I'm a busy bee. I take care of my three-year-old&nbsp;
son, I take care of my five-month-old son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.000
I take care of my house, I take care of my&nbsp;
English teaching business, I take care of myself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.720
and sometimes, I take care of my husband too. Can&nbsp;
you guess what to be a busy bee means? It means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.720 --> 00:15:00.640
I'm really busy. This bee is busy getting the&nbsp;
pollen from all of the flowers. He is a busy bee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.080
But I'm also a busy bee. What&nbsp;
about you? Are you a busy bee?&nbsp;

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.320
I'm going for a walk in my neighborhood.&nbsp;
I'm going for a hike in the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.320
You can say I'm walking, or I'm hiking,&nbsp;
but it's much more natural to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.440
I'm going for a walk, do you want to join me? I'm&nbsp;
going for a hike, do you want to come with me?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:44.720
This hiking trail is rocky, or this path is&nbsp;
rocky. Path, path. Do you see my tongue? Path.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:58.480
It's between my teeth. Oh, teeth. Say it&nbsp;
with me. Teeth, path. Your tongue should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:08.080
be out of your mouth and between your teeth,&nbsp;
with a stream of air flowing out. Teeth, path.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:17.120
Say it with me, I go for a hike on&nbsp;
the path. I go for a hike on the path.&nbsp;

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.320
When you feel amazing, when you feel&nbsp;
wonderful, you are on top of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:36.560
I'm on top of the world. Did you just get a&nbsp;
promotion at work? You are on top of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.920
Did you just speak with someone in English? You're&nbsp;
on top of the world. Did you make an amazing meal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:52.320
and everyone loved it? You feel on top of the&nbsp;
world. Say it with me, I'm on top of the world.&nbsp;

00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:04.160
I went for a walk yesterday. I go for a walk&nbsp;
every day. I am going to go for a walk tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:14.240
I have gone for a walk every day for three&nbsp;
months. I enjoy the nature when I was pregnant. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.840
enjoy nature now in the summer. I am&nbsp;
going to enjoy nature in the fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:29.200
I have enjoyed nature every day of my life.
Do you feel tired? Do you feel annoyed?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:37.840
When I feel tired and annoyed, I go&nbsp;
outside to clear my mind. I feel relaxed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:50.480
I feel calm, I feel happy when I go outside.&nbsp;
Let's practice this pronunciation. Clears, clears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.440 --> 00:18:00.800
Notice the L, my tongue is outside of my mouth.&nbsp;
Clears, and the R at the end, my tongue is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:10.880
outside my mouth. Say it with me, going outside&nbsp;
clears my mind. Going outside clears my mind.&nbsp;

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:19.120
Welcome to my workout. It's important to exercise&nbsp;
every day. The word exercise and workout mean the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:27.120
same thing. Some people work out at the gym, but I&nbsp;
don't work out at the gym, I exercise at home. Do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:35.440
you work out at the gym or at home? Some different&nbsp;
types of exercises are running or jogging,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:48.720
yoga, Pilates, jumping rope, Tai chi,&nbsp;
martial arts, pull-ups, sit-ups, squats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.840 --> 00:19:06.000
lunges, lifting weights, or weightlifting.&nbsp;
What exercises do you do? Vanessa works out on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:18.880
Wednesdays. Vanessa lifts weights very often. V,&nbsp;
my teeth are on my bottom lip with some vibration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:34.960
Vanessa. Say it with me, Vanessa. W, my lips&nbsp;
make an wooh shape. Work. Say it with me, work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:43.280
Let's say the challenge sentence.&nbsp;
Vanessa works out on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:59.920
Vanessa lifts weights very often. Great work.
I do some exercises. He does some exercises. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:13.600
do yoga. She does yoga. I do Pilates. He does&nbsp;
Pilates. I do martial arts. They do martial arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:27.360
I do squats. They do squats. I do weightlifting.&nbsp;
We do weightlifting. I run. They run.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:38.320
What about you? Do you do yoga? When I&nbsp;
work out, my muscles get strong. Muscles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:48.960
Notice the C is silent. Muscles. Don't say&nbsp;
muscles. No, no, no. The C is silent. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.920 --> 00:21:00.480
don't have strong muscles. What about you? Do&nbsp;
you have strong muscles? Why do you work out?&nbsp;

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.960
Dan:
To get strong, to get fit, to get in shape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.920
to get buff, and to get ripped.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:23.840
What about you? Why do you work out? Before&nbsp;
I exercise, I need to warm up my muscles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:35.200
To warm up means to stretch my muscles. After&nbsp;
I exercise, I need to cool down. To cool down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:44.320
means to stretch my muscles. Can you say it with&nbsp;
me? I warm up, then I cool down. Great work.&nbsp;

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:53.360
When should you say hello, hi, or hey?&nbsp;
Hello is for structured situations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:02.400
on the phone or giving a presentation. Hi is&nbsp;
for your boss, your coworkers, your family, your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:11.840
friends, anyone. Hey is for people you are close&nbsp;
with, your sister, your husband, your friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:19.200
Write a greeting to me in the comments,&nbsp;
like, hi, Vanessa. Is it normal to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:27.440
how are you in English? No, we rarely&nbsp;
say this. Instead, you can say...&nbsp;

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.800
Dan:
How's it going? How's it going?&nbsp;

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:37.200
Vanessa:
Good. This means is your life going well? Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:44.160
my life is going well. English speakers&nbsp;
feel comfortable being casual with everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:53.520
We like to be friends with everyone. You can ask&nbsp;
how's it going with your boss, your family, your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:02.640
teacher, me, and your friends. Now I want to ask&nbsp;
you, how's it going? Should you say thank you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:12.000
everyone? Yes, English speakers love to say thank&nbsp;
you. I recommend saying thank you. This is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.160
bigger actions. For example, thank you for taking&nbsp;
care of my cats when I went on vacation. Thanks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:29.280
this is for small actions. Thanks for holding&nbsp;
the door. Thanks for bringing me some coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:38.560
Do you want to thank someone a lot? Just add so&nbsp;
much. Thank you so much for learning English with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:46.080
me. Thanks so much for learning English with&nbsp;
me. Can you say thank you in the comments?&nbsp;

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:55.040
When someone says thank you, what can you say?&nbsp;
For big actions, you can say you're welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.200
It's my pleasure. For example...
Dan:&nbsp;

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.160
Thank you for teaching me English.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:08.880
You're welcome. It's my pleasure to teach&nbsp;
you English. For small actions, you can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.560
no problem. For example...
Dan:&nbsp;

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.600
Thank you for making this lesson.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.640
No problem. Thank you for being my&nbsp;
student. How can you respond? Oh no,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:31.280
you did something wrong. What should you&nbsp;
say? Just say I'm sorry. It's simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.840
it's clear, it's polite. Why are you late?
Dan:&nbsp;

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.840
I'm sorry.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.320
You forgot to buy rice.
Dan:&nbsp;

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.240
I'm sorry.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:49.680
Did you bump someone by accident? You&nbsp;
can say I'm sorry, or you can say...&nbsp;

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.760
Dan:
Sorry about that.&nbsp;

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.680
Vanessa:
Sorry about that is casual. If you bump me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.960
what would you say?
Dan:&nbsp;

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.120
Oh, I'm sorry.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:13.760
What should you say? You can say, it's okay, or&nbsp;
no problem. You can say this in any situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:22.000
For example, your boss forgot to give you a paper&nbsp;
and he says, "I'm sorry that I forgot that paper."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.080
You can say...
Dan:&nbsp;

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.720
It's okay. No problem.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.400
Your friend is late to your dinner party and&nbsp;
your friend says, "I'm sorry that I'm late."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.480
You can say...
Dan:&nbsp;

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.040
It's okay. No problem.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:43.760
I'm sorry that sometimes, I speak too fast.&nbsp;
What can you say to me in the comments?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:53.520
Is it okay to say goodbye? No, no, no, no.&nbsp;
This is too serious. Instead, you can say...&nbsp;

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.840
Dan:
Bye. See you later.&nbsp;

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.400
Vanessa:
When you finish working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.120
you can tell your coworkers...
Dan:&nbsp;

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.440
Bye. See you later.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.880
When your class is finished, you can&nbsp;
tell your teacher and your classmates...&nbsp;

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.120
Dan:
Bye. See you tomorrow.&nbsp;

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.947
Vanessa:
Bye, see you later, bye, see you tomorrow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:23.840
is very common for saying goodbye. Now, I'm&nbsp;
finishing this lesson, what can you say to me?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.280
It's family time. Can you answer some&nbsp;
common small talk questions about family?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.200
Do you have a big family?
Dan:&nbsp;

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.880
Yes, I have a lot of family members.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.400
Do you live close to your family?
Dan:&nbsp;

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.120
No, they live far away.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.400
Do you see your family often?
Dan:&nbsp;

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.760
No, I see them twice a year.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

00:26:51.760 --> 00:27:05.200
Tell me in the comments, do you have a big family?&nbsp;
Daughter. Daughter. I am a daughter. Notice the G&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:19.240
and H are silent. Daughter. Notice the T changes&nbsp;
to D in American English. Daughter, der, daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:32.880
Don't forget a clear R at the end of the word.&nbsp;
Daughter. Say it with me, daughter. I am a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:44.720
daughter. Are you a daughter? Don't say mother and&nbsp;
father to your parents. It's too formal. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:57.600
you can say not mother, mom, or children can&nbsp;
say mommy, not father, but you can say dad, or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:09.360
children can say daddy, not grandmother, you can&nbsp;
say grandma, not grandfather, you can say grandpa.&nbsp;

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:19.840
My husband likes puzzles, my son likes puzzles.&nbsp;
My husband likes building, my son likes building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:30.240
Like father, like son. This wonderful idiom means&nbsp;
the father and son are similar, but it can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:39.280
bad too. For example, if the father says bad&nbsp;
words, the son will say bad words too. Like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:46.960
father, like son. Do you think fathers and&nbsp;
sons are often similar? Let's go shopping.&nbsp;

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.920
Dan:
Can I help you find something?&nbsp;

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.840
Vanessa:
Yes, I'm looking for a warm black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:02.400
coat. The phrase I'm looking for is great to use&nbsp;
when you're shopping. I'm looking for an English&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:11.840
book. I'm looking for moon cakes. I'm looking for&nbsp;
baby diapers. I'm looking for the makeup section.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.160
Can I help you find something? Can you&nbsp;
use I'm looking for in the comments?&nbsp;

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:30.560
Let's talk about buying. I bought this shirt&nbsp;
yesterday. Bought is the past tense of the verb to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:43.760
buy. I am buying this shirt today. Right now, I am&nbsp;
buying. I will buy another shirt tomorrow, in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:55.520
future. I have already bought 10 shirts. I need&nbsp;
to stop buying shirts. What will you buy tomorrow?&nbsp;

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:05.680
Hey, hey, come here. Ssh, ssh, I need to tell&nbsp;
you something. I hate shopping. I really hate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:13.920
shopping, going to the store, the bright lights,&nbsp;
all the people. No. If I need to buy something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:23.600
I shop online. To shop online means you buy it&nbsp;
on the internet. It's so much better for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:38.320
What about you? Do you shop online or in a store?
I want to buy shoes. I wanna buy shoes. Want to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:51.840
wanna. I wanna buy shoes. I am going to&nbsp;
buy shoes. I'm gonna buy shoes. Going to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:52.800 --> 00:31:04.240
gonna. I'm gonna buy shoes. What do you&nbsp;
wanna buy? What are you gonna buy? I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:13.920
bought this dress for $50, but after one week,&nbsp;
look what happened, this dress is a rip-off. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:22.080
rip-off means that the price was high&nbsp;
but the quality was low. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:30.880
the restaurant was very expensive but the food&nbsp;
didn't taste good. The restaurant was a rip-off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:39.280
What a rip-off. Or you can say Vanessa's&nbsp;
lessons are not a rip-off, they're great.&nbsp;

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:51.360
Can you describe a room in English? Walls are the&nbsp;
sides of the room. The ceiling is the top of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:51.360 --> 00:32:02.160
room. The floor is the bottom of the room. There's&nbsp;
an inside door, and I have an outside door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:11.920
The windows in my room have a glass pane. Do&nbsp;
you have any windows in your room? Where do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:20.160
I sit in my living room? I sit on the couch.&nbsp;
Some people call it a sofa, but I say couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:29.040
The couch cushions are on the back of the couch,&nbsp;
the couch pillows are on the side of the couch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:37.440
and the couch legs are on the bottom of the&nbsp;
couch. If your couch is smaller for two people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:46.240
it's called a loveseat. Do you have a couch?
Do you use electronics? Of course. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:56.720
is a charger. The long part is the cord. This&nbsp;
charger has two prongs, but sometimes, there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:06.640
three prongs. This charger also has a&nbsp;
USB port. Where do I put the charger?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:17.120
I put it in an outlet. Do you have a charger?
Let's talk about lights. What is this called?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:25.840
It's a lamp, or table lamp. On&nbsp;
the outside, there is a lampshade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:34.080
and on the inside, there is a light bulb,&nbsp;
or maybe you have a light on the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:45.840
This is a ceiling light. Let's practice&nbsp;
the L pronunciation. The lamp is a light.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:57.200
The lamp is a light. Put your tongue between&nbsp;
your teeth. Say it with me, the lamp is a light.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:04.880
Great work. Do you have a lamp in your room?
Let's talk about the floor. Fun, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:19.920
This is a hardwood floor. This is a carpet, or&nbsp;
a big rug. This is a tile floor. This is a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:28.160
rug. Here is a play mat where my son plays.&nbsp;
What kind of floor do you have in your house?&nbsp;

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:39.520
Let's talk about TV. You can say television,&nbsp;
but TV is much more common. Say it with me, TV,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:51.280
TV. A TV remote, the power button,&nbsp;
the volume button, a TV sound bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:51.280 --> 00:35:01.680
or maybe you have speakers, a TV mount, or&nbsp;
maybe you have a TV console. I never watch TV,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:07.680
but my husband likes to watch hockey&nbsp;
games on the weekend. Do you have a TV?&nbsp;

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:14.560
I like house decorations. These are&nbsp;
paintings. Can you see my husband and I?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:24.640
The painting is in a frame. The frame is&nbsp;
hanging on the wall. These are not paintings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:33.280
they are prints, but they are also in a frame on&nbsp;
the wall. Some decorations on my shelf, these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.880
knick-knacks, little things that I&nbsp;
like to display on a shelf. Pictures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:46.160
these pictures are in picture frames.&nbsp;
Do you have any pictures on your wall?&nbsp;

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:58.160
Let's talk about cars. A compact car, a sedan,&nbsp;
a convertible car, a hatchback, a pickup truck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:10.240
or a pickup, or a truck, a minivan, like I have,&nbsp;
an SUV, a sports car. What kind of car do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:19.280
have? I have a minivan for my family. On the front&nbsp;
of the car, there is the hood. Inside the hood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:29.280
is the engine. Here are the headlights for driving&nbsp;
at night. The tire is here. The inside is the rim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:36.320
On the side of the car is the gas tank. On the&nbsp;
back of the car, there is the trunk. In the trunk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:44.640
you can carry things. There are also brake&nbsp;
lights for stopping, blinkers for turning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:51.760
and a license plate. My license plate is&nbsp;
only on the back of the car. What about you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.080
Do you have a license plate on the&nbsp;
back or on the front of your car?&nbsp;

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:05.760
I use my key to unlock my doors. My key is a&nbsp;
remote, but some cars have a regular key. In some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:14.080
cars, you need to put the key into the ignition.&nbsp;
But in my car, I only need to push a button.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:24.160
After I start the car, I put the car in drive&nbsp;
or in reverse, and hold on to the steering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:33.280
wheel. Is your car key a remote like mine?
I'm sitting in the driver's seat. Here is my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:43.440
headrest. Beside me is the passenger seat. Behind&nbsp;
me is the backseat. Because I have two children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:52.400
I have two car seats in my car. A car seat is&nbsp;
a special seat for a child to keep them safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:59.280
Because my children are small, their car seats&nbsp;
are rear-facing. But when they get older,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.640
their car seats will be front-facing.&nbsp;
Do you have a car seat in your car?&nbsp;

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:14.000
When it rains, you need to turn on the windshield&nbsp;
wipers. When it's hot or cold, you need to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.840
the air vents towards yourself. To check your&nbsp;
speed, you need to look at the speedometer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:29.440
To check your gas level, you need to look&nbsp;
at the gas gauge. When someone is annoying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:37.760
you can honk your horn. Do you honk your horn&nbsp;
often? To see behind you while you're driving, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:46.800
need to look in the rear view mirror. While you&nbsp;
drive, you look through the windshield. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:54.480
roll down your windows to get some fresh air. You&nbsp;
can put down the visor if the sun is too bright.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:02.800
Don't forget to put on your seatbelt. Buckle&nbsp;
up. Do you always wear your seatbelt? I hope so.&nbsp;

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:11.280
Let's talk about the pedals of a car. Before I&nbsp;
drive, I need to take off the emergency parking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:19.520
brake. I push the gas pedal and the brake pedal.&nbsp;
I hit the brakes if somebody stops suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:28.560
in front of me. A manual car will also have&nbsp;
a clutch pedal and a stick shift. My car is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:37.520
an automatic. It has a shifter for park, reverse,&nbsp;
and drive. Do you have a manual or automatic car?&nbsp;

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:46.560
Welcome to my office. This is my home office.&nbsp;
I work from home as your English teacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:58.000
but maybe you work in an office. I usually&nbsp;
sit in an office chair and I sit at the desk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.960
This is the desktop and these are the desk&nbsp;
legs. In my office, I have some office supplies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:18.560
pens, or ballpoint pens, pencils, permanent&nbsp;
markers, whiteboard markers, tape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:32.720
batteries, a notebook with paper, scissors.&nbsp;
Notice the C is silent. Scissors. Say it with me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:42.720
scissors. What office supplies do you have?
Let's talk about electronics in the office. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:53.280
desktop computer, a screen, a keyboard,&nbsp;
a mouse and mousepad, a laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:53.840 --> 00:41:05.040
This is not a notebook. In English, this is a&nbsp;
notebook, a tablet, a smartphone, headphones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:15.520
or earbuds, a microphone, and a webcam.&nbsp;
What electronics do you use in the office?&nbsp;

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:26.320
Excuse me, when you have a minute, can I ask you a&nbsp;
question? Wow, this is super polite. If you speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:32.560
English with your boss or coworkers,&nbsp;
please use this phrase. They will be so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:40.800
amazed because you're so polite. Say it&nbsp;
with me, excuse me, when you have a minute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:50.960
can I ask you a question? Great job.
One child, two children. One woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:51.920 --> 00:42:10.240
two women. One man, two men. One foot, two feet.&nbsp;
One tooth, two teeth. One half, two halves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:25.440
One wife, two wives. Hmm. One knife, two&nbsp;
knives. One fish, two fish. One mouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

RSVP by October 30th. ASAP, as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

time of arrival. My ETA at your house is 5:30 PM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:22.400
VS, versus. Coffee versus tea, tea is the best.
Let's talk about food. Fruit, fruit, vegetables,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:36.560
vegetables. Sometimes, we say veggies.&nbsp;
Meat, meat, fish, fish, grains, grains,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:51.280
dairy, dairy, dessert. I like dessert. Drinks,&nbsp;
drinks. What food do you like? Cookies are sweet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:04.000
Chips are salty. Lemons are sour.&nbsp;
Coffee is bitter. Peppers are spicy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.680
Fish is oily. Beans are healthy. And ice cream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:22.320
is unhealthy. Do you like ice cream? Do&nbsp;
you know these vegetable names in English?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:38.560
Cabbage, bok choi, potatoes, cucumber,&nbsp;
celery, green onions, garlic, ginger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:49.840
radish, eggplant, bean sprouts, mushrooms.&nbsp;
Which vegetable is your favorite?&nbsp;

00:44:50.720 --> 00:45:00.160
Do you know how to say these fruits in&nbsp;
English? Apple, peach, pear, kumquat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:14.160
mandarin, orange, starfruit, mango,&nbsp;
banana, strawberry, mulberry, jackfruit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:27.440
lychee, dragon fruit, dates, durian. Which&nbsp;
fruit is your favorite? A bag of chips,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:45.840
a box of tea, a can of pumpkin, a jar of&nbsp;
jam, a package of noodles, a bottle of oil,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:01.520
a slice or piece of bread.
How did you enjoy all of those quick, rapid-fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:07.280
English lessons? I hope that you enjoyed it. I&nbsp;
asked a lot of questions during these lessons. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:13.120
the end of every little clip, I asked a question,&nbsp;
so my challenge for you is can you answer one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.560
these questions in the comments? Let's read each&nbsp;
other's comments and just get to know more about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.440
each other, and also, practice English. Well,&nbsp;
