Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:06.580
Are you ready to relax when you speak English?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.660
I hope so.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.710
Let's talk about it.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.590
Today I'm on the beach, and it's very sunny,
very hot even though it's seven o'clock in

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.590
the morning.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.780
Costa Rica, it's beautiful, and what better
place to relax than at the beach, right?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.010
But you can't always be at the beach when
you're speaking English.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.040
So today, I want to give you my top tip for
helping you to relax, de-stress and feel comfortable

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.540
when you're speaking English.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.840
I know that a lot of you use English for your
job.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.560
Maybe you need to speak in English with a
foreign company, or maybe you need to speak

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.170
with your clients that are from other countries.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.320
This is a pretty stressful situation because
number one, you want to be polite, you want

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.320
to represent your company well.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.090
But also you want to represent yourself well.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.690
You want to be confident, be an adult who
can express yourself completely.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.380
So when you speak in a business situation,
I would consider this the top maybe most stressful

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.350
situation in English.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.140
What about another level down from that?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.700
Maybe you're walking around New York City
on your vacation, and you get lost, or you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.060
want to find a good restaurant, so you want
to ask for a recommendation, and you decide

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.020
to approach a stranger.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.870
You want to talk with a native English speaker.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.030
Well, this is also can be pretty stressful,
but it's a little bit less stressful than

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.740
a business situation because you're not going
to lose your job.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010
What if you go to an English class in your
city?

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.700
You're surrounded by other people who are
also learning English.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.030
This is slightly different than approaching
someone in New York or having a business meeting

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.189
because they understand exactly the situation
that you're in.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.720
They understand exactly that kind of nervousness,
that kind of stress or fear about speaking

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.830
another language because that's what they're
doing too.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.310
They are also English learners.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.400
What about if you're just at home watching
this lesson, and you're repeating it out loud?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.220
You're maybe watching the subtitles, which
you can always click on on YouTube.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.929
You're watching the subtitles, and you're
trying to repeat out loud after me.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.069
No one's listening, you're just at home by
yourself, but you still need courage to be

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.239
able to use your voice, to use your pronunciation
muscles and speak out loud and hear your own

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.670
voice in English.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.560
This is I think, the least stressful situation
and this is my tip.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.670
This is where I recommend starting.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.220
If you feel super stressed about speaking
English, start at the easiest level and this

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.030
is by yourself.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.370
No one else is listening.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.889
No one else is watching you.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.489
Just by yourself at home.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.269
You can shadow or repeat directly after me
in these videos, you can look at the subtitles

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.340
below the screen if you're on the computer.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.359
You can just click CC in the bottom corner
or if you're on your phone you can click those

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.819
three little dots at the top of the screen,
and you'll see the subtitles.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.079
You could just repeat out loud after me and
get used to hearing your own voice using English.

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.459
I know for me when I visited other foreign
countries, like in Costa Rica here, they speak

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.769
Spanish.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.900
I feel a little bit strange at first hearing
my own voice trying to say something in another

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.420
language and maybe you felt that feeling too.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.659
So when you get used to hearing your own voice
using English, you'll start to feel a little

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.349
more comfortable and then you'll be able to
work up to the next level.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.349
After you've mastered speaking with yourself
alone, no one's watching.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.579
Then you can go to that next level, which
is speaking with other people who really get

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.799
and understand how you're feeling.

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.139
Maybe other English learners are here on YouTube,
or I know a lot of you who are part of my

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.719
course, the Fearless Fluency Club, a lot of
you speak together on Skype.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.099
You connect with each other daily, maybe on
WhatsApp, on Skype on Google Hangouts and

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.109
just try to connect, get to know other cultures,
other people, but also you can get over your

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.079
fear of speaking together because you're both
in the same boat.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.199
This is a wonderful idiom that means you're
both in the same situation.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.989
That involves maybe a little bit of risk,
a little bit of stress.

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.540
You're both in that situation, and you can
both understand each other.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.680
So speaking with another English learner is
a great next step up to help build your confidence.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.809
After you've mastered speaking with yourself.

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:14.839
You've done that for a little while.

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:16.380
You feel more and more comfortable.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.650
You've spoken with another English learner,
now it's time to speak with a native speaker.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.650
Hmm.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.650
This could be really anyone.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.650
It could be a teacher.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.790
It could be someone who lives in your city,
who you trust, maybe a co-worker who is from

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.340
the US and you want to just have some coffee
together and chat together.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.080
You already have a little relationship.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.490
You already know each other and trust each
other.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.900
Or maybe you just go to another city, like
you go to London and you want to order in

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.930
a restaurant.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.680
Maybe you can watch my video about how to
order in a restaurant up here.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.590
You'll be able to just feel a little more
comfortable because you've already worked

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.680
those steps starting small than working more
and more and more, and now you're speaking

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.850
with a native speaker.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.300
Personally, I think something really magical
happens when you speak with a native English

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.250
speaker, and they can understand you, you
can understand them, and you just have a real

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.340
conversation.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.780
Something happens that is amazingly magical
for your confidence.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.620
When you realize, "Vanessa can understand
me?

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.670
This other native speaker can understand me,
and I'm communicating?

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.310
This is amazing."

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.060
You have this beautiful boost of confidence,
and it really helps you to just increase your

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.880
English in every other way.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.820
What do you think happens next after you've
spoken with yourself, you've built your confidence,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.740
you've spoken with other English learners,
you've built your confidence and then you've

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.230
spoken with native speakers in a kind of casual
situation?

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.060
Now, it's time to move on and speak at your
job.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.640
Maybe you have a presentation.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.110
Maybe you have to make phone calls with some
other clients in other countries.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.270
You've really prepared yourself well.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.240
You've started small, and you built up to
this most stressful situation.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.530
It might still be a little stressful, but
it's going to be way better than if you just

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.900
started with that, and you didn't prepare
little by little along the way.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.400
When you do this, you're building your confidence,
and you're really giving a gift to yourself

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.250
that, "I will grow.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.580
I will improve, and I can do it.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.070
I can relax, I can de-stress."

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.670
You don't need to be at the beach.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.670
You don't need to have the waves and the sounds
and the trees and the monkeys behind you.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.940
You just need to really build your confidence
day-by-day by starting small.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.111
And now I have a question for you.

00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:29.330
Have you ever spoken English with a native
English speaker?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.330
How did you feel?

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.740
What was that experience like for you?

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.890
If it was a positive experience, congratulations.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.670
If you felt really stressed, really worried,
just take it back a little bit.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.780
Start small.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.000
Start with these steps I'm talking about;
shadowing my videos, speaking and repeating

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.700
after me, then working up with another English
learner, and then with a native English speaker,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.680
and then if you need to use it for your job,
you will be well prepared at that point.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.920
Before we go today, we're going to see some
beautiful scenery of the beach.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.030
You're going to see the waves rolling in,
and we're going to repeat an important phrase.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.540
I want you to repeat it with me.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.330
This is starting at the base level, repeating
and shadowing by yourself.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:17.060
I want you to say this phrase with me, and
I hope that it will help to build your confidence.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.340
The waves are beautiful, aren't they?

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.920
I want you to repeat this sentence with me.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.070
Just imagine the waves.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.490
Take a deep breath.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.639
Let's say it together.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:33.280
"I can speak English confidently without stress.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.690
I can speak English confidently without stress.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.310
I can speak English confidently without stress.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.530
I can speak English confidently without stress."

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.530
You can do it.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.180
Thanks so much for learning English with me,
and I'll see you next Friday for a new lesson

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.360
here on my YouTube channel, bye.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:06.720
Why did I choose a spot where I'm staring
directly into the sun?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.000
Ah, whoo, it's hot.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.980
Can 
you guys see how much I'm sweating right now?

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.800
I hope you don't see my skin burning as we
speak.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.210
There're monkeys in there somewhere.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.230
They stole my snack yesterday.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.990
Hope they enjoyed it.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:34.020
I guess there's jaguars there too, so it's
got to be safe.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:40.269
The next step is to download my free e-book,
Five Steps to Becoming a Confident English

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:41.449
Speaker.

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:45.490
You'll learn what you need to do to speak
confidently and fluently.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.230

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.230

Bye.
