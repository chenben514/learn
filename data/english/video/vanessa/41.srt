00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:04.560
Hello, hello.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.750
Welcome to today's live English lesson here
on the Speak English with Vanessa YouTube

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.750
Channel.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.530
I'm so glad that you're taking time out of
your day to improve your English.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.850
Today, I hope that you will improve your listening
skills and especially listening to fast English

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.950
speakers.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.090
A lot of my students have told me that they
can understand me, but they can't understand

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.870
TV shows or movies or other native speaker
friends, because they talk really fast, so

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.470
today I'm going teach you a technique that
will help you to understand native English

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.870
speakers and also improve the skills step-by-step
every day.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.410
Today, first we're going to talk about how
can you understand fast speakers, then we're

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.809
going to practice this technique together,
and then at the end, I'm going to help you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.010
continue this style for the month of June
in the 30 Day English Listening Challenge.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.790
We did this listening challenge in January
of 2018 with a big success.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
A lot of you really enjoyed this challenge
every day, improving your listening skills,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.110
so we're doing it again for the month of June.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.140
At the end of this lesson, I'll give you some
more details, but if you would like to know

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.850
now, you can click the link in the description
to learn more about the 30 Day English Listening

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.960
Challenge Pack Two.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.340
How can you understand native English speakers?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.340
Is there a trick?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.490
I know a lot of people think that if they
just listen a lot, if you watch Star Wars

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.680
five million times, eventually you'll understand
what they're saying.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.659
But if you have ever tried to watch an English
TV show, if you've ever tried to watch Breaking

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.680
Bad, or Game of Thrones, or an older show
like Friends, and you understood hardly anything,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.649
you probably felt a little bit overwhelmed
or frustrated because there's a lot of vocabulary,

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.039
a lot of expressions, and a lot of reductions
in pronunciation.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.620
A lot of different things that you're not
used to hearing on a daily basis, so can you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.109
really just watch these things millions of
times to understand?

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.049
Maybe you could, but it's not the most efficient
method.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.519
If you hardly understand anything of what
you're listening to, you need to take a step

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.099
back, and use the technique that we're going
to talk about today.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.209
And that technique is going to be analyzing
short real conversations.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.749
When you take a real conversation, not one
of my videos ... My videos are teaching English.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.959
I'm speaking to English learners.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.079
But when you watch and listen to real English
conversations, you're going to hear the natural

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.450
reductions, the natural vocabulary, the natural
linking styles.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.549
When you take short clips from conversations
like that, and analyze it, listen to it, again

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.890
and again and again, you'll start to realize,
"Oh, maybe I can understand this short segment.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.750
I know which sounds are difficult for me,
which sounds are easy for me.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.439
Maybe which ones are different from my native
language."

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:29.599
Analyzing those short clips, that is a key
to understanding long TV shows, understanding

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.969
your co-workers when they speak in a business
meeting, understanding when you call your

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.269
hotel in Florida when you're going to Disney
World.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.169
You need to understand the receptionist on
the phone, but she's probably going to speak

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.169
fast.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.829
This is a key to help you take your listening
skills to the next level.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.159
Analyzing those short segments.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.870
Of course, you can listen to Star Wars five
million times.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.319
It's possible.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.279
But if you want to be more efficient and understand
multiple English speakers, this is the technique

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.489
that we're going to practice today.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.479
If you're joining me live for this lesson,
I want to thank you.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.359
Thank you from Taiwan, Korea, Paraguay, Brazil.

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.230
Thank you so much.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.170
If you are watching the replay, no problem.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.580
We're going to be practicing this technique
of analyzing short real conversations today.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.710
Make sure that you have a pen, some paper,
and be prepared to be active during this lesson,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.760
because it's good to passively listen, but
when you're active, that's when your brain

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.800
makes those connections that it needs to really
remember these things in the future when you're

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.789
using it in the real world.

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.770
Take your pen, take your pencil, we're going
to be analyzing a clip.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.770
Let's go to the second section, and I'm going
to tell you what we're going to be listening

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.770
to.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.500
We're going to be doing four things.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.070
The first thing is, we're going to listen
to a fast clip.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.460
This is a quick conversation that I had with
my mother-in-law.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.670
She is American.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.650
She is a native English speaker.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.840
She speaks quickly.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.639
She uses natural pronunciation.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.420
All native English speakers are able to understand
her.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.189
But maybe for you, she speaks in a different
way than you're used to, or she speaks faster.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.370
She speaks like you're used to hearing in
TV shows.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.180
But it's a little fast, so the second thing
we're going to do is we're going to listen

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.469
to a slow version.

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:45.189
This slow version is actually going to be
the same exact conversation, but it's going

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.280
to be reduced.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.449
It's going to be slowed down to a kind of
unnatural speed.

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:05.800
You might think that it's not helpful to listen
to unnatural slow conversations, but when

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.240
you hear the fast version, and then you hear
the slow version, it is going to be key.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.710
It is going to be the key to your success
because you're going to hear every single

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:26.050
word and when you listen to the fast version
again, you'll realize, "Oh, I do understand

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.050
everything."

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.919
The second thing we're going to do is listen
to that slow version, and then we're going

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.690
to check your writing.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.509
I guess the third thing is to write.

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.560
The third thing is to write exactly what you
hear.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.680
I want you to use your pen, use your pencil.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.949
You can write it on your phone, but there's
some studies that show when you physically

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.889
write something, you remember it better.

00:06:51.889 --> 00:07:02.439
I recommend writing exactly what you hear,
and trying to imitate exactly that same speaking

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:03.439
style.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:09.210
When you hear some words that maybe you don't
know, just try to write it down, and we'll

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.009
listen to the fast version a couple of times,
and then we'll go back and listen to the slow

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.499
version.

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:20.900
When you listen to the slow version, this
is your chance to pick up on any words that

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.190
you didn't understand in the fast version.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:29.080
"Pick up on" is a great phrasal verb that
just means, "Oh, I can hear those.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.060
I can understand it.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.199
I can understand those little segments."

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.020
When you listen to the slow version, you'll
be able to pick up on those little details

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.300
that you might have missed in the fast version.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:50.199
And when you finish writing, the fourth step
is to compare your writing with the original

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.240
transcript.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:58.930
What did Margie, who's my mother-in-law, what
did Margie actually say in that conversation?

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:04.860
And when you can compare her speaking to what
you wrote, then you'll realize, "Aha!

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.500
This is word is always difficult for me.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.930
Why can't I hear it?"

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.190
Or maybe you'll realize, "Oh, that's what
it sounds like in a real conversation."

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.130
When it's reduced, when it's linked together,
"Aha.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.930
Now I can understand it."

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.139
And in the 30 Day Listening Challenge, you're
going to have these four things: The fast

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:26.849
version, the slow version, you're going to
write.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.639
I'm going to give you a worksheet so that
you can write, and then a transcript so that

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.650
you can check your writing every day.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.329
A lot of my students in the first listening
challenge in January, they said that the first

00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:40.190
couple days were pretty tough.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.320
It was fast.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.930
It was a new technique, a new strategy for
them, but on the second week they noticed

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.720
a huge improvement.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.670
All of a sudden, their ears were getting used
to hearing and they felt more comfortable.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.500
And by the third week, the fourth week, it
just got better and better.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.720
This is your first lesson.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.870
This is kind of a practice technique, so if
you feel like it's too fast, "Oh, I can't

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:09.490
do it", be patient with yourself, try to do
this lesson a couple of times when it's finished,

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.959
and then if you would like to join the 30
Day English Listening Challenge, this is the

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:17.920
week when it's open, May 25th to May 31st.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.440
You'll be able to continue to use this technique
over the month of June and you can continue

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.709
improving your listening skills.

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:30.110
If it is after the month of June, or after
May when you're watching this, you can just

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.029
click on the link and see when the challenge
will open again.

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:37.620
All right, what we're going to do now is,
I'm going to share my screen and I'm going

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.120
to show you the writing style that you can
have.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.769
I would like to show you exactly the kind
of thing that you're going to see.

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:59.019
All right, here on my screen you can see 30
Day English Listening Challenge 2.

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:04.440
Here is the conversation outline that you're
going to see.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.860
First, Margie is going to say something, then
I'm going to say something, then Margie, Vanessa,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.880
Margie, Vanessa.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.830
If you have a piece of paper right now, I
recommend writing at least M, V, M, V, M,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.790
V. Try to write this so that you can, at least,
prepare yourself for what you're going to

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.790
hear.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:31.860
This is actually day 16 of the Listening Challenge
that is open right now for $30.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.930
This is day 16.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.920
On June 16th, you'll have this conversation,
but I wanted to give it to you as a free sample.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.870
You'll see here, in this conversation, Margie
describes her decision to home-school her

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.070
children.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.180
This is a quick little summary of what you're
going to hear.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.100
It's only going to be a couple seconds, maybe
30, 40 seconds, so we're going to listen to

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.449
the fast version a couple times.

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.459
All right.

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:03.230
Are you ready to listen to the fast version?

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.589
Let's listen to the fast version a couple
times.

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:11.070
I'm going to show it to you, or let you listen
to it three times.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.639
You're going to hear the conversation, but
you're not going to see any words.

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:19.880
You're only going to see my face, so this
is really going to test your listening skills.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:26.740
I'm going to turn off my microphone and I
want you to listen to this original fast audio

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.149
version.

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:29.149
Are you ready?

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:31.620
We're going to listen to it three times.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.779
Okay.

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:34.040
Let's listen.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.490
Margie: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.550
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.850
Margie: Not the norm, yeah.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.860
Vanessa: That's kind of typical of the US,
though, that people do do things differently.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.860
Margie: Yeah.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.390
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:59.100
Margie: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.160
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.399
Margie: Not the norm, yeah.

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:05.470
Vanessa: That's kind of typical of the US,
though, that people do do things differently.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.470
Margie: Yeah.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.370
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:17.450
Margie: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.510
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.790
Margie: Not the norm, yeah.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.819
Vanessa: That's kind of typical of the US,
though, that people do do things differently.

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:24.819
Margie: Yeah.

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:28.600
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.319
Okay.

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:35.430
Thank you for your patience the first time.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.540
The sound wasn't on, but the second time it
was.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.639
I hope that you got a chance to listen to
that clip three times.

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:44.680
It was pretty quick.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:51.009
Margie mentioned that she home-schooled her
children.

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:53.519
Let's listen to the slow version.

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:59.200
I want you to hear every single word slowly.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.750
This version is not with Margie, it's with
me and Dan, my husband.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.600
We're reading it really slowly.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:15.959
I hope that it will be easier for you to understand,
but if you have your pen, make sure that you're

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:18.199
writing down everything you hear.

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:20.010
All right, are you ready?

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.240
I'm going to turn over my microphone.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.089
I'm going to turn it off, and I want you to
hear the speakers, so that you can check out

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:31.490
exactly what you're listening to.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.610
Okay, let's listen.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.449
Day 16.

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:37.870
Typical.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:44.870
Dan: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.370
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.920
Dan: Not the norm.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:54.949
That's kind of typical of the US though, that
people do do things differently.

00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:55.949
Dan: Yeah.

00:13:55.949 --> 00:14:00.019
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:03.470
Day 16.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.190
Typical.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:12.529
Dan: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:14.000
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.540
Dan: Not the norm.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.540
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:22.600
That's kind of typical of the US though, that
people do do things differently.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
Dan: Yeah.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.540
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.730
Day 16.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.329
Typical.

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:39.509
Dan: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:41.000
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.420
Dan: Not the norm.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.480
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:49.600
That's kind of typical of the US though, that
people do do things differently.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600
Dan: Yeah.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.000
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.120
All right.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.279
We listened to the fast version three times,
actually six times, but the first three times

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:07.279
didn't work.

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.370
It's okay.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.550
Then the slow version three times.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:16.220
You heard Dan say what Margie was saying,
and I was saying what I was saying, but also

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.970
slower.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.569
Did you think that the slow version was easier
for you to understand?

00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:29.510
If you heard that fast version, and you felt,
"This is too fast", that's probably also how

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:35.550
you feel when you watch English TV shows or
movies, maybe when you talk on the phone with

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.160
a business client.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.069
That same feeling of, "I can't understand
the majority of what they're saying", or,

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:45.029
"I don't understand these little expressions."

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:50.449
Well, when you're listening to the slow version,
you're going to be able to pick up on those

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:54.330
little details, and it's going to help you
build your fluency and build your listening

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.449
skills.

00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:57.370
Let's go to step number four.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:01.740
I hope that you were writing what you were
listening to, or at least listening closely.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.970
We're going to take a look at the worksheet.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.490
Actually, the transcript.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.279
I'm going to show you the transcript.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.009
We're going to go over the transcript.

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:14.040
I'm going to explain three vocabulary words,
because every day in the 30 Day Listening

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:20.540
Challenge, there are three vocabulary expressions
that I'll tell you more about from each clip.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.649
Let's take a look at the transcript.

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:24.649
I'm going to share my screen again.

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:30.310
And we're going to look at exactly what was
said.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.019
All right.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:41.839
Here, you can see 30 Day English Listening
Challenge 2, The Transcripts.

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:46.160
Does this look familiar?

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.350
You saw on the worksheet Margie, Vanessa,
Margie, Vanessa, Margie, Vanessa.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:56.920
And here we have exactly the what we said,
so I hope that as you were writing, your paper

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.040
looks similar to this.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.800
And then, at the bottom, we have vocabulary
expressions.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.850
Let's talk about these in just a moment.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.180
But first, I'd like to go over the transcript.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.820
I'm going to read this slowly, and after we
finish talking about the transcript, we're

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:17.320
going to go back and listen to the fast version
a couple times so you can see, "Oh, I do understand

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.430
more, and I do know what this means."

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:26.530
In the beginning, Margie said, "I home-schooled
my children, and that was a big thing way

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.600
back when."

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.590
I'll explain that expression in just a moment.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.540
Then I said, "Not the norm."

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.670
And Margie repeats, "Not the norm."

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:42.870
I said, "Yeah, that's kind of typical of the
US, though, that people do do things differently."

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.340
Margie agrees, she says, "Yeah."

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.600
And I said, "Not everyone follows the same
pattern."

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.670
All right.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.140
I hope that you heard something similar to
this, at least in the slow version.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.550
Let's talk about these three vocabulary expression,
because they're essential for understanding

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.510
the meaning of this short clip.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:08.020
Margie says, "Home-schooling was a big thing
way back when."

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.520
This expression "way back when" is super common.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:18.010
We say this all the time to talk about an
undefined time a long time ago.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.690
You're not saying 10 years ago.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:21.860
That's specific.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.870
Way back when is a general time a long time
ago.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:34.790
Maybe you might say, "Way back when, women
didn't wear pants, they wore skirts or dresses."

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:40.550
This is not a specific time, but it's just
a general time a long time ago.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.680
She said, "I home-schooled my children.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.680
That was a big thing."

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.240
That means it wasn't common.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:51.850
It was unusual way back when, so 20 years
ago when her children were younger.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.400
I kind of repeated the idea.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.390
"Not the norm."

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.430
The norm.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:02.570
I made a video on YouTube several years ago
about the expression "the norm".

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.800
And this means normal.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.210
It's not normal.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.190
That wasn't normal.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:13.070
We can say, casually, "Oh, that's not the
norm", or, "It is the norm."

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:19.410
You might say, "In my country, it is the norm
to eat dinner late.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.770
We eat dinner at 8:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.810
It's the norm to eat dinner late."

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.660
Let me know, what is something that is the
norm in your country?

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.290
That's the second vocabulary expression that
we talk about down here.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:39.520
And finally, why in the world did I say, "People
do do things differently"?

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.500
Why did I repeat do twice?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.740
Well, this is another thing that I made a
YouTube video about quite a long time ago.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.610
We often use do as emphasis.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.740
If you said to me, "Vanessa, you don't like
cats?"

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:03.320
Well, I like cats, so I could respond, "I
do like cats."

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.180
I'm adding do before the verb.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.870
And here, the verb happens to be do.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:16.550
That's why it seems a little strange that
they're together, because we could say, "People

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.650
do things differently."

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.930
But instead, I decided to emphasize what I
was saying.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.910
"Oh, people do do things differently."

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.650
You might add do in front of something else
that is emphasized.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.890
All right, so those are the three vocabulary
words here.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:40.280
I'm going to go back to my video for just
a moment.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.170
Before we take a look at the fast version
and then take a look at the transcript so

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:50.930
you can read them and listen at the same time,
I want to let you know that every day for

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.160
the 30 Day English Listening Challenge, you're
going to get three new vocabulary expressions

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.090
like this included in the transcript.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.620
Because, yes it's good to improve your listening
skills, but you need to know what they're

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.180
saying too.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.200
Maybe you can understand, you can hear each
word, but can you understand it?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.520
Can you use those expressions yourself?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.710
Well, that's what the vocabulary is for.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:18.650
And because it's such a short clip, I hope
that it will help you to repeat it a lot of

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.540
times, to be able to engrain it in your memory.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.540
Okay.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540
Let's look at the transcript.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:32.230
I'm going to share my screen and we're also
going to listen to the fast version a couple

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.230
times.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.720
I want you to follow along with your eyes,
check your paper that you were writing on,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.040
and make sure that you wrote it accurately.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.320
And if you didn't write something accurately,
circle it.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:51.850
Go back and decide, "Oh, every time that she
said and, I wrote an.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.500
I didn't add a D. I couldn't hear that sound."

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.780
You know, for you, that's a difficult thing
to hear.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:05.140
Make sure that you go back and analyze your
own difficulties with that.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.800
Let's go ahead and listen to the fast version
together.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.120
All right, I'm going to play it here and share
my screen.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:24.530
Let's do that.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:33.160
Margie: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.230
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.530
Margie: Not the norm, yeah.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.540
Vanessa: That's kind of typical of the US,
though, that people do do things differently.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.540
Margie: Yeah.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.100
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:50.850
Margie: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:51.910
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.190
Margie: Not the norm, yeah.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:57.220
Vanessa: That's kind of typical of the US,
though, that people do do things differently.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.220
Margie: Yeah.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.180
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:07.340
Margie: I home-schooled my children, and that
was a big thing way back when.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.400
Vanessa: Not the norm?

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.680
Margie: Not the norm, yeah.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.710
Vanessa: That's kind of typical of the US,
though, that people do do things differently.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.710
Margie: Yeah.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.970
Vanessa: Not everyone follows the same pattern.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:25.360
All right.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.470
How did you do?

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:32.790
As you saw the transcript, and you listened
to the fast version, did you hear more than

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.830
you heard the first time?

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:39.130
Because we listened to the slow version, we
talked about that vocabulary a little bit,

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:46.910
I hope that you could understand more and
it was useful for you to take that first step

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.700
in improving your listening skills.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:56.760
Imagine if you studied like this for five
to 10 minutes every day for 30 days.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.790
Your listening skills would skyrocket.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.100
Skyrocket means improve a lot.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.500
And this is exactly what other people who
joined the course in January told me.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.770
They said that during the month some lessons
were more difficult, some lessons were more

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:18.050
easy, but by the end of the month, they felt
like they had analyzed and listened to these

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:23.760
short, real clips so many times, and really
dedicated themselves for 30 days so their

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.770
listening fluency improved, and the most important
thing is, feeling like you can continue that

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.550
and use it in the real world.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.840
It's great to understand the lessons and that
short little clips, but can you take it into

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.240
the real world?

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.990
And yes, you definitely can.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.630
That's something that you need to do no matter
where you are.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.930
If you're using English, you're going to hear
it, so improving your listening skills is

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.030
really important.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:52.970
I'm going to show you, as we continue ... If
this lesson was useful to you, I hope that

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.790
you can join me to learn like this for 30
days.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:02.670
The 30 Day Listening Challenge Pack Two is
open right now.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:09.520
Yesterday was the first day to join, so you
only have one week to join the 30 Day Listening

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.990
Challenge for $30.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:16.710
Next time that it opens, it's going to be
a higher price and the enrollment will close

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:23.110
in one week, so make sure that you join before
June 1st, because on June 1st, I'm going to

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.490
send you the first lesson.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.380
Today, we studied the ... Which one was it?

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.580
The 16th lesson.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:37.710
And you're going to be able to study Day one,
two, three, four, all the way up until 30.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:44.620
I'm going to take a moment to share my screen
and show you exactly what you're going to

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.130
be learning in the course.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.130
All right.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:52.290
Let's take a moment to take a look at my screen.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.480
There's a lot going on right here, isn't there?

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:04.330
I'd like to show you the 30 Day English Listening
Challenge Pack Two course material.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.710
Here, you're going to have access immediately
to day zero.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.710
Today is day zero.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.940
Any day before the course starts on June 1st
is day zero.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:20.580
Let's take a look at the day zero material.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.770
Welcome to the 30 Day English Listening Challenge.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.900
You're going to find a course guide, which
is here.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.350
This is the course guide.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:33.360
A course calendar so that you can track your
progress, and also a zip file.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.180
I know some students want to download all
of the courses on the first day, so they don't

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.280
have to keep going online to view them.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280
No problem.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.380
Or you can just view them every day.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.830
In the course guide, I give you a recommended
study guide.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.020
But I'm going to give you a little tip.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.240
This is exactly what we did today.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.651
You're going to be able to download the files,
print the worksheet and the transcript, listen

00:26:56.651 --> 00:27:02.550
to the original conversation clip two or three
times, like we did today, then you can write

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:07.460
exactly what you hear, listen to the slow
version, which is what we did, as well, and

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.280
then check your writing with the original
transcript, which we did.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:17.320
You're welcome to also write expressions and
sentences using the special vocabulary words

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.320
every day.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.180
That's kind of a bonus material.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.460
You also get a calendar for the month of June.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.770
On June 1st, I'm going to send you the first
lesson.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:34.830
We studied this day 16 lesson over here, but
you're going to have access to all of these

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.880
lessons throughout the month of June.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.440
And each day you'll have access to a new lesson.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.870
Right now, these are not available because
June hasn't started yet, but on the first

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.820
day you'll have access to day one, the empty-nesters
lesson.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:28:00.100
Day two, you'll have access to the free-for-all
lesson, etc, throughout the rest of the month.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.970
If you enjoyed today's lesson, but you just
want some more details, no problem.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:09.510
Let's take a look at the page that is linked
in the description below this video.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:15.890
If you go to SpeakEngliswithVanessa.com, which
is my website, /listeningchallenge2, or you

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.780
can click the link in the description, you'll
see this page.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:25.020
At the moment that we are making this live
lesson, there are six days, 10 hours, 26 minutes,

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.750
53, 52, 51 seconds left to join the course.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:35.920
The enrollment closes on May 31st, so make
sure that you join before June 1st when the

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.730
first lesson comes out.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.960
If you would like to learn more about the
course, I recommend taking a look at this

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.960
page.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.290
You can see another sample conversation.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.140
This is a sample from day one.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.800
You can listen to it.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.350
Listen to the fast one, the slow one, see
the worksheet, the transcript, and you'll

00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:00.690
also see some of the bonuses; these 90 expressions,
the calendar, and at the end of the month,

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:06.980
I'll send you a special unofficial certificate
of completion with your name on it.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.020
And it is only $30.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:15.660
If you would like to join the course now,
it is your best deal because later, if I decide

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:20.750
to open this course again, for Pack Two it
will be a higher price.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:27.470
At the moment, Pack One is $47, but if you
want to get both of them together, you can

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.690
get it for $60.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:33.230
This is special promotion with both packs,
but you can get just Pack Two.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:38.370
It's the same level, same style material,
but just different lessons.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.560
You can get either one.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.330
Pack One could start today if you want, or
you can have access to these lessons forever.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.830
There's no rush.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:53.000
I recommend studying them with us on June
1st, but you have access to it forever, so

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.740
if you go on vacation for a week, don't worry.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.240
You can always come back.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.750
There's also some frequently asked questions.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.810
"Can I download the lessons?"

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.800
Yes, you can download them and keep them forever.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.010
"What's the price of the challenge?"

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.600
$30, or one dollar a day.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.070
"When will I get the first lesson?"

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.200
June 1st.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.200
Excellent.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.310
"What level is this?

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.710
What's the refund policy?

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.140
How should I use the course?"

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:23.780
You can check out all of these questions in
the link in the description below, or you're

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.540
welcome to send me an email, as well.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.540
All right.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:33.690
I hope today's lesson was useful for you,
and that you could see this technique that

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.230
will help you to improve your listening skills.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:40.810
If today was pretty short for you, you'd like
to go back, no problem.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:45.750
You can repeat this lesson as many times as
you would like, and in the 30 Day Listening

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.790
Challenge, I recommend five to 10 minutes
every day.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:53.150
Five to 10 minutes maybe after breakfast or
before you go to bed.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.520
Repeat the short clip a couple times.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.100
Repeat it five times, 10 times, three times.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.100
It's your choice.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.680
And try to write exactly what it is.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.220
It should be really short, so that you can
complete it successfully every day.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.220
That's the goal.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.150
The goal is to be able to complete it, because
at the end of the month, you'll really see

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.820
that your progress and your hard work paid
off.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.461
Thank you so much for joining me today.

00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:20.500
If you would like to join the 30 Day English
Listening Challenge Pack Two, there's a link

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.730
in the description, and then I'll post a link
here at the end of this video.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.230
Thanks so much for joining me.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.820
I hope you have a wonderful week, and I'll
see you again the next time.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.370
Bye.
