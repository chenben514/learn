message. For me, I don't like notifications, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:24.560
it is necessary and polite to tip. Tipping means&nbsp;

give to your server. This is necessary in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:46.320
If you do not tip, you are very rude. So please&nbsp;
give a tip when you go to a restaurant in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Thank you. I'll be right back.
Vanessa:&nbsp;

You should stay sitting at the table. In America,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:27.920
usually each person only pays for one meal.&nbsp;
We do not fight about the check. Who pays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:36.080
when you go to a restaurant? Important&nbsp;
notice. In America, we do not share food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:42.160

food to share before the meal. The main course is&nbsp;
a larger plate for one person and only one person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:15.360
We never share the main course. Do you share the&nbsp;
main course in your country? These are snacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can you say it with me? Snacks? I eat snacks&nbsp;

them when I cook. I often use salt, pepper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:16.160
garlic powder, paprika, and cinnamon. What spices&nbsp;
do you use? These are dry goods. Dry goods don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:25.600
need to go in the refrigerator, they can stay&nbsp;
in your room. I keep my dry goods in a cupboard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:32.880
but you can keep your dry goods on a shelf&nbsp;
too. Where do you keep your dry goods?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:43.600
Do you plan what you will eat? This is&nbsp;
called a meal plan. A meal plan. I plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:53.600
two weeks of meals. This helps me to save&nbsp;
money and be organized and save time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:02.640
This is my meal plan. Do you make a meal&nbsp;
plan? What's this in English? You can put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:12.640

are Tupperware containers. Can you say it with me?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:20.480
Tupperware containers. Tupperware&nbsp;
containers are very useful for storing food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:31.840
There is fresh fruit in the fruit tray. In&nbsp;
the fruit tray. It's not in the refrigerator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:41.360
it's not in the freezer, the fresh fruit is in a&nbsp;
fruit tray. Where do you keep your fresh fruits?&nbsp;

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:49.200
How did you enjoy all of these quick, rapid fire&nbsp;
English lessons? I hope it was helpful for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:55.760
And at the end of a lot of these lessons, I asked&nbsp;
a question. So my challenge for you is to answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.800
one of the questions that you heard in this&nbsp;
lesson. Use the English that you learned, write&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.160
it in the comments, and I can't wait to see what&nbsp;
