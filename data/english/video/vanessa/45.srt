Hello, hello.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.230
Welcome to this live English lesson here on
this Speak English with Vanessa YouTube channel.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.290
I'm so glad that you're taking time today
to improve your English at the end of 2017.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.279
I hope that you'll make some resolutions to
continue to improve your English in the New

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.160
Year, 2018.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.100
Today we're gonna talk about the great way
to understand fast English.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.530
Today we're gonna practice it.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.969
I'm gonna talk about how to do it.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.670
Then we're gonna practice it.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.329
And then you'll have a chance to continue
to use this style in 2018, and join the 30

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.590
Day Listening Challenge.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:56.059
But first, let's talk about how can you understand
fast native speakers.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.510
A lot of people say that if you just keep
listening to English, if you just listen like

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.159
a child again, and again, and again, you're
gonna understand, eventually.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:20.200
But, it takes children a long time, several
years, of listening 24/7, all the time, to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.560
be able to speak clear sentences.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.830
And, you're an adult.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.530
You don't have to wait that long to be able
to use clear sentences.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.040
You don't have to wait that long to understand
native speakers.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:48.490
The best way to understand native speakers
is to study and analyze native speaker conversations.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.149
Try to understand each word.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.090
And use that same sentence structure yourself.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.119
We're gonna use this method, analyzing short
conversations.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.270
Maybe there's idioms you don't know.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.479
Maybe there's phrasal verbs you don't know.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.880
We're gonna use this method together.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.240
I hope that you have a pencil ready.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.140
I hope you have a piece of paper ready.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.100
You can write on your phone, or on another
device.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.040
But, I recommend using a piece of paper.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.620
There's something about physically writing
that helps our brains to soak in the material

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.920
that we're learning.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.650
If you are joining me live for this lesson,
welcome.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.310
Thank you so much.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.200
If you are watching the replay, excellent.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.500
You are welcome here.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.970
I want to welcome all my friends who are here
live from China, and Brazil, and Turkey, and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.690
Syria, India, Chili, Thailand.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.160
Thank you for joining from around the world.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.410
It's a great thought to think that our cultures
are different, our backgrounds are different.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.310
Our families are different.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.349
But, all of us have something in common.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.599
We feel passionate about English.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.030
And that's a really cool thought, I think,
because we have a lot of differences but,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.900
yet we have a great similarity.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.430
So, if you met a friend from China, or a friend
from Brazil, or a friend from Turkey, you

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.220
would have something in common.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.000
You could talk about something passionately.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.170
That's so cool.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.790
But the first step is to be able to talk.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.580
So, we're gonna talk about using that skill
of understanding to be able to improve your

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.390
speaking skills.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.290
Today, I'm gonna help you with four steps.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.590
There are four steps in this analyzing process.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.849
We're gonna be listening to a fast English
conversation clip.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.459
That's the first step.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.810
Then, we're gonna listen to a slow version.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.280
This slow version is really slow and unnatural.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.799
Unnatural means it's kind of too slow.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.019
But, the purpose is to help you hear each
word.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.040
I want you to hear each word yourself, and
then, when you hear that fast version again,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.480
you'll say, "Oh, I understand this.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.250
I can hear every word."

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.900
Your ears and your listening skills will improve.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.620
So that's the second step, listen to the slow
clip.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.410
The third step is to write everything that
you hear.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.210
So, as you're listening to the fast clip,
as you're listening to the slow clip, I want

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.710
you to write down what you hear.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.590
I'm gonna show you on this screen a sample
idea of how you can write our your answer.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.650
It's just gonna be a couple minutes.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:12.020
And then, the final step, the fourth step
is to check your writing to see if it's accurate.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.680
We're gonna look at the transcript of that
fast conversation, so that you can see, "Did

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.080
I understand correctly&gt;?

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.470
Which words are difficult for me?

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.560
How can I improve?"

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:31.810
And, at the end of this lesson, you're gonna
be able to know a new idiom, a useful idiom.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.270
And also, you'll be able to know which sounds
and ideas are challenging for you based on

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.090
your transcript and your writing.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.850
This is a really active lesson.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.770
I want you to participate and use what you're
listening to.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.979
It's quite possible that some friends might
write their answers in the chat box.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.990
If you don't wanna see other friends' answers
before you write your own answers, you can

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.990
close the chat box.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.760
You can cover it.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760
It's up to you.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.419
But I just wanna let you know that other friends
might write in the chat box publicly.

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.160
So, if you want to use the lesson yourself,
you don't wanna use their answers, make sure

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.990
that you're working hard.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.990
If you have any questions about this concept,
or how to use it, feel free to ask me in the

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.990
live chat.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.910
I'll try my best to answer.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:35.110
And, we're gonna get started with the fast
audio clip.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.990
I'm gonna play the audio clip three times.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.759
I'm gonna play it three times.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:42.850
It's quite fast.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.259
So it's only 30 seconds or so.

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.460
The audio will be about one and a half minutes.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.520
I'm gonna play the fast clip three times.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:02.010
And then, I'm going to come back, say a few
words, and then we're gonna listen to the

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.639
slow version three times.

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:12.599
During those three times, I want you to be
writing what you think you hear.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.630
Actually, before we watch the fast clip, I
wanna show you my screen.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.690
I'm gonna show you the style of writing that
you can be doing write now.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.690
All right.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.819
I'm gonna share my screen with you.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.530
You're gonna see a PDF file.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:40.750
This PDF file is, if you decide to join the
30 Day Listening Challenge, which is gonna

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:48.310
be January 1st to January 30th, the first
couple days of the New Year, January as well,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.280
you're gonna receive this on day nine.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.830
So this is the day nine challenge I am sharing
with you today.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.629
I wanna show you the worksheet.

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:02.410
This is kind of what you're writing should
look like.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:16.050
Here you have the day nine worksheet, is similar
to this.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.139
Here we have three people.

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:23.820
Chris is my neighbor.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.300
He is gonna be talking about encouraging yourself.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.110
So, this is a little summary of our conversation.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:39.130
It says, "This clip is from a conversation
with Chris about encouraging yourself when

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.060
you're doing something new."

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.270
We're gonna hear an important idiom about
encouraging yourself.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:53.420
You're gonna hear an important phrasal verb,
and on your paper, you can write exactly like

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.800
this:
Chris:

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.190
Vanessa:
Chris:

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.019
There's gonna be three parts to this conversation.

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:08.140
So make sure that you write down each part:
Chris's part, my part, and then Chris's part.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.260
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to play
this original audio.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.320
Then I'll come back to the video for just
a moment.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.890
I'm gonna play the slow audio.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.779
And then we'll take a look at the transcript
so that you can see how you did.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:23.779
All right.

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:30.560
I'm gonna stop sharing my screen with you
for a moment.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.350
We will listen to the slow audio.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:38.950
So you'll hear my voice, and you'll hear Chris's
voice.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.240
But you'll just see my face.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.240
All right.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240
You ready?

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.140
I'm going to play this for you.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.450
In order to play it for you, I need to turn
off my microphone.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:54.440
So, be patient for just a moment.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.310
We're gonna listen to the fast audio three
times.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.310
Prepare your ears.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.630
Are you ready?

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:05.360
Let's listen.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.459
Day nine, Balance.

00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:10.529
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:13.070
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.710
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.710
Like, you need to have that balance.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.710
Right?

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.709
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:22.910
Chris: Right.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.610
Vanessa: Day nine, balance.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.040
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.940
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.320
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.660
Like, you need to have that balance.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.660
Right?

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.329
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.690
Chris: Right.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.350
Vanessa: Day nine, Balance.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.870
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.810
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.210
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.360
Like, you need to have that balance.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.360
Right?

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.410
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:03.120
Chris: Right.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.839
Vanessa: Okay.

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:13.700
That was the fast version, three times.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.240
If you feel right now like, "Oh my goodness.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.770
That was so fast.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.110
How will I ever understand that?"

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.530
Don't worry.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.790
Chris is talking normally.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.990
All native English speakers will be able to
understand him.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:38.260
But, this is not a slow teacher style conversation.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:45.360
This is fast, and, similar to what you're
gonna hear in TV shows and movies.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:54.470
And, when you are talking in an English business
meeting, when you're going to Disney World,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:12:00.330
or moving to a new country, you're not gonna
hear people speak slowly like this.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.560
They're gonna speak fast like Chris and I
did.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.350
So that's where you need to train your ears
to be able to understand him.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.790
And when you can understand him, you can start
to use English like that as well.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.740
Understanding is the first step.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.160
So, take a deep breath.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:25.380
And, we're gonna listen to the slow version
three times.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.980
This is your chance to write everything that
you hear.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:37.880
If three times isn't enough for you, if you
decide to join the 30 Day Listening Challenge,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.540
these files you can download.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.500
You can listen to them as many times as you
want.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.540
You can pause the file, go back, listen to
one part again, again, and again.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.470
It's your choice.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.399
So, if this is too short, don't worry.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:56.240
This is just our practice session.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.029
After this live lesson is finished, you can
go back and pause this part again and again

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.610
and listen to it as much as you want.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.580
So we're gonna listen to the slow version.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.700
I'm gonna change my microphone to my speaker.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.200
I hope that this will be easier to understand.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.700
This is quite slow.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.540
I'm gonna be reading this slowly.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.810
Are you ready?

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:28.310
Let's listen to the slow version.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.220
Day nine, balance.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.080
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.029
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:45.600
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.310
You need to have that balance.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.310
Right?

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:53.650
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.450
Chris: Right.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.730
Vanessa: Day nine, Balance.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:06.149
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:11.089
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:16.660
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.370
You need to have that balance.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.370
Right?

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:24.240
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.079
Chris: Right.

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:30.430
Vanessa: Day nine, Balance.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:35.300
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:40.250
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:45.820
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.529
You need to have that balance.

00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:48.529
Right?

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:53.120
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.400
Chris: Right.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.830
Vanessa: All right.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.820
How did you do?

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:10.390
Let me know in the chat box if you feel like
you did pretty well.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:16.230
Could you understand and write most of these
words?

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.240
Did you hear them accurately?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.590
Take a deep breath if you feel like it's too
much.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.230
The purpose of this is to give you a general
idea of this method.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:33.269
And, you can go back and listen to the slow
clip, listen to that fast clip, as much as

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:34.269
you want.

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:37.220
This is just a practice version.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.360
I'm gonna give you a moment to finish writing.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.110
And then we're gonna look at the transcript.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:49.450
And, if you did well, you'll be able to see
each word accurately.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:54.800
If you missed some words, this is an excellent
time to see which words were hard for you

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.930
to understand?

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.029
There is a great idiom in here we're gonna
talk about.

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:04.130
And we're gonna talk about an important concept
that was talked about in this short clip.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.110
If you understood the whole meaning of the
clip, you'll have an idea what it is.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.240
Let's take a look at the transcript for this
clip.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:23.500
I'm gonna share my screen and show you the
transcript.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:30.290
Okay.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:38.160
Here we have the transcript for this section.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.339
At the beginning we have everything that was
said in that short clip.

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:47.550
And then down here, we have some important
vocabulary that we're gonna talk about.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:57.230
First of all, Chris said, "'Cause you need
to have checks and balances.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:03.019
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:09.860
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.260
You need to have that balance.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.260
Right?"

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.020
"Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself."

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.120
"Right."

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.939
Okay, so here we have that audio from the
conversation.

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:28.580
But there's a lot of important words that
we talked about.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:36.080
Before we talk about these words down here,
I'm going to stop sharing my screen, and I'm

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.720
gonna see how you did.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.870
Let me know in the chat box how you did.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.640
Which words did you get?

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.010
Which words did you not get?

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:50.169
And if you didn't have a chance to see this
completely, we're gonna come back to this

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:53.580
page so that you can see these new vocabulary
words.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.130
We're gonna talk about these new vocabulary
words.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:03.470
Each day in the 30 Day Listening Challenge
here, each day, I have three words from that

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:09.480
short clip that I give a definition to, that
I explain a little bit, give some samples.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.610
That way you're growing your vocabulary day
by day, and it will help you to hear those

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.170
expressions correctly.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:21.020
Let's go back to my video and see how you
did.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.610
All right.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:29.600
Let me know how was your listening skills
for this quick conversation?

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.200
This conversation was just, really, a couple
seconds.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.210
But, he used some important words, and spoke
really quickly.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.210
Let me know.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.549
Oh, we've got a lot of interesting answers.

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:45.770
Some people said, "Great.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.970
I got it."

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:52.820
Some people said, "Oh, it's difficult to catch
everything."

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.640
Some people said, "Oh, it was too much."

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.419
Some people said, "When it was slower, it
was easier.

00:18:58.419 --> 00:19:02.090
I prefer the slow version.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.780
I got 90%.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.090
And then I got 100% of the slow version."

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.990
"I can understand 70%."

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.290
All right.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.940
Excellent.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:21.000
For you going from the fast version to the
slow version was helpful, because you could

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.120
hear each word.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:30.070
So now, what we're gonna do is, I'm gonna
play the fast version.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.200
And I'm gonna show you the transcript at the
same time.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.650
So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna listen
to the fast version three times again.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.990
It's just a couple seconds.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.370
We're gonna listen to the fast version three
times again.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.720
I'm gonna show you the transcript, so that
you can follow along.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.860
And if you missed something, you'll hear how
it sounds.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.730
So let's go back to my screen.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.740
I'm gonna show you the transcript.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:01.280
And then we're gonna listen to the fast version,
not the slow version, because the slow version

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.750
isn't the normal one.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:09.000
That's just the practice version to help you
study English.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:17.440
Let's look at my screen, and follow along
with the original audio.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.400
Day nine ...
All right.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:29.000
I'm going to ... there's always a little technological
stuff you have to do whenever you have a live

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
video.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.809
So, patience is key.

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:33.330
All right.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.539
Let's take a look at this.

00:20:37.539 --> 00:20:44.980
All right.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.650
Here we have the transcript.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:51.720
I'm going to play the audio just over here.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:21:01.090
I'm gonna play the audio so that you can ... follow
along and listen.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.710
Are you ready?

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:09.620
Well, actually I have to do something technological
first.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.620
I'm sorry.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.620
Okay.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.620
We're back.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.620
Just a moment.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.980
I'm gonna change over my microphone so that
you can hear the audio.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.980
All right.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.110
Let's listen.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:26.150
Nine, Balance.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:38.630
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.039
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:44.799
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:45.799
Like, you need to have that balance.

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:46.799
Right?

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:47.820
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.200
Chris: Right.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.950
Vanessa: Day nine, balance.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.560
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.120
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.730
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.730
Like, you need to have that balance.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.730
Right?

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.190
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.490
Chris: Right.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.700
Vanessa: Day nine, Balance.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.320
Chris: 'Cause you need to have checks and
balances.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.700
You need to tell yourself, like, I'm doing
a good job.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.490
And you also need to tell yourself, like,
you're not doing good enough.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.490
Like, you need to have that balance.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.490
Right?

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.790
Vanessa: Yeah, and not be too hard on yourself.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:31.809
Chris: Right.

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:34.320
Okay.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:40.890
So, we listened to the audio fast while you
were looking at the transcript.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.390
That's an important step to test your listening
skills.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.450
Now, we're gonna talk about the vocabulary.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:54.840
Feel free to let me know in the chat box how
you did so far.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.809
Let's take a look at the transcript again
and see the three important expressions.

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:05.710
There's especially two that I wanna focus
on quickly at the end of this lesson.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.150
The first one is an idiom.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:13.929
The second one is another important expression
for building yourself up and not feeling too

00:23:13.929 --> 00:23:15.360
bad.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.470
Let's take a look at the transcript.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.740
I'm gonna share my screen again.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.300
All right.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.470
You can see the transcript here.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.120
We're gonna take a look at these vocabulary
words at the bottom.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.370
The first one is checks and balances.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:40.210
This is an idiom, as you can imagine, about
balance.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:48.440
If you make mistakes in English, and you feel
really bad, you just feel devastated, and

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.590
think about it the next day, you think about
it the next night, you can't sleep, that's

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.670
really negative.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.250
That's not gonna help your mindset.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.330
That's one extreme.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:04.290
The other extreme is that you don't really
care about improving.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:09.340
You say, "Oh, I can say my name.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.550
I can talk about the weather.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.550
That's all.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.550
I don't need any more."

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:18.220
But, if you wanna improve, you're gonna have
to be in the middle somewhere.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.539
You can't be too extreme on one side or the
other.

00:24:22.539 --> 00:24:23.539
You can't be negative.

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:25.049
You can't be completely positive.

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:27.270
You have to be in the middle.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.840
So that's the expression that Chris used,
"checks and balances."

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.270
I wrote here that this is an idiom about the
government.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:41.640
Usually we talk about this when we talk about
the President, that he needs checks and balances.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.320
He needs a parliament.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.409
He needs a Congress.

00:24:44.409 --> 00:24:51.230
He needs advisors, people who will make sure
that he doesn't become a king, or a dictator,

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.520
or someone who is the only person in control.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.309
So he needs checks and balances.

00:24:56.309 --> 00:25:02.210
But here, we're talking about the mental idea
that you don't wanna be too negative.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.529
You don't wanna be too positive.

00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:05.950
You need to be in the middle.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.950
So he gave a perfect example of this in the
conversation.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:13.440
He said, "On one side, I'm doing good job.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.860
And on the other side, you're not doing good
enough."

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:22.040
And, if you have any questions about doing
good enough, here we see that this is, you're

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.110
doing it well, but it's just not enough.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.360
It's not acceptable.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.470
So, you need to balance that in your mind.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:37.360
And if you feel like that's difficult for
you, if it's difficult for you to tell yourself,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.779
"I'm doing a good job," you can use the third
expression.

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:48.429
The third expression is to be hard on yourself,
to be hard on yourself.

00:25:48.429 --> 00:25:51.840
I said, "Don't be too hard on yourself."

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.580
You can see that here in this quick clip.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.190
We've got a lot of expressions in this quick
clip.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.100
"Don't be too hard on yourself."

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.970
This means, as I wrote here, you're working
hard, but it's never enough.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.600
It's never good enough.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.000
So, of course, it's good to always be working
and always be trying to improve.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.820
But, at the same time, you have to be satisfied
with your progress.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:23.840
You have to have some kind of positivity about
your work, because if you never feel positive,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.370
then you're gonna quit.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.740
It's not gonna be easy to continue.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.309
So, don't be too hard on yourself.

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:34.740
You can say, "Oh, I need to improve more."

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.260
But, if you always are thinking, "Oh, my English
is always terrible.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.610
I'm never gonna improve.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:47.760
This is just impossible," well, you're gonna
quit because it's not fun to study something

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.429
where you have such a negative mindset.

00:26:49.429 --> 00:26:50.429
All right.

00:26:50.429 --> 00:26:53.010
I'm gonna go back to my video here.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:27:01.640
I hope that, for you, you are not feeling
like you are too hard on yourself.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.090
I hope that you use this concept, literally,
in your life.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:12.460
That you will encourage yourself, but you
will have some checks and balances.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.260
You'll say, "I'm doing good, but I'm not doing
good enough.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.309
I have improved.

00:27:18.309 --> 00:27:19.720
I have progressed.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.330
But, I need to improve more."

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.809
This is the perfect balance for really anything
that you're learning.

00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:28.580
I hope that it will help your mindset.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.090
I hope that it will help you to not be too
hard on yourself.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.660
So, as you can see from this short clip, we
can learn a lot.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.130
We can learn some good concepts.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.899
We can also learn vocabulary.

00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:45.649
You're gonna hear that expression, "checks
and balances," and "hard on yourself."

00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:50.110
You're gonna hear those in daily conversations
in your office.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.280
You're gonna hear them in TV shows and movies.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.830
I hope that it will help you to understand
native speakers even better.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.000
Let me know in the chat box.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.410
Are any of these expressions new to you?

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.429
Have you heard checks and balances?

00:28:07.429 --> 00:28:13.320
Have you used good enough or not good enough?

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.279
Have you used to be hard on yourself?

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.409
Have you used those before?

00:28:17.409 --> 00:28:18.809
Have you heard them before?

00:28:18.809 --> 00:28:20.549
Let me know in the chat box.

00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:27.270
And let me know if this whole concept of studying
fast conversations, slow conversations, checking

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.049
your writing, if that's useful to you.

00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:37.520
Because, if it's useful to you, I want to
invite you to continue using this.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:49.210
Right now, from December 19th until December
31st, 2017, the 30 Day Listening Challenge

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.850
is open to join.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:56.790
On December 31st, it's gonna close, because
on January 1st, it opens.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.289
So you need to join before it closes.

00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:04.409
We're gonna be studying this exact method
every day in January.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:09.270
Even though this live lesson is 30 minutes
or so, when you're studying by yourself, it's

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.610
only five to 10 minutes.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.810
You can just listen to the clip, listen again,
and again, and again.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:15.980
Write down your answers.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.090
Check with the transcript.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.590
Listen again.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:23.149
And you'll see, day by day, your listening
skills are improving.

00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:27.830
There are 30 clips like the one that we looked
at today.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.580
So, by the end of the month, you're gonna
know a lot of expressions, a lot of idioms.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.070
You're gonna test your ears every day.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:41.360
And you'll also know which ideas and concepts,
and sounds are difficult for you.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.909
That's gonna help you improve your listening,
but also, ultimately, improve your speaking,

00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:52.159
because you're gonna be able to imitate those
things and learn them, and put them into your

00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:55.659
memory to be used when you speak English.

00:29:55.659 --> 00:30:02.929
So, if you would like to join the 30 Day Listening
Challenge, I'm gonna share my screen one final

00:30:02.929 --> 00:30:04.550
time with you today.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.900
All right.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:11.290
Let's take a look at ... my screen.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:17.799
Here we have ... the page.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:26.520
There is a link in the description below this
video, speakenglishwithvanessa.com/listening.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.950
That is this page you can see here at the
top.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.529
Speakenglishwithvanessa.com/listening.

00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:41.429
At the time of this live lesson, there are
five days left to join the course.

00:30:41.429 --> 00:30:44.740
You can click here to join the Challenge.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.789
Clear and simple.

00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:49.890
But you'll also be able to learn more information
about the course.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:58.091
So, if this practice lesson, today, was useful
to you, but you have some questions, feel

00:30:58.091 --> 00:31:02.090
free to check out another sample here.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.530
You can check out the bonuses that you'll
receive.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.820
The challenge is $30.00.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.000
So 30 day challenge for $30.00.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.090
That's a dollar per day.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:16.730
And, you'll be able to download all of this
material and keep it.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:19.960
So you could do the challenge every day of
this year if you wanted.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.980
You could repeat it 12 times.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.580
That's your choice.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.820
And there are a bunch of questions at the
bottom, frequently asked questions.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.190
Can I download the lessons?

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.190
Yes.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.190
How much will it be?

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.190
$30.00.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:39.919
You can click on each of these questions and
see the answer.

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:46.279
So if you have any questions about the course,
feel free to check this out.

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:56.790
When the course closes, on 
December 31st, if you're watching this after

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:04.390
December 31st, click on the link in the description
to see when the next listening challenge will

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:13.299
be, because a lot of people have joined already,
and will go through the course.

00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:19.779
I hope that they will have positive things
to say about this amazing month long challenge

00:32:19.779 --> 00:32:22.830
so we can do it again with new clips.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.920
You could join this old challenge in the future.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.539
But, it's best to join the first time, because
it might happen again.

00:32:31.539 --> 00:32:37.220
It might not happen again, and this is gonna
be our fun New Year's Resolution.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:44.640
I hope that you will take the challenge and
decide, "I'm gonna improve my English in 2018.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.659
I'm gonna improve my listening skills, challenge
myself a little bit every day."

00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:54.070
Five to 10 minutes is all that it will take.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:33:02.090
I hope that this video today was useful for
you, was fun to challenge yourself and try

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.440
to understand fast conversation.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.539
Feel free to go back and practice it again.

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:12.110
I hope that you will continue to learn English
with me in the New Year.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.519
In January, join me in the 30 Day Listening
Challenge.

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:19.330
The link, in the description, or go to SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com/listening.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:25.230
Thanks so much for learning with me today
at this live lesson.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.029
I really appreciate it.

00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:30.610
Continue to improve your English.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.500
Don't be too hard on yourself.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.500
Enjoy it.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.500
Thanks so much!

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.500
I'll see you later.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:35.510
Bye.
