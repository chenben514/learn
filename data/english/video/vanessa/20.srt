00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.649
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.Com.

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.689
What should you do to become a fluent English
speaker?

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.790
Let's talk about it.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.439
I'd love for you to be able to speak English
confidently, fearlessly, and fluently.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.410
Wouldn't that be great?

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.420
I'd also love to be able to do a pull up,
just one, that's all I ask.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.949
Or be able to run a 10K.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:37.020
But all of these things take slow and steady
work day, by day, by day, by day.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.920
Do you think that I could do a pull up tomorrow?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920
No.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.400
Do you think that I could run a 10K tomorrow?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Probably not.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.600
I need to practice little by little every
day.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.340
It's the same with speaking English confidently,
fearlessly, and fluently.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.450
There's no get rich quick scheme to help you
learn English fast.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.150
Of course it doesn't need to be boring and
monotonous, but you need to have daily practice.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.820
So today we're going to talk about the top
five habits of fluent English speakers.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.920
So if you want to speak English confidently
and fearlessly, fluently, just follow these

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.120
five steps.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.380
Number one, assess how much English you use
now and what you're doing to improve.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.820
Maybe you could take a notebook and write
down, can I understand Vanessa?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.850
90%.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.580
Can I understand TV shows and movies?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.600
90%.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.750
Can I talk comfortably about my family and
my job?

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.190
Can I talk comfortably about cultural, societal
problems in my country, or generational differences?

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.360
Those are just some general questions to help
you assess how much you currently know.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.420
Where do you currently stand?

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.580
The important part of this is looking to see
what you are currently doing to improve from

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.450
where you are right now.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.440
I want you to write down everything that you
currently do daily or at least weekly to improve

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.580
your English.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.860
Do you watch a YouTube video every day in
English?

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.860
Great.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.020
How much time do you spend doing that?

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.250
Do you occasionally speak with your German
coworker in English?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.709
Great, write that down, and write down what
you usually talk about, because those topics

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.690
are repeated again and again.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.540
When we assess our current level and also
what we're currently doing to improve, one

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.150
of two things happens.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.400
Either you feel like you're not doing a lot
to improve, but in reality, when you assess

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.010
it you realize, "Oh, I am doing a lot to try
to improve.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.040
I'm doing pretty well."

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.310
Or, on the other hand, you think that you're
doing a lot to try to improve, but when you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.099
assess that you realize, "Oh, maybe I'm not
doing that much, and maybe that's why I'm

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.250
not improving."

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.220
So this assessment stage is the first step
and it's vital.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.319
The second habit of a fluent English speaker
is to be positive about your progress.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.130
Your mindset is really important.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.660
My most successful English students are the
ones who say, "Oh, I just made a mistake.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.660
Oh well."

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.099
Or, "Wow, a year ago it was really hard to
understand my American boss, but now I can

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.629
understand her a little bit better."

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.390
Even small wins you can be positive about.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.720
"I had a really busy day at work today, but
I listened to an English podcast on the way

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720
home from work.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720
I did it.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.459
I spent some time to improve my English."

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.170
Even those small things you can feel positive
about.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.379
Having that positive mindset is the key to
helping you become a fluent English speaker.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.090
You need to make it a habit.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.370
The third habit of a fluent English speaker
is to fit English into your daily life.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.780
Everyone is busy.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.770
If you're busy, you're not unusual.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.190
I'm not saying it's good to be busy, but it's
at least normal.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.270
So it's important for you to fit English easily
into your daily life because you probably

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.060
don't have two hours free every day.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.159
Here are a few suggestions, there are many
others on my channel.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.390
You can change your device to English, change
your phone to English, change your computer

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.690
to English.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.640
That way you're just constantly surrounded
by English as you're looking at your phone

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.500
or as you're using the computer.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.230
If you are a list-maker like me, make the
list about what you're going to do that day

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.950
or what you're going to do that week in English.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.630
That way you're having to think about the
best verbs, the best way to explain things.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.940
It's another way to fit English easily into
your daily life because it's something that

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.370
you were already going to do, but you're just
going to do it in English now.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.320
You could sing to English music.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.360
You could even make a playlist of four or
five songs that you really like, print out

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.570
the lyrics, read the lyrics as you're listening
to the song a couple times so that you feel

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.260
comfortable with them, and then listen to
the songs a lot, eventually you'll be able

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.199
to sing out loud with them.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.949
And we can listen to music in the little bits
of time we have during the day while you're

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.740
driving, while you're making breakfast.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.150
This is a great way to have natural English
sentences in your mind.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.070
If you don't know where to start with English
music, I made a video about 11 songs to learn

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.740
English that I recommend, you can check out
this video up here, and it's just a good way

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.740
to get started.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.320
This is a beautiful way to become a natural
fluent speaker.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.560
You could listen to English podcasts.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.400
When you're busy, this is something that's
really easy to do.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.360
It's easier to listen than to sit on the couch
and watch a video.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.440
You can listen to something and do something
else at the same time like household chores.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.560
For example, when my husband Dan, every time
he does the laundry, every time he folds the

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.090
laundry, he's always listening to a podcast.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.410
In fact, I think it's impossible for him to
fold the laundry without a podcast, he just

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.810
wouldn't be able to do it.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.890
Or whenever I do the dishes, I like to listen
to a podcast.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.210
I'm multitasking, but it's not too hard because
doing the dishes, folding the laundry, it's

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.290
a mindless task so you can also listen to
something, have a good time listening to something

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.470
at the same time.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.699
If you want any recommendations for podcasts
to help you learn English, I made video about

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.400
my top nine recommendations.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.229
Also, some other people in the comments left
some other great podcasts for learning English,

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.180
but you can check out this video I made up
here about my podcast recommendations.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.150
These are just a few ideas to help you easily
and seamlessly fit English into your daily

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.150
life.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.070
The next habit of a fluent English speaker
is to speak English at least once a week.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.520
If you don't speak English regularly, you'll
lose what you know.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520
It's just a fact.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.440
If you don't run regularly, you'll lose your
endurance.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.870
If you don't do pull ups regularly, you'll
lose your muscles, your muscles will weaken.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.139
Fluent English speakers speak English regularly.

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.150
If you don't feel like you have any native
English speakers who live near you, or you

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.420
don't have time to find them, I challenge
you to check out this video I made up here

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.680
about how you can successfully learn English
from home, learn English without traveling

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.380
to an English speaking country.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.009
There are a lot of tips to help you get started
speaking now because there is no time to waste.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.440
If you're not practicing, you're losing it,
so make sure that you speak English regularly.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.290
The final habit of a fluent English speaker
is that fluent speakers will take opportunities

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.590
when they come.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.389
Do you have the opportunity to go to lunch
with a British representative from your company?

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:14.389
Go!

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.479
Go to that lunch, speak English with them,
listen to English.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.660
Take that opportunity.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.030
Do you have the opportunity to watch English
cartoons with your child?

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.250
Do that, listen to the English cartoons.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:31.130
Turn on the subtitles if you need to, but
that's a great way to take opportunities.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.889
Sometimes we feel like we don't have a chance
to do something, but it's often because an

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:41.690
opportunity came, we might even say an opportunity
came knocking, and we weren't listening.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.870
So make sure that your ears are open for opportunities,
because fluent English speakers take opportunities

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.080
when they're available.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.560
Let's do a quick review.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.150
The five habits of fluent English speakers,
which will hopefully be you very soon, is

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.210
to number one, assess what you know and what
you're doing to improve.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.000
Number two is to be positive about your progress.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.060
Number three is to fit English into your daily
life.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.110
Number four is to speak English at least once
a week.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.150
And the final fifth tip is to take opportunities
when they come.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.510
And now I have a question for you.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:24.259
I want to know, what do you think are some
other habits of fluent English speakers?

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.850
Read the comments and get some ideas from
each other, because it is a great idea to

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.050
speak English confidently, fearlessly, and
fluently.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.250
You can do it.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.279
