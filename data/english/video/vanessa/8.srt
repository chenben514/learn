00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from&nbsp;
SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.440
Do you like chocolate chip cookies?&nbsp;
I hope so. Let's talk about it.&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.680
Today, I'd like to invite you to join me on a&nbsp;
special baking adventure. My three-year-old son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.520
Theo and I are going to be baking chocolate chip&nbsp;
cookies, mixing the ingredients, putting them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.280
the oven, eating them, dunking them in milk. It&nbsp;
will be a long journey. I hope you will enjoy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.520
But along the way, I'm going to be using a lot of&nbsp;
phrasal verbs for daily conversation that we often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.400
use for baking, cooking, eating, and drinking. So&nbsp;
you can use these phrasal verbs in the kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.840
but also in a lot of other situations. I hope&nbsp;
that this natural setting will be a great way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.840
for you to remember the phrasal verbs and also be&nbsp;
able to use them yourself. So make sure you check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.360
out all the phrasal verbs that I put up here on&nbsp;
the screen and enjoy this wonderful baking time.&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.360
All right, we're going to make chocolate&nbsp;
chip cookies. Do you remember the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.960
thing we got to do?
Theo: What?&nbsp;

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.240
Vanessa: We got to suit up. You got&nbsp;
to put your apron on. Can I help you?&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.080
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: All right. All right. Turn around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.120
I'm going to tie it on. There we go.&nbsp;
Make sure you don't trip on it. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.960
about me? Should I wear mine too?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.400
Vanessa: Okay. All right. The first thing&nbsp;
we got to do is check out our recipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.240
What kind of things do you think we need&nbsp;
on here? Can you tell me what it says?&nbsp;

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.320
Theo: We need these, these, these
Vanessa: Yeah? We need flour. We need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.800
cornstarch. I forgot to get that. I'll have to&nbsp;
get it off the shelf. We need baking powder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.840
baking soda, salt, butter, eggs, brown sugar,&nbsp;
regular sugar, vanilla, and chocolate chips.&nbsp;

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.400
Theo: Whoa.
Vanessa: That's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.600
of stuff. Isn't it? Now I already got out the&nbsp;
butter. We had to soften it up first, and I got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.240
out all of the ingredients, except I forgot to&nbsp;
get the corn starch. Do you know where it is?&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.120
Theo: Where?
Vanessa: I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.360
going to have to take it off the shelf. All right.&nbsp;
Before we do anything, we got to look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.080
first step. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees&nbsp;
and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.120
Theo: The parchment paper.
Vanessa: Where's the parchment paper?&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.760
Theo: Down here.
Vanessa: All right. Well, why don't you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.640
get that out while I heat up the oven?
Theo: This one?&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.040
Vanessa: Yes, that's right. Can&nbsp;
you bring it up to the counter?&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.720
Theo: Is it this big? This big?
Vanessa: Why don't we try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.120
measure it out? Can you set it up here please?&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.920
Theo: In these?
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.040
That's right. All right. Climb on up. Let's&nbsp;
measure it out. Is that a good length?&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.600
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: All right. I got to tear it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.300
Okay.
Theo: That's a really good length.&nbsp;

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.080
Vanessa: That's good. All right.&nbsp;
We're going to set that aside.&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.040
Theo: Then we're going to open the thing?
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.360
Now, we got to see what the next step&nbsp;
is. Sift together the flour, cornstarch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.880
baking powder, baking soda and salt. All&nbsp;
right. We're going to put that in here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.000
The first thing is the flour. That's a nice loud&nbsp;
sound. Isn't it? It says we need three cups.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.720
Wow. These are going to be a lot of cookies.&nbsp;
Yep. Scoop it up. And you know we got to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.160
Level it off. Okay. Dump it in. Good. You want&nbsp;
to pat it a little bit to make sure that you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:43.520
got it all out. Great work. Okay. Scoop it out.&nbsp;
Remember what the next thing is? Level it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.840
That's right. How's that feel?
Theo: Good.&nbsp;

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.880
Vanessa: Okay. Make another scoop.
Theo: We got to do-&nbsp;

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.920
Vanessa: Make sure it's all full otherwise&nbsp;
it's not going to make good cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.360
There you go. Okay. Level it off. An important&nbsp;
part about leveling it off is that you don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.480
to pat it down. You just want to push it. There&nbsp;
you go. Otherwise, you might get too much flour.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.720
Okay. Dump it in. Okay. The next thing we need is&nbsp;
the corn starch. How much corn starch do we need?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.520
Two tablespoons. All right.&nbsp;
Can you scoop this one? Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.120
we got lots of that. Let's put&nbsp;
a little extra bonus flour.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.520
All right. This is very important that we don't&nbsp;
take too much. Do you remember what to do? Scoop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.234
it and then try to level it off in there.
Theo: Like the flour?&nbsp;

00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:48.240
Vanessa: That's right. Okay. Dump it in. That's&nbsp;
one. This is going to help make them extra fluffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.260
All right. Level it off. There you go.
Theo: I leveled off when I scoop it.&nbsp;

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:03.040
Vanessa: That's right. Okay. Let's see what the&nbsp;
next thing says. Baking powder. We need one and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.040
half teaspoons. All right. This is one teaspoon,&nbsp;
and we're going to do baking powder first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.480
Now, do you know what this one has? It has&nbsp;
a little piece of metal here to help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.920
level it off. Why don't you get a good&nbsp;
scoop, then I'll show you how it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.191
Almost. Let's get a bigger scoop so&nbsp;
that it's all full. There you go.&nbsp;

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:25.840
Theo: I think we almost taked all of it.
Vanessa: You did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.960
Yeah. You're right. There's not much left.&nbsp;
All right. Now, we need a half scoop.&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.840
Theo: Of this?
Vanessa: Yeah. How can we get just a half?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.751
Let's try to drop half of it back.
Theo: There.&nbsp;

00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:42.640
Vanessa: That's good. All right.&nbsp;
Level it off. How is that?&nbsp;

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.640
Theo: Good.
Vanessa: Okay. Now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.840
have baking soda. We're going to only get half a&nbsp;
teaspoon. Can you do a half of one of those again?&nbsp;

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.280
Theo: Use this?
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.920
Yeah, the small ones, but this time... Oh, it&nbsp;
doesn't fit in there. You know what we can do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.640
We have another one that's thin.&nbsp;
So why don't you stick it in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.800
scoop and then you can level it off, but we only&nbsp;
need half. Oh, that's great. Great. Good work.&nbsp;

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.040
Theo: Iâ€™m flattening...
Vanessa: All right. Now we need a little salt.&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.480
Theo: I'm flattening it out with this.
Vanessa: We're going to do this the scientific way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.120
and just do a couple twists. You want to help&nbsp;
me twist it? Squeeze and turn really hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.360
There you go. One more time. There we go. Don't&nbsp;
want them to be too salty, huh? All right. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.680
I have an important job for you. I need you to mix&nbsp;
it up. Stir it very gently and put your hands here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:47.840
to hold it steady. There you go. Mix, mix, mix.
Theo: When are we going to do the chocolate chips?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.920
Is that the last thing?
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.000
Yep. The chocolate chips are the last thing.&nbsp;
All right. I'm going to clean off some of this.&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.400
Theo: Now we need this.
Vanessa: Bonus. Okay. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.000
we're going to set this aside.
Theo: And then we're going to do this bowl?&nbsp;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.908
Vanessa: Yeah. Do you know what goes in this bowl?
Theo: What?&nbsp;

00:07:07.908 --> 00:07:10.960
Vanessa: The wet ingredients.&nbsp;
You know what was in that bowl?&nbsp;

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.280
Theo: Dry.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.320
That's right. The dry ingredients.&nbsp;
So it says in a separate bowl-&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.480
Theo: We can put the eggs in here?
Vanessa: Yeah. Do you want to help me crack them?&nbsp;

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.200
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: All right.&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.400
Theo: I'm going to get this one.
Vanessa: But first we have to do the butter first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.520
Can you feel this butter? Does it feel hard?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:41.600
Vanessa: It's a little hard. We need to squish it&nbsp;
in our hands. You think you can do that? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.480
it said it needed to soften up a little bit, but&nbsp;
I don't think I let it soften up enough. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.080
do this. Oh yes. Squeeze it.
Theo: To make it melt.&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.920
Vanessa: That's right. To make it melt a little&nbsp;
bit so that it's not too hard. All right. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:04.720
probably good. It's just going to be really&nbsp;
hard to mix it. This is a lot of butter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.080
Good for fattening you up.
Theo:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.880
Wow.
Vanessa: Wow.&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.880
Theo: Let me take it [inaudible 00:08:16].
Vanessa: All right. You want to take it out?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.840
Can you take off the wrapper?&nbsp;
Hold the wrapper and shake it in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.280
Flop it in. There you go.
Theo: Next. The eggs.&nbsp;

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.840
Vanessa: Next, we have sugar. There's&nbsp;
two different types of sugar. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.000
brown sugar, which is just regular sugar&nbsp;
with a little bit of molasses in it. Yum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.340
And the sugar. Which one should we do first?
Theo: That.&nbsp;

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.200
Vanessa: The brown one? Okay. Let's see. It&nbsp;
says one third cup. Can you give me that big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.240
cup over there?
Theo: This one?&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.240
Vanessa: The big white one.
Theo: This one?&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.430
Vanessa: No.
Theo: This one?&nbsp;

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.975
Vanessa: That's right.
Theo: Can I do that?&nbsp;

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:07.840
Vanessa: All right. I'm going to dump it in there,&nbsp;
and what I want you to do is to pack it down.&nbsp;

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.472
Theo: No, you pat it down.&nbsp;
I'm going to dump it in.&nbsp;

00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:13.840
Vanessa: You want to dump it in while I hold this?
Theo: No, I'm going to hold it.&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.200
Vanessa: You're going to hold it? Okay.
Theo: And I'm going to dump it in too.&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.960
Vanessa: Really? Here, why&nbsp;
don't you help me with it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.880
There we go. Whoa. Okay. Now what I want you&nbsp;
to do is use your fingers and pack it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.160
That's the thing about brown sugar. When it&nbsp;
says three fourths of a cup, it always means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.480
packed down really hard. Push it really hard. This&nbsp;
is different than the flour. That's a good amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.200
All right. Let's try to wipe it off your fingers.
Theo: Dump it on the butter.&nbsp;

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.080
Vanessa: Dump it on the butter. That's right.&nbsp;
Hold on tight to this. I'm going to pour it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.360
in. Are you ready? You got a little&nbsp;
bit of stuff on your face. Ready?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.465
Okay. Dump it in.
Theo: And then...&nbsp;

00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:59.280
Vanessa: This one we don't need to&nbsp;
pack down. You can just dump it in.&nbsp;

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.320
Theo: And the sugar?
Vanessa: That's right.&nbsp;

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:10.240
Theo: And the other sugar?
Vanessa: Yep. I'm going to put this butter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.600
in here. We're not professional chefs.&nbsp;
It's okay. I'm going to throw it in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.400
microwave for a couple of seconds and&nbsp;
then it will be nice and soft for us.&nbsp;

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.407
Theo: We're good chefs.
Vanessa: We're what?&nbsp;

00:10:27.407 --> 00:10:30.800
Theo: We're good chefs.
Vanessa: We're good chefs. Wow. All right. Now our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.880
butter is a little bit soft. Maybe a little too&nbsp;
soft. So they might not be super fluffy cookies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.080
but it's still going to be a little bit easier.
Theo: Is it going to be really good still?&nbsp;

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.400
Vanessa: It is going to be really good still. And&nbsp;
when you're baking together, sometimes you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.720
have to make concessions. All right. I'm going to&nbsp;
pour this in and it can be your job to mix them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.760
together. You think you can do it?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.120
Vanessa: Okay.
Theo:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.760
Maybe we should make banana cookies with it in it.
Vanessa: Banana cookies. How do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.440
you make banana cookies?
Theo: You put bananas in it.&nbsp;

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.160
Vanessa: Well, of course. That makes&nbsp;
sense. I'm going to scrape out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.280
last little bits of butter. And now can you&nbsp;
use that spatula or the fork to mix it up?&nbsp;

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.640
Theo: I'm going to do this. Now-
Vanessa: We're going to still mix that in.&nbsp;

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.880
Theo: Will you mix it a little bit?
Vanessa: You want me to mix it a little bit?&nbsp;

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.000
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.840
Do you want to put a hand on mine while I do it?&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.480
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: Okay. We'll do it really fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.069
How is that?
Theo: Good.&nbsp;

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:43.600
Vanessa: Do you know what that is?
Theo: What?&nbsp;

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.000
Vanessa: The oven is ready. It's heated up enough,&nbsp;
but we have to finish making our cookie batter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.080
first. All right. The next thing is we got to&nbsp;
put in our eggs. Crack the eggs. Can you help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.680
me with it? All right. You want to put your&nbsp;
hand on mine? Three, two, one. Break. Whoa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.680
That was a pretty big crack. Wasn't it?
Theo: I'll get the other egg.&nbsp;

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:15.120
Vanessa: Here. All right. Thank you. We're going&nbsp;
to do a big crack this time. Whoa. Watch out. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.880
got to do it first. Ready? Three, two, one. Oh,&nbsp;
you did it. Wow. That was a kind of good crack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.444
All right.
Theo: Can I mix?&nbsp;

00:12:23.444 --> 00:12:26.960
Vanessa: There's one other thing we have&nbsp;
to add and that's some vanilla. I never-&nbsp;

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.040
Theo: Quick, quick, quick.
Vanessa: I never measure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.200
vanilla. I always just eyeball it.
Theo: When are we ready?&nbsp;

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.640
Vanessa: Well, it's going to be ready in&nbsp;
just a moment because remember that other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.800
bowl with the dry ingredients? We got to mix them&nbsp;
together. Now I'm going to scrape down the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.640
Everything looks mixed together really well.&nbsp;
Blend until smooth and fluffy. Does it look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.680
smooth and fluffy to you?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.320
Vanessa: Good. Okay. The next thing is&nbsp;
to add the flour mixture to the butter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.825
mixture. You think you can help with that?
Theo: Oh, Iâ€™ll dump it right by myself!&nbsp;

00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:05.840
Vanessa: See, it says a little at a time. You&nbsp;
think you can dump a little bit at a time?&nbsp;

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.800
Theo: I dump it.
Vanessa: Okay. Well, the recipe says a little at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.200
a time. That will probably help it to not be too&nbsp;
hard. Okay. Let's mix this in and then we'll do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.232
again. Thank you. Okay. You want to do it?
Theo: No, you do it.&nbsp;

00:13:21.232 --> 00:13:27.520
Vanessa: You want me to do it?
Theo: My job is to scrape the batter off with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.760
the fork.
Vanessa: Okay. You can do it when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.200
I have it on the spatula. All right.
Theo:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.720
We're good chefs.
Vanessa: We are good chefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.840
Thank you for scraping that off. Ready, mix.
Theo: Really fast.&nbsp;

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.320
Vanessa: Well, I want to make sure that the&nbsp;
flour is incorporated before I go too fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:00.000
So it doesn't fly away into the air.
Theo: Fly away to North Carolina.&nbsp;

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.680
Vanessa: Yeah. I mean, we are in North Carolina,&nbsp;
but I know what you mean. All right. Let's pour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.120
in the rest. Do you want to dump the rest in? Good&nbsp;
work. We bought two different kinds of chocolate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.080
chips. So which one do you think we should use?
Theo: First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:23.040
we're going to make two of them. We're going to&nbsp;
put two the of the kinds of chocolate chips in.&nbsp;

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.440
Vanessa: Oh, okay. Two different types of&nbsp;
chocolate chips in? Oh, that's one way to open it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.840
Let's see how many it says to put in. Two cups.&nbsp;
That's so many. What if we do one cup of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.640
kind and one cup of that kind?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.960
Vanessa: Okay. Can you put them in&nbsp;
this cup first so we can measure it?&nbsp;

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:45.040
Theo: First one I scoop it out.
Vanessa: Okay. That's the exciting part.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.200
You want to gobble up a couple?
Theo: This many.&nbsp;

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.560
Vanessa: Whoa. Okay. That's going&nbsp;
to be your secret stash. Okay.&nbsp;

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.640
Theo: And yellow bag, this one too.
Vanessa: Okay.&nbsp;

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.800
Theo: A little bit of each.
Vanessa: You can eat a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:15.440
bit of each. All right. Let's try to measure&nbsp;
out one cup of that. I'll eat a couple too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.449
Let's pour them in.
Theo: A little bit. Those are better.&nbsp;

00:15:27.449 --> 00:15:34.480
Vanessa: Those are better? Which one do you&nbsp;
think is best? These ones or those ones?&nbsp;

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.193
Theo: Those ones.
Vanessa: Those ones? They're both chocolate.&nbsp;

00:15:40.193 --> 00:15:42.880
Theo: Now I have to get another one.
Vanessa: Oh, because I took some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.720
from your pile. That's fair.
Theo: Now I need some water.&nbsp;

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.600
Vanessa: I agree. That was really a&nbsp;
lot. The recipe says that we can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.000
just mix the chocolate chips in here. We have&nbsp;
to fold them in. Do you know what that means?&nbsp;

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.720
Theo: What?
Vanessa: Is it like folding your clothes?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.200
We got to fold this like our clothes?
Theo: No.&nbsp;

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.480
Vanessa: No, you're right. We're not going&nbsp;
to fold it like clothes, but we have to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.920
it gently. That's the idea. We have to mix it&nbsp;
gently kind of like you fold your clothes gently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:24.800
I'm going to fold this, scraping the outside, and&nbsp;
carefully, tenderly our precious little chocolate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.420
chips. Are you okay in there?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.080
Vanessa: Isn't that what they said? They said yes.
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.840
Vanessa: Wow. I didn't even know they could&nbsp;
talk. What else do chocolate chips say?&nbsp;

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:43.040
Theo: Eat the chocolate chips that are right here.
Vanessa: Oh, they're telling us to eat more?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.840
Oh my goodness. That's a silly chocolate&nbsp;
chip. All right. Now that we've added in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.840
all the ingredients, next we got to use our&nbsp;
tray. We need to line them up on the tray&nbsp;

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.482
Theo: And what's that?
Vanessa: And what?&nbsp;

00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:04.960
Theo: And with that?
Vanessa: Oh, they scoop them out with that. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.200
know what, I was just thinking we could use this.
Theo: No.&nbsp;

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.360
Vanessa: Because this will make gigantic&nbsp;
cookies that might not cook very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:19.440
They might be kind of raw on the inside.&nbsp;
So it's good to use one little spoon.&nbsp;

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.800
Theo: No, do this one.
Vanessa: That giant... This one?&nbsp;

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.400
Theo: No, this one.
Vanessa: That one. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.720
That's a great idea. Why don't I put this a&nbsp;
little bit closer so you can get it over there.&nbsp;

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.320
Theo: Wow. Look at how big mineâ€™s gonna be!
Vanessa: Oh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.120
no. It says to keep them two inches apart&nbsp;
because these are going to kind of fluff up.&nbsp;

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.600
Theo: I'm going to make that big one.
Vanessa: That's going to be yours.&nbsp;

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.960
Theo: I am making lots of big ones.
Vanessa: Are you going to eat that one too? I bet.&nbsp;

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.440
Theo: Wow.
Vanessa: Wow. That might be a little big bud.&nbsp;

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.720
Theo: No.
Vanessa: Let's tone it down just a bit.&nbsp;

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.600
Theo: Just smash it down with my thing.
Vanessa: Well, I was thinking you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.440
break off a little piece.
Theo: No, smash.&nbsp;

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.160
Vanessa: Just smash it down. Well, let's see&nbsp;
what happens. Usually the first batch is kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.258
of an experiment anyway. All right.
Theo: I'm going to watch.&nbsp;

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:13.360
Vanessa: You going to watch? All&nbsp;
right. It's a good idea to stand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.400
back like that because the oven's really&nbsp;
hot. Thank you for doing that. All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.040
Okay. Now I got to turn on the timer.
Theo: I need some more wrapping paper.&nbsp;

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.240
Vanessa: Wrapping paper? Oh,&nbsp;
you mean the parchment paper?&nbsp;

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.760
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: Okay. Let's do that.&nbsp;

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:41.360
Theo: Now I'm making little fingerprints&nbsp;
in there to make a fingerprint.&nbsp;

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.960
Vanessa: Fingerprint cookies. Wow. I don't want&nbsp;
you to smush down all of these because the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.120
you touch it, probably the flatter and the harder&nbsp;
and the crispier they're going to be, and these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.065
are supposed to be fluffy and light cookies.
Theo: Look at this. I'm poking a hole in that one.&nbsp;

00:18:59.065 --> 00:19:02.240
Vanessa: Is that a volcano cookie?
Theo: Mm-hmm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.760
(affirmative). This is a volcano one too.
Vanessa: All right. Well, something we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:13.360
to get ready so that when the cookies are done, we&nbsp;
can eat. We can drink some milk with the cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.600
That's kind of a classic combination is you get&nbsp;
your chocolate chip cookie and you dunk it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.440
the milk. Have you ever done that before?
Theo: No. We can put some milk in a bowl.&nbsp;

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.816
Vanessa: In a bowl. Oh. Not a cup?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:34.240
Vanessa: Oh, we could do that too. All&nbsp;
right. I could put some in a bowl and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.940
then we can share it together.
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.600
Vanessa: Okay. Usually you put it&nbsp;
in a cup, but I'm up for a bowl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.240
Do you have a bowl on your shelf that we can use?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative). There's certainly lots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.120
of bowls. You got those two bowls.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.560
There are certainly lots of bowls.
Theo: Look, there's two bowls.&nbsp;

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.400
Vanessa: Two bowls. Certainly lots&nbsp;
of bowls. What was I thinking?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.235
You know what that is?
Theo: Cookies.&nbsp;

00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:09.600
Vanessa: Cookies. All right. I got to clean&nbsp;
out the drying rack or the cooling rack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.520
All right. I'm going to take them out of the oven.&nbsp;
You want to take a look and see if they're ready?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.520
All right, Theo. You know what? I think these&nbsp;
are not done. They need to be brown and crispy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.320
on the edges. So let's put them in for two more&nbsp;
minutes. All right. I heard the timer go off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.400
Let's check on our cookies.
Theo: And put these ones in.&nbsp;

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.320
Vanessa: Yep. You know what? Our cookies are&nbsp;
kind of bigger than what they called for,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.680
so let's just give it a try. I need you to step&nbsp;
back for a second. And can you pick up your book?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.360
Because I'm going to put&nbsp;
these cookies on this tray.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:53.760
I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but...
Theo: But mine are really big.&nbsp;

00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.400
Vanessa: Your cookies are ginormous. We're going&nbsp;
to get a bowl of milk. We're going to give them a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.240
try. Are you trying them with your fork? Can&nbsp;
you go get a bowl from your shelf, please?&nbsp;

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:12.080
Theo: I'm going to use that fork and a spoon.
Vanessa: Wow. Have you ever met a three-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.320
who eats chocolate chip cookies with a&nbsp;
fork and a spoon? I guess that's you.&nbsp;

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.120
Theo: And I just got it.
Vanessa: Oh, I got the milk right here.&nbsp;

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.520
Theo: Why? Did you get it already?
Vanessa: I got it ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.560
All right. Usually you dunk them in a&nbsp;
cup of milk, but you want to use a bowl?&nbsp;

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.080
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative). For these.
Vanessa: That's fine. We can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.200
share it together. All right. Can you choose&nbsp;
one cookie? Choose which one you want?&nbsp;

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.840
Theo: This one.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.040
That one? All right. I'm going to choose this one.
Theo: It's really big.&nbsp;

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.520
Vanessa: It is big. Oh, it's melting.&nbsp;
Chocolate chips melting on my fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:55.040
All right. I've poured in the&nbsp;
milk. Now, it's time to dunk them.&nbsp;

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:02.320
Theo: But we can't eat them here.
Vanessa: They are so fluffy.&nbsp;

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.040
Theo: Wow.
Vanessa: Wow. So that's your last cookie?&nbsp;

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.960
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: Okay. All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:15.760
I'm going to eat your little mini cookie.&nbsp;
Uh-oh. Whoa. It just jumped into the milk.&nbsp;

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.080
Theo: I can eat it.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.760
Wow. How's it taste?
Theo: Good.&nbsp;

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.680
Vanessa: I'm going to dip&nbsp;
this little mini cookie in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.080
That is great. Do you want to cheers our cookies?
Theo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).&nbsp;

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:46.000
Vanessa: Cheers.
Theo: Cookies and milk. That's the best.&nbsp;

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.920
Vanessa: Cookies and milk. That's the best.&nbsp;
That is right. Thank you so much for joining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.480
us on this baking adventure, all of the&nbsp;
ups and downs of baking with a toddler.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:03.760
And now I have a question for you. What kind of&nbsp;
cookies or desserts do you like? I hope you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:11.200
a chance to try out baking these cookies sometime&nbsp;
soon. It is extremely simple and fun and tasty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.760
Well, thank you so much for learning English with&nbsp;
me and I'll see you again next Friday for a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:25.360
lesson here on my YouTube channel. Bye.
Theo: I'm just touching it with my fork.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.200
This is really punching in with my fork.
Vanessa:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.600
Yeah, does that feel good?
Theo: I'm trying to see&nbsp;&nbsp;
