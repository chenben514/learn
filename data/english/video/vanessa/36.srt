00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.740
Hi I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.819
Would you like to learn English like a native
speaker?

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:08.819
Of course.

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:15.020
Let's talk about it.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.280
Would you like to see how my son, a native
English speaker is learning his native language?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.210
Today we're going to talk about three things
that happen naturally during conversations

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.330
with him that are helping him to learn to
speak English.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.600
And I'm curious, as you watch this video think
about mothers, and fathers in your country.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.690
Do they do these things as well?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.940
I have a son who just turned one year old.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.510
You're going to meet him in this lesson, and
he already knows how to say a couple things

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.500
like mama, dada, kitty, fish.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.810
Even though it sounds like ish, and ants even
though it sounds like nts.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.810
But he's learning a lot.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.610
He can even understand more words than he
can say.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.900
Maybe that's similar to you.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.130
Can you understand more than you can say?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.900
He can understand words like milk, food, lets
go, give it to me, hurray.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.700
You know all of those important words.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.509
Over the next year he's going to learn a lot
more words.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.171
He's going to learn how to say them, he's
going to learn how to understand them, but

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.549
how is he actually going to learn them?

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.140
Well at the moment we read a lot of books
with him, I tell him stories as we walk through

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.259
the neighborhood, and he hears my husband
and I talking together a lot.

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.759
But these are things that a lot of you do.

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.499
Maybe you read stories, you listen to stories.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.359
So what are some things that are unique to
babies?

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.649
Lets talk about three of those things today.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.619
We're going to watch a short clip where I'm
going for a walk around our lawn, and I'm

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.950
just talking to my son about things that are
happening.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.090
We do this every morning, and in the video
it was 7:00 AM, he had just woken up, but

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.649
we were still having an interaction, a conversation
together.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.479
Let's watch this clip, and then we're going
to break it down into those three elements.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.389
Do you see the ants Theo?

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:11.180
Yeah, they're on that tree.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.860
They're climbing up.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.689
Where do you think they're going?

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.220
Yeah, maybe their little home?

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220
What happens when you pull on that tree Theo?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.610
Oh, the leaf fell on the ground.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.010
The whole branch moves huh?

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.099
Whoa.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.420
That looks like fun.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.150
Yeah, are you going to tell me about it?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.319
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.400
Okay.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.239
Oh, I can't let you eat that leaf.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.040
I know it looks tasty.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.870
It probably won't feel too god inside of you.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.219
Yeah, that one too.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.790
Oh, it's on the ground.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.799
Maybe we can go eat some breakfast?

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:19.799
That's something you can eat.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.799
Would you like some breakfast?

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.799
Yeah?

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:22.799
Let's go look over here.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.799
There's so many things to explore outside.

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.080
Do you want to touch this one?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080
Whoa.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.290
You got some leaves off of that branch.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.819
And then the gate.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.220
What do you see?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.969
Oh, do you hear that air conditioning over
there?

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.599
I know, I hear it too.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.810
The first thing that people do when they're
interacting with babies, and speaking with

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.810
them is they ask a lot of questions.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.349
I've found myself doing this, and I've also
noticed other people I know when they interact

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.859
with my baby, if they're a parent, if they're
not a parent they ask questions.

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.480
And I wonder why we do this?

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.010
I think it's maybe because he is curious,
and he is engaging with the world around him,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.780
and we want to be part of that.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.040
We want to engage, and be curious with him,
"What do you see?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040
Do you see that?

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040
What's that?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.330
What are you doing?"

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.950
We're engaging with him, and we're using his
natural curiosity in order to learn more language.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.310
So I think that you can use this as well as
an English learner.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.890
Spark your curiosity about the things around
you.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.600
Look at the room around you, look outside
if you're outside at the moment, and try to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.330
ask questions about things, "What's that noise?

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.380
Oh, is that the air conditioning?"

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.640
And maybe you don't know the word for air
conditioning in English, or you can't pronounce

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640
it well.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.530
This is a good time to use that word, to practice,
and to engage yourself in the world around

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.600
you by asking questions about things that
are just natural in your world.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.380
The second thing that adults often do when
they talk with babies is use baby talk.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.290
And this means that your vowels are elongated,
and your pitch usually goes up.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.730
Sometimes your emotions are just really obvious.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.740
They're even exaggerated, and we use this
for babies almost universally.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.660
I think a lot of countries use baby talk when
talking with babies.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.970
Let's take a look at a quick clip so that
you can hear this in action, and then we'll

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.970
talk about it.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.530
Do you see the ants Theo?

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.340
Yeah, they're on that tree.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.230
They're climbing up.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.460
I said, "Yeah, they're on that tree.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.510
They're climbing up."

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.930
But I didn't say it like that.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.490
I said it in a little bit [inaudible 00:05:47]
higher pitch, and I elongated some vowels

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.490
naturally.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.310
I wasn't thinking, "I should elongate these
vowels so that my son can understand me clearly."

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.460
No, this is just something that naturally
happens, "they're on that tree."

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.120
Those vowels are elongated to help him understand
more clearly.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.371
And there was actually a study that showed
people who talk to babies in baby talk, those

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:16.590
babies understood their native language faster,
because they were spoken to clearly, and they

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.760
could hear those vowels, which are often the
most tricky parts of language.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.900
So for you, how can this help you as an English
learner?

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.320
Should you listen to mothers speaking in baby
talk?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.860
No, not necessarily.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.410
But what this translates to for you is that
it's best to start off with something that

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.420
you can understand.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.620
So for example, this English lesson I hope
that you can understand the majority of what

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.620
I'm saying.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.950
My speech just naturally is pretty clear,
and straightforward.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.200
This means it's easier to understand.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.930
So start with this kind of speech.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.540
Don't jump right into an English TV show,
and then feel overwhelmed, and bored.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.090
Instead start with something that you can
understand.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.390
Babies start with baby talk, and then they
work up to more mature, adult-like speech.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.530
So don't feel bad starting with something
a little bit lower level, and then working

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.520
your way to eventually watching English movies.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.500
The third thing that adults often do when
they're speaking with babies is they interact

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.340
with them by talking back to them when they're
babbling.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.700
Babbling means when they're just saying nonsense.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.700
It's just sounds.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.410
Yaya, nana, mama, lala.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:31.060
It means nothing, but adults are interacting
with them and saying, "Oh yeah, what are you

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.060
saying?"

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.450
Or they're giving a toy, or they're showing
that they're listening.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.940
And this is something that's really valuable
to babies because it's encouraging them to

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.350
speak even though it's nothingness, it doesn't
mean anything.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.920
They're learning step-by-step to speak.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.230
Now let me just say it was really hard to
capture any of my sons sounds on camera, because

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.800
the moment he sees something new like my phone
he wants to grab it, and then he stops babbling.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.330
So what we have in this clip is about as good
as it gets, but let's take a look at it really

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.750
quick just to see that kind of sounds, more
like mmmm sounds that he's making, and how

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.730
I'm interacting with him.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.750
That looks like fun.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.090
Yeah, are you going to tell me about it?

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.490
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.490
Okay.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.330
Having someone to talk to is so much more
fun than just speaking by yourself.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.400
So I'd like to help you use this technique
as well.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.250
Even if you're just saying sounds like my
baby, it doesn't mean anything.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.930
I recommend checking out this video I recently
did about how to learn to speak English in

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.990
your home country without moving to another
place.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.720
You can do it, check out that link so that
you can get a bunch of tips to help you start

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.140
speaking today.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.900
And now I have a question for you.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.340
Do mothers, and fathers in your country use
these techniques when they're speaking with

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.490
babies?

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.450
Maybe your parents used this when you were
baby as well.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.840
You can use them now.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.130
Be curious, learn with information you can
understand, and speak.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.810
Have that joyful confidence, that innocence
like a child, and use the language that you

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:09.810
know.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.440
Thanks so much for learning with me, and I'll
see you again next Friday for a new lesson

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.050
