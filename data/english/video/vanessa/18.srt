00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.790
Vanessa:
Hi. I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.860
Dan:
And I'm Dan, her husband and partner and assistant.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.050
Vanessa:
Yes, game expert.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.839
Dan:
Oh, and game expert.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.990
Vanessa:
Today we're going to be playing a fun game

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.430
called Codenames: Duet. There's a regular
Codenames, but we're going to be playing the

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.660
one that's meant for two people. During this
game, we're going to be talking out loud and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.380
trying to explain why we're doing what we're
doing, so I hope that you're going to be able

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.840
to catch some real vocabulary, real phrasal
verbs. I'm going to try to explain the game

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.650
just a little bit, but overall, I hope that
your goal for this video is to learn some

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.760
natural vocabulary and next week in the YouTube
video, I'm going to be explaining some of

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.590
these words in more detail. So if you saw
a word that you thought was interesting, don't

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.840
worry. Next week, hopefully we'll talk about
it in more detail. Are you ready to get started?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.170
Dan:
I'm ready. Let's do it.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.230
Vanessa:
Okay. Let's go. Just to give a general overview

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.470
of how to play this game, we have this little
key card here and-

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.750
Dan:
Don't show me.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.280
Vanessa:
Yes. Dan sees one side. I see the other and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.150
it's... I'll show you here on the screen.
I'm trying to get Dan to guess the green words

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.980
on my side and he's trying to get me to guess
his green words and we don't want each other

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.030
to guess our black words. Those are the bomb
words.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.810
Dan:
Yeah. We have a whole legion of words here

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.820
and some of them are the correct words that
we need to guess. And I don't know what her

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.229
side says and she doesn't know what my side
says.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.229
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.920
Dan:
So we're going to try to give each other a

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.630
one word hint to guess the right word or the
word we're trying to think of.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.890
Vanessa:
Yeah. You'll pick it up.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.520
Dan:
And actually... Yeah. It's better if you try

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.950
to give a hint for multiple words which I'm
guessing Vanessa is going to do because she's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.040
pretty smart.
Vanessa:

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.990
Oh, well, thank you. So we're just going to
play the game and you can try to pick it up

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.072
along the way. I've already set out the-
Dan:

00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:02.200
Just watch. You'll learn.
Vanessa:

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.369
I already set out the cards so we're ready
to go.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.369
Dan:
Oh.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.080
Vanessa:
Okay. I kind of gave myself a little piece

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.950
of paper where I wrote down some hints. These
are all of my words, just so I can visually

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.880
see them together. My first word for you,
it's a big one. Are you ready? It is Gouda.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.620
Dan:
Gouda.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.441
Vanessa:
Three. So that means Gouda, if you know what

00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.879
Gouda is, I can't say anything else about
that word.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.879
Dan:
Yeah.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.879
Vanessa:
But Gouda-

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:33.879
Dan:
Gouda is a cheese.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.720
Vanessa:
And three means there are three cards here

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.700
on the table that relate to that word. Some
of them might be closely related, some of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.970
them might be a stretch, but I hope that Dan
guesses them correctly.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.510
Dan:
Right. And I have to touch them for it to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.510
be official.
Vanessa:

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.510
Yes.
Dan:

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.550
so I'm allowed to just speak about what I'm
thinking.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.550
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.340
Dan:
Well, Gouda is a cheese and cheese as a word

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.650
down here.
Vanessa:

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.650
Yep.
Dan:

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.820
Oftentimes cheese comes in a wheel.
Vanessa:

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.820
Oh.
Dan:

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.489
There's a wheel. It's made in a kitchen. It
resembles a clock.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.330
Vanessa:
Okay. That could be a stretch.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.800
Dan:
I think Gouda is smoky. Usually it's a smoky

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.709
Gouda. Let's see. That's all I got so far.
Vanessa:

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.700
The hard part is that if he says the wrong
word or if he says the right word, I can't

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.690
give a facial expression that hints-
Dan:

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.990
I'm going to definitely touch cheese.
Vanessa:

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.000
All right. That's correct.
Dan:

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.739
Because that's obvious.
Vanessa:

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.269
So when that's correct, we put one of these
on it?

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.269
Dan:
That one.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.269
Vanessa:
We put this one on it.

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.269
Dan:
Yeah.

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.090
Vanessa:
Okay, so that means that this word is finished.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.770
All right. I'm going to mark it off on my
paper.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.590
Dan:
And let's see. Trying to make sure I'm not

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.190
missing something obvious. She probably thinks
I am.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.310
Vanessa:
I can't give any hint with my face-

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.310
Dan:
Well...

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.310
Vanessa:
Which is really hard.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.500
Dan:
I'm going to go with... Maybe this game will

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.569
end right now.
Vanessa:

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.000
If he touches a black word, then it means
the game is instantly over.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.670
Dan:
Smoked Gouda.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.921
Vanessa:
Ding, ding, ding. Because you also have to

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:14.180
think a strategy for this game is, "Why did
I say Gouda and not Brie, not cheddar cheese?

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.630
Why did I specifically choose Gouda?" Thereâ€™s
a reason.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.699
Dan:
Now I feel like it's either wheel or kitchen

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:28.569
because, well, cheese comes in a wheel. You
call it a cheese wheel. You call it a cheese

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.569
wheel.
Vanessa:

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.999
Don't make me make a facial expression, I
can't give it away.

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.999
Dan:
Wheel.

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.379
Vanessa:
You got it. Wow. I think that was the best

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:41.740
first word that I've ever said because all
three of those were related to Gouda.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.809
Dan:
Oh, and you take one of these check marks

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:44.809
and your turn is done.
Vanessa:

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:45.809
Oh, right. I got a check mark.
Dan:

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.499
In the single player... Oh, wait. Two player
version.

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.300
Vanessa:
Yeah. In this game, we're trying to beat the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.110
game, so we're hoping to have everything finished
by the time these little cards are finished.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.909
It's not too important to explain that part.
Dan:

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:58.909
Okay.
Vanessa:

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.039
All right. Do you have a hint for me?
Dan:

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.770
I'm ready. Your hint is star, two.
Vanessa:

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:13.689
All right, so two words here are related to
star. Well, a star has five points, so it

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:20.879
could be a pentagon, street star, kitchen
clock, rice, army, blacksmith, dentist, fever,

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.990
fog, Earth, penny.
Dan:

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.749
As she says every single one.
Vanessa:

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:29.240
Big bang. Oh, stars were created in the big
bang.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.319
Dan:
Were they though?

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.180
Vanessa:
Some country stars.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.979
Dan:
Was the big bang even real? I don't know.

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.930
Vanessa:
Some country stars come from Texas. That's

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.800
a little bit of a stretch. Butterfly... Okay,
I'm going to go with pentagon. Are you serious?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.990
Dan:
No. Sort of... Oh, good. But it's just one

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.050
of these.
Vanessa:

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.599
Okay. So if this were a black word on his
side, that means the game would be immediately

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.169
over and we would lose.
Dan:

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.169
Pentagon?
Vanessa:

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.400
Yeah, the pentagon because-
Dan:

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.589
I was just thinking the building.
Vanessa:

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:04.999
Well, yeah, but this is outside the box.
Dan:

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.120
I forgot that that means five points.
Vanessa:

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.020
Okay. Even though he said two words, I can't
guess the second word because I got the first

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.020
one wrong.
Dan:

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.020
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.020
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Dan:

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.749
So that counts as a turn. We only have nine
turns. We're trying to finish in nine terms.

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:21.749
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.300
Dan:
But I mean we got a lot in your first one,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.300
so.
Vanessa:

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.559
Okay. All right. Now it's my turn to tell
you a word. Well, I already have another word

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:28.559
ready.
Dan:

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:29.849
Another word or another hint?
Vanessa:

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:30.849
Another hint.
Dan:

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:31.849
Another hint.
Vanessa:

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:32.960
I have another hint. Ready?
Dan:

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960
Okay.
Vanessa:

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.139
Let me make sure that it's not going to clash
with any of the other words.

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.270
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.149
Vanessa:
Okay. Are you ready?

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.279
Dan:
I'm ready.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.830
Vanessa:
Okay. My hint... I don't feel as certain about

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.979
this one.
Dan:

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.240
Oh, boy.
Vanessa:

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.899
My hint is bike, two.
Dan:

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:52.139
Two, bikes.
Vanessa:

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:58.159
There are two words that relate to bike. Hopefully,
you also think that.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.409
Dan:
Well, some dentists in foreign countries ride

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:12.849
bikes to work but not in America. And we're
in America, so impossible. Bikes have gears.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:22.659
That's pretty obvious. Bikes go on the street.
Bikes ride to the Pentagon and Columbus too.

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:25.909
Vanessa:
I hear that Joan of Arc also rode a bike.

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:30.939
Dan:
Or maybe that's Christopher Columbus. He definitely

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:34.720
didn't have a bike so I'm going to start out
with gear.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.159
Vanessa:
Good work.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.610
Dan:
That's easy.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.309
Vanessa:
All right. We got gear and you have one more

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:44.629
guess because you got that correct.
Dan:

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:53.190
Oh, oh, helmet. Duh. So probably the tough
thing is between helmet and street. I associate

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.529
a helmet more with the bike because, well,
you always ride the bike on the street, but

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:01.129
helmet...
Vanessa:

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:04.382
You can also ride a bike on a path, on a trail.
Dan:

00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:05.382
Right. Yeah, I know.
Vanessa:

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:06.382
I was hoping you had seen that.
Dan:

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:07.800
I didn't even see it the first time.
Vanessa:

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.710
All right. Good work. So you got all of these.
Dan:

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.839
As you can tell, this game can break up relationships.
Vanessa:

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:15.239
We're doing okay so far.
Dan:

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:19.349
We're fine so far. I'm a little angry at the
moment about pentagon.

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:22.069
Vanessa:
That you forgot that that has five points?

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:24.699
Dan:
Yeah. Actually that was my fault anyways.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:26.789
Vanessa:
Now it's your turn to think of a hint for

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:29.169
me. Do you have a hint ready for me?
Dan:

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:30.169
I have a hint ready.
Vanessa:

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:31.169
Okay.
Dan:

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:36.829
And I'm going to try to make it easy. It's
lame of me to do this, but sushi, one.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:39.180
Vanessa:
Oh.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.729
Dan:
Just one.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:41.729
Vanessa:
Well...

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.250
Dan:
But she can make additional guesses after

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.170
this because she didn't get the last one.
Vanessa:

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:52.730
Yeah, I'm going to go with, there's both rice
and kitchen on the table, but I feel like

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.839
rice is a lot more specific. You would have
said something else if it was actually kitchen.

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:59.470
So I'm going to click...
Dan:

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.470
Click.
Vanessa:

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.660
Touch rice.
Dan:

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.660
Rice.
Vanessa:

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.171
Okay, so now because I got-
Dan:

00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:05.171
You got it.
Vanessa:

00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:10.440
All of yours correct, I'm going to continue
to guess the ones that I missed last time.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440
Dan:
Okay.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.709
Vanessa:
Your hint was star, two so I'm going to go

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:24.170
with big bang, and I'm pretty sure it's Earth,
but I'm going to take a look around because

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:35.850
pentagon was not right. Yeah, I think that's
probably the closest thing to star. No.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:44.529
Dan:
What? Earth is not a star.

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:49.610
Vanessa:
Well, Earth is in outer space. It's a astronomical

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:50.610
body.
Dan:

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.550
See why this breaks up relationships?
Vanessa:

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:59.090
When you don't understand each other. Okay,
so we only used up two wrong guesses. So we

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:06.560
have five more turns to get everything correct
for star. I guess we could say Joan of Arc

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.639
was a star. That's kind of weird. Okay. Anyway,
it's my turn.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.639
Dan:
Okay.

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:13.970
Vanessa:
Okay. Are you ready for my next hint?

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.970
Dan:
I'm ready.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.900
Vanessa:
I'm a little worried about this one.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.290
Dan:
Hey, so far your signals to me have been very

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.290
clear.
Vanessa:

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.290
Okay, well-
Dan:

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.290
Mine, not so much.
Vanessa:

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:30.660
I hope that this helps. As the game gets goes
along further, there's less words and so it's

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.970
harder to combine them. I'll cut out when
I edit this video, the time that it takes

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.160
to think about words.
Dan:

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:46.779
It takes a long time to think of a hint.
Vanessa:

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:59.430
Yeah. My next hint is... Let me make sure.
Double check... Nature, two.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.279
Dan:
That's an easy enough word.

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:02.279
Vanessa:
Yeah, I think-

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:03.279
Dan:
There's nature everywhere.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.570
Vanessa:
That's the problem. Nature is such a broad

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.200
word, but I chose it.
Dan:

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:17.470
Oh, all right. Well, nothing's seriously jumping
out at me except for butterfly. Butterflies

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:33.959
are par of nature. Fog is a kind of nature.
I mean it's in nature. Napoleon is a freak

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:45.720
of nature. Zombies are also freaks of nature.
Natural. I'm going to go with butterfly first.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.230
Vanessa:
Good work.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.819
Dan:
And geez, I don't know about this next one

00:11:51.819 --> 00:12:00.510
though. Well, Earth. Okay. Earth was neutral
for me so maybe it's not for you. Oh, wait,

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.960
no. Yes.
Vanessa:

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.389
Yeah. Earth was neutral for you.
Dan:

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:07.389
Okay.
Vanessa:

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:08.749
That's why you put this on it.
Dan:

00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:15.980
Okay. I'm going to say you probably are not
thinking of fog the way I am, so I'm going

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.089
to touch Earth.
Vanessa:

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:18.089
No.
Dan:

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:19.920
It's not an assassin?
Vanessa:

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920
No.
Dan:

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.940
It's neutral?
Vanessa:

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.940
It is neutral.
Dan:

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.339
Double neutrals, so we're okay.
Vanessa:

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:26.499
Okay. So that means you have to put another
little tab on there.

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:27.499
Dan:
Yeah, I guess so.

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:29.589
Vanessa:
And we lose one of our turns.

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:31.650
Dan:
Actually, you could put a check mark because

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.480
we got one. It already has it on there.
Vanessa:

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.819
Okay. So the next time around, if you get
all of my hints, you'll get an extra guess

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:43.449
and you could potentially guess the final
nature words.

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:46.399
Dan:
Yeah, but Earth is very natural.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.439
Vanessa:
Well, I can't say anything.

00:12:49.439 --> 00:12:50.439
Dan:
You can't say anything.

00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:51.439
Vanessa:
Nope.

00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:54.550
Dan:
See, this is where the couple's tension comes

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.550
in.
Vanessa:

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.389
I don't feel any tension.
Dan:

00:12:57.389 --> 00:13:00.079
Oh, neither do I. No tension whatsoever.
Vanessa:

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.699
All right. It's your turn to think of a hint
for me.

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:04.420
Dan:
All right. My next hint is amount.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.320
Vanessa:
Amount. Okay.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.990
Dan:
It's a little vague.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.990
Vanessa:
Yes.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.110
Dan:
Oh, amount, two... Forgot that part.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.279
Vanessa:
Oh, there's two words.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:16.899
Dan:
Yes.

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:22.290
Vanessa:
Okay. Well, I feel like the people are out,

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:38.310
so not Columbus, not Napoleon, not Joan of
Arc, not blacksmith or dentist. Texas, stable,

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:51.499
amount. There's a large amount of zombies.
We could use penny to say like, "What's the

00:13:51.499 --> 00:14:01.889
amount of money you need?" Or, "What's the
amount?" I feel like if we're talking about

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:12.930
measurements amounts... You have to measure
if you have a fever. You also could say there's

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:19.980
an amount on a clock maybe. That's a little
bit of a stretch. All right. I'm going to

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:27.490
start with penny. I'm scared. I got one. All
right. There's another one that has an amount.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:36.370
Well, there's an amount on the thermometer.
A temperature is an amount. I don't feel like

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.260
clock is stronger than fever. Fever.
Dan:

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.850
Ding, ding, ding.
Vanessa:

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.779
Yes. Okay. So if I-
Dan:

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:47.050
Are you going to make any additional guesses?
Vanessa:

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:53.550
If I have not yet guessed star, your second
star word, I can guess it now. I haven't guessed

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.309
it yet? It's still available?
Dan:

00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:57.940
Yes, it's still available.
Vanessa:

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:07.100
Oh, boy. Stark. Come on. Tell... You use stars
for an astronomical clock.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.660
Dan:
This will not make sense to your students

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.660
either.
Vanessa:

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.660
Really?
Dan:

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.519
Oh. Well, that might be a hint. I don't know.
Vanessa:

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:19.089
How is it make sense to me then? Okay.
Dan:

00:15:19.089 --> 00:15:22.730
I thought you understood me.
Vanessa:

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:29.120
Do you understand what I would choose as star
such as pentagon and Earth? No.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.480
Dan:
I get that.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480
Vanessa:
I've never-

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.860
Dan:
That was just a miss by me. Earth, I don't

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.860
get that.
Vanessa:

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.809
In this game, I have never missed a word twice
like that. I don't think...

00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:41.939
Dan:
Well, then look harder.

00:15:41.939 --> 00:15:44.430
Vanessa:
That's what I'm doing. You know what? I think

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.430
I might pass.
Dan:

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.430
You're going to pass? Okay.
Vanessa:

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.300
We have four more tokens left, so I feel like
we're pretty safe.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.589
Dan:
Check mark.

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:52.529
Vanessa:
And now it's my turn to give you a hint.

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:53.529
Dan:
Okay.

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:54.970
Vanessa:
Maybe our words will overlap. I don't know.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.389
Dan:
Are you ready? Or do you need a minute?

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:58.680
Vanessa:
I need a minute.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.680
Dan:
She needs a minute.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.680
Vanessa:
Are you ready?

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.680
Dan:
I'm ready.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.139
Vanessa:
All right. I have my next hint and it's simple

00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:09.879
as in it's just one word, but I'm going to
say... Let me make sure. Let me make sure

00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:12.269
it is martyr, one.
Dan:

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:13.629
Martyr?
Vanessa:

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:16.350
Martyr... Too simple.
Dan:

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:24.660
Who's the martyr? Definitely Columbus, savior
of the planet of North America.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.779
Vanessa:
Killer of millions of people.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:30.899
Dan:
Oh, wait. Wrong martyr. Joan of Arc.

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:33.459
Vanessa:
Yes. You got it outright.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:37.040
Dan:
Okay. Just for drama's sake, I'm just going

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.319
to give you one hint and see if you can get
my star.

00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:41.470
Vanessa:
No.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.940
Dan:
My star... Your hint is time, one.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.869
Vanessa:
Okay. Well, it's got to be clock.

00:16:47.869 --> 00:16:50.329
Dan:
Oh, touch it.

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:52.170
Vanessa:
Oh, no.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.899
Dan:
So I guess we lose if you don't get this,

00:16:55.899 --> 00:17:02.160
right? Oh, no, no. Oh, I think in the rules
you get a Hail Mary guess at the end.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160
Vanessa:
Oh, yeah?

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.100
Dan:
Yeah. There's one Hail Mary guess at the end.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.100
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.850
Dan:
I'll double check after this, but-

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.620
Vanessa:
So you would get that guess?

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.100
Dan:
I'm not sure.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.919
Vanessa:
Because actually I have two words... I said

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:17.600
I had one word before, but I have two words.
One is a new word that I've never given a

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.549
hint for and one's a word that you missed
before. Oh, star. Okay. Well...

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:24.000
Dan:
Oh, star.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.649
Vanessa:
I would personally not say that Christopher

00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:33.100
Columbus is a star. I would consider that
more someone who is a pop star and Columbus,

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:43.559
he was a discover, an explorer. He's a pretty
bad guy, in my opinion, so I would not say

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:49.049
he's a star, but we'll leave it on the table.
Texas, the flag has a giant star in the middle

00:17:49.049 --> 00:18:00.010
of it. The flag of Texas has a star. Stable...
Some stars are stable, some stars explode.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:06.500
A stable can also be a place where horses
are, which is not related to star. Zombie...

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.300
I feel like zombies are not related to stars.
Dan:

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.649
You don't have to go over every single one.
Vanessa:

00:18:10.649 --> 00:18:13.830
Well, I've missed this twice. I've never done
this poorly before which is-

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.360
Dan:
Look at the ones you think are plausible.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.240
Vanessa:
Napoleon. Well, I got to think about what

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.130
you think too, because I've obviously missed
from thinking about it from my perspective.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:31.140
What would Dan think is star? Napoleon? Does
Dan think Napoleon is a star? I'm going to

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:43.549
say no. Does Dan think that fog... You can
see the stars through the fog. Huh? Huh? Army...

00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:51.919
I think the Army symbol is a star. The U.S.
Army has a star on their advertising and stuff,

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:57.500
but you might not know that. Maybe you do.
Blacksmith... Blacksmiths could make iron

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.649
stars and put them on the wall. I don't know.
Dan:

00:19:00.649 --> 00:19:02.850
She's reaching.
Vanessa:

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:13.929
Dentists. It's kitchen star. No, street star.
No, star street. Kitchen street. Kitchen star.

00:19:13.929 --> 00:19:30.149
Okay. So in my mind it's between Texas has
a star on their flag or Columbus. Maybe you

00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:39.640
think Columbus was a star even though I don't.
Okay. My final guests is Texas because Texas'

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.390
nickname is the Lone Star State.
Dan:

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.679
Gotta touch it.
Vanessa:

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:47.120
I don't know why that would have been the
first star.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.020
Dan:
Touch it. Touch it. Yes. It's not the first

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.120
star. Big bang was the first star.
Vanessa:

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.120
Yeah.
Dan:

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.149
Sorry. Texas is associated with stars.
Vanessa:

00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:58.149
More than-
Dan:

00:19:58.149 --> 00:20:02.930
The Lone Star State, it's got a big star on
it. The sports team's name is the Stars.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.769
Vanessa:
More than the pentagon? More than Earth is

00:20:06.769 --> 00:20:08.830
in space with stars?
Dan:

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.580
Absolutely, more than Earth.
Vanessa:

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.360
We'll let the judges decide.
Dan:

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.520
Well, in this American mind.
Vanessa:

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.520
Okay.
Dan:

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.520
But you're American.
Vanessa:

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.570
Well, I was thinking more universally.
Dan:

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.020
She's a citizen of the world.
Vanessa:

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.140
Of the universe... I apparently am. Does that
mean you get another token?

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.140
Dan:
Oh, yes.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.220
Vanessa:
All right, so we have one left.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.650
Dan:
Oh, and mine are done.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.130
Vanessa:
Yours are all finished. So I have two that

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.290
you need to guess. All right. Are you ready
for my final hint?

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.210
Dan:
The drama.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.029
Vanessa:
Yes. It is-

00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:46.250
Dan:
Beer for two.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.700
Vanessa:
No. Five for one.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.760
Dan:
Five for one?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.340
Dan:
Oh, okay. And then my bonus guess is nature.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.570
Okay. Okay. So you're doing it that way.
Vanessa:

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.700
Yes.
Dan:

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.110
Okay. Okay. It's five, one?
Vanessa:

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.010
Maybe. Yeah, I guess I can't take it back,
right?

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.010
Dan:
Five.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.950
Vanessa:
A little bit of pressure because there's only

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.360
one guest left.
Dan:

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.360
Five.
Vanessa:

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.950
Are we going to lose?
Dan:

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.950
Oh.
Vanessa:

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.190
Thank you.
Dan:

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.190
Pentagon.
Vanessa:

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.190
Pentagon.
Dan:

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.220
Oh, the dramatic word.
Vanessa:

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.809
All right. But there is-
Dan:

00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:21.809
Nature.
Vanessa:

00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:24.340
One more that you need to say.
Dan:

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:30.299
That's not Earth. I mean, is it fog?
Vanessa:

00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:31.610
Are you pointing to it?
Dan:

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.610
No.
Vanessa:

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.610
This is the final guess.
Dan:

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.610
It couldn't be-
Vanessa:

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.630
If you guess the wrong one, we lose the game.
Dan:

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.330
Nothing... No, we don't. We get the one more
guess.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.220
Vanessa:
Oh, you get one more guess?

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.380
Dan:
You get a bonus guess.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.380
Vanessa:
Oh, you get a-

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.380
Dan:
Yeah.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.380
Vanessa:
Okay. We're fine. We're good.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.380
Dan:
Well, I'll go ahead and touch fog.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.700
Vanessa:
Yes.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.560
Dan:
We win.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.900
Vanessa:
Hurray.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.670
Dan:
Only mildly dramatic.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.100
Vanessa:
Star. Yeah, so I said fog.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.100
Dan:
Fog.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.419
Vanessa:
Fog and butterfly where nature to me.

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:03.390
Dan:
Yeah. It makes sense, but for some reason,

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.070
fog just doesn't hit me as... But it is nature.
Vanessa:

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:10.010
Yeah, it was really hard to combine fog and
butterfly. I was thinking air, flying...

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.000
Dan:
No. That was good.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.169
Vanessa:
Something in the air, but then Earth is also

00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:14.679
very nature.
Dan:

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:19.190
I mean when I actually look at everything...
Yeah. Earth, was a little more nature to me.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.519
Vanessa:
Yeah. That's a little hard.

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:21.650
Dan:
I mean it was a toss up.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.490
Vanessa:
Yeah, I feel like if it were butterfly and

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.030
Earth I probably would have said a different
word.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.370
Dan:
Because we say Mother Earth for nature, so

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.840
it kind of made me think of Earth more than
fog.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.110
Vanessa:
Yeah. Well, in the end, we won. Good game.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.390
Dan:
Congratulations. Good job.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.159
Vanessa:
Yes. Okay. We're going to do a second round.

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.590
That means we have new words-
Dan:

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.590
Round two.
Vanessa:

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:48.529
Which you can see here and we have a new little
secret code word card that you'll be able

00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:52.920
to see here. I'm going to try to get Dan to
guess my words. He's going to try to get me

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920
to guess his words.
Dan:

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.920
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa:

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.080
Same as before. Maybe you'll learn some new
vocabulary. I hope so.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.130
Dan:
Well, let's find out. Well, I have the first

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.130
hint.
Vanessa:

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:02.130
Okay.
Dan:

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.130
And it is three.
Vanessa:

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.399
Oh, three. Okay.
Dan:

00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:06.370
Yes. The word is breakfast.
Vanessa:

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.370
Breakfast?
Dan:

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.370
Breakfast, three.
Vanessa:

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.370
Al right.
Dan:

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.570
Is that one word? I guess it is. Yes.
Vanessa:

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.050
Breakfast is certainly one word.
Dan:

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.780
It's breakfast... Break fast.
Vanessa:

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:21.830
Yeah, you're breaking the fast. Well, I'm
going to say milk and toast are looking pretty

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:31.020
good... Maybe tea. I drink tea in the morning,
part of my breakfast. Those three are looking

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.320
pretty good. Is there anything I'm missing
here? I can't look at your face-

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.320
Dan:
Kung fu.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.720
Vanessa:
Because you're going to give me some hints.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.200
Everyone does kung fu in the morning, right?
Dan:

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.380
We do.
Vanessa:

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.580
Maybe there is an avalanche before breakfast
and you just wear your bikini to breakfast.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.230
Dan:
How about an avalanche of cereal?

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.019
Vanessa:
Okay. All right. I'm going to start with toast.

00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:53.159
Dan:
Milk, toast.

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:56.299
Vanessa:
Oh, I didn't say milk, but yes. Milk.

00:23:56.299 --> 00:23:57.780
Dan:
Oh, I know.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.780
Vanessa:
Okay, good.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.830
Dan:
There's the saying, "Milk toast." It's a comment.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.830
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.830
Dan:
It's the thing people say nowadays.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:03.830
Vanessa:
Really?

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.000
Dan:
Yeah. It means boring. Plain.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.929
Vanessa:
Oh, I've never heard that.

00:24:06.929 --> 00:24:07.929
Dan:
Yeah.

00:24:07.929 --> 00:24:10.149
Vanessa:
Well, learn something new every day. Next,

00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:12.710
I get three for breakfast?
Dan:

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.590
If you want to.
Vanessa:

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:21.549
I do. I would feel pretty good about tea.
Sleep might potentially be one. You're waking

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:26.320
up from your sleep and you eat breakfast,
but I'm going to go with tea.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.960
Dan:
Sleeping for breakfast?

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.370
Vanessa:
Well, I don't know if you thought about tea

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.870
as a breakfast item.
Dan:

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.960
You don't know if I thought, period.
Vanessa:

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.909
All right. I'm ready with my first hit.
Dan:

00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:37.909
Okay.
Vanessa:

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:39.559
It is leg.
Dan:

00:24:39.559 --> 00:24:40.559
Leg.
Vanessa:

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:41.559
Two.
Dan:

00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:42.850
Two legs?
Vanessa:

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.659
Interpret it however you want.
Dan:

00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:49.570
Leg, two. Well, I do have two legs.
Vanessa:

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.570
Good.
Dan:

00:24:50.570 --> 00:25:00.830
My boss has legs. Legs kick. You have to have
pants and a tuxedo.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.640
Vanessa:
For your legs?

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.549
Dan:
Yeah, you put your legs in your pants.

00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:07.950
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.889
Dan:
Reindeer have legs. People who wear bikinis

00:25:11.889 --> 00:25:13.679
have legs.
Vanessa:

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:16.539
Not necessary though.
Dan:

00:25:16.539 --> 00:25:26.230
Let's see. Oh, okay. Kick is definitely jumping
out at me. Kung Fu, maybe. Those are related.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:35.580
Too many things have legs, Honey. Frogs. Frogs
have legs. Okay. I'm going to start out with

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.610
kick.
Vanessa:

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.169
Great work.
Dan:

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:40.070
But after that, I'm not certain-
Vanessa:

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.500
You can always pass. You don't have to say
the last one.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:50.269
Dan:
Boxers punch, but kick boxers kick with their

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:58.160
legs. I'm going to go ahead... Step. I didn't
even see that one, step. You step with your

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.110
legs... Well, your feet, really. There's too
many... I'm going to pass.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.170
Vanessa:
Oh, okay. All right.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.730
Dan:
I'm scared. Last time made me nervous.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.350
Vanessa:
All right, so you're going to have one waiting.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.919
Dan:
It's early on. Yeah, I don't know. To me,

00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:18.470
kung fu, step... I mean spurs... Well, they
go on your feet.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.669
Vanessa:
Yeah. Leg...

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:21.000
Dan:
Let, it's too vague.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Dan:
Leg is vague.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.970
Vanessa:
Yes, to be honest, it is a very vague word,

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.620
but that's what I said so it's your turn.
Dan:

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.980
All right. I'm ready and I have another triple
hint.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.200
Vanessa:
Whoa. Okay.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.929
Dan:
So might be... I can't say anymore. The word

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:39.460
is punch, three.
Vanessa:

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.460
Punch.
Dan:

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.830
Punch. punch. Punch. All come. Food's looking
Vanessa:

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:50.001
All right. Kung fu's looking good. Boxer's
looking good. What else punches? Gangsters

00:26:50.001 --> 00:27:00.139
may be punched. They got some fist fights
going on. Those are all looking like the best

00:27:00.139 --> 00:27:04.720
possible option. I'm going to start with boxer
because you said punch.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.860
Dan:
Ding, ding, ding.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.950
Vanessa:
I always feel so nervous whenever I touch

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.490
one. Maybe it's not right. You said punch.
Dan:

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.090
Maybe have another Lone Star State all over
again.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.090
Vanessa:
I know.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.200
Dan:
It's always a possibility.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.820
Vanessa:
I know that in kung fu they're not punching,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:26.200
but it's this kind of action, right? All I
know is Kung Fu Panda, so I don't know the

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.420
actual activity. What's-
Dan:

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.660
Just go with the stereotype.
Vanessa:

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.850
Let's go with kung fu.
Dan:

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.289
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa:

00:27:35.289 --> 00:27:38.990
Okay. You know what? I'm going to go for all
three.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.419
Dan:
Ooh, how exciting.

00:27:40.419 --> 00:27:43.070
Vanessa:
Yeah, because I feel pretty good about gangsters

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:49.400
punching. They get into brawls and you just
imagine that... Your face isn't looking so

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.799
positive here. Kind of just have a-
Dan:

00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:55.870
I'm trying to stay vague.
Vanessa:

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.830
Yeah. What's that movie with the gangsters?
Godfather. In The Godfather, I bet there was

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.200
lots of punches that were thrown. Actually
haven't seen The Godfather, but I imagine

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.799
there was lots of punching. That was your
word punch, right?

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:11.580
Dan:
Yes.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.260
Vanessa:
Okay. Gangster.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.929
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:18.720
Vanessa:
Yes.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.500
Dan:
(singing)

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.649
Vanessa:
Okay, so it's my turn to think of a hint.

00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:26.430
Are you ready for my next hint?
Dan:

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.680
Oh, I'm ready.
Vanessa:

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680
Okay.
Dan:

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.680
As ready as I'll ever be.
Vanessa:

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.120
I feel a little nervous.
Dan:

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120
Good.
Vanessa:

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.230
My hint is routine, two.
Dan:

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.549
Routine.
Vanessa:

00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:37.880
Routine.
Dan:

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.210
Routine.
Vanessa:

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.679
We'll see how Dan interprets this word.
Dan:

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.419
Routine. Routine.
Vanessa:

00:28:43.419 --> 00:28:44.590
Routine.
Dan:

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:48.480
Routine. Is this code? Routine rhymes with
poutine.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.200
Vanessa:
It is Codenames. It could be anything.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.360
Dan:
Poutine is in Canada. Canada is cold. Avalanches

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:11.830
are cold. I've got it. Routine. Okay. Let's
see. Oh. You shampoo your hair as part of

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.740
your shower routine.
Vanessa:

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.919
Don't look at my face. I can't give it away.
Dan:

00:29:18.919 --> 00:29:27.600
Bosses have routines. If you're the boss,
you know what's going on and you have a routine.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.570
Frogs, I'd say they just live by the seat
of their pants. They're not really making

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:40.470
routines. Mummies are wrapped up and dead.
No routines there. Let's see. Anything else

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:51.530
jumping out at me... Wedding. Wedding? Wedding.
No. Okay. I'm going to go with shampoo.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.700
Vanessa:
Ding, ding, ding.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.500
Dan:
Even though that's a little odd. I don't know.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.889
I just have this feeling that Vanessa is thinking
shower routine.

00:29:59.889 --> 00:30:01.659
Vanessa:
The thing is, you have to think about it from

00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:05.250
my perspective and what I think you would
guess, but also what I would think.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.350
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.450
Vanessa:
So it's this cycle.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.200
Dan:
Yes. How well do we know each other? Not that

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.340
well.
Vanessa:

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.210
Apparently... I don't know... That star in
Texas.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:18.080
Dan:
How well do we know each other's brain? It's

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:24.509
very hit or miss. Wait, there was another
one. I missed the first one. What was that?

00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:27.500
I already forget. Okay.
Vanessa:

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.799
Well, you have one more for routine.
Dan:

00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:30.799
Yeah, I know.
Vanessa:

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:31.899
You could skip it, but...
Dan:

00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:36.340
Sleep, sleep routine. Sleep. Sleep. It's probably
more than bus. Okay.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.220
Vanessa:
You got it.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.630
Dan:
She's like-

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:40.630
Vanessa:
Yep.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.639
Dan:
When I said boss, she was like, arrggg!

00:30:43.639 --> 00:30:45.149
Vanessa:
No. You do have one more.

00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:47.429
Dan:
Yeah. What was it again? You're probably not

00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:48.750
allowed to tell me, but tell me anyway.
Vanessa:

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.220
Yeah. I don't think I can tell you what the
hint is.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.809
Dan:
I already forget. What was it?

00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:53.960
Vanessa:
But it is legs.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.510
Dan:
Oh, leg. That's right.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.519
Vanessa:
Leg.

00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:58.539
Dan:
Leg.

00:30:58.539 --> 00:30:59.559
Vanessa:
Leg.

00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:02.630
Dan:
Leg. I mean I think we're, we're doing fine.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.150
I'm still going to pass for now.
Vanessa:

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.180
You're going to pass? Okay, so you still got
that sitting on the back burner.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.320
Dan:
Yeah, it's on the back burner.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.320
Vanessa:
All right.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.320
Dan:
If I can remember.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.460
Vanessa:
I'll take one of these. All right. Now it's

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.460
your turn to think of a hint.
Dan:

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:16.139
Yeah. You might think it was a short amount
of time before. It's been a long time.

00:31:16.139 --> 00:31:18.080
Vanessa:
We are cutting out the pauses where we think

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.309
of another hint. All right. It's your turn.
Dan:

00:31:21.309 --> 00:31:26.549
All right. I have my hint ready. It's a strange
word. Bullish.

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:27.880
Vanessa:
What?

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.210
Dan:
Bullish.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:34.600
Vanessa:
Like a bull but B-U-L-L-I-S-H?

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.440
Dan:
That was the best reaction ever. Bullish.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.779
"What?" You've never heard that word?
Vanessa:

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:41.759
Like he is bullish?
Dan:

00:31:41.759 --> 00:31:43.139
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:31:43.139 --> 00:31:44.350
He's like a bull?
Dan:

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.350
Bullish.
Vanessa:

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.160
Stubborn and pushes and like, "..." He's like
a bull.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.800
Dan:
Yeah, bullish.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.440
Vanessa:
All right.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.179
Dan:
Two, come on. Easy.

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:58.150
Vanessa:
Well, I feel like minotaur... A minotaur is

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:07.350
like a bull, so that's a pretty good one.
Gangster is already off the board, so that's

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:16.470
not obviously bullish. Boss. A bad boss could
be like that. I'm going to go first with minotaur.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.130
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.230
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.890
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:27.970
Vanessa:
And then, just to make sure... Bullish. Certainly

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:32.809
not a vocabulary word I would have said, but
it's okay. I get the point.

00:32:32.809 --> 00:32:35.399
Dan:
Now everybody will know the term bullish.

00:32:35.399 --> 00:32:38.559
Are you bullish? They also use this in the
stock market.

00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:39.559
Vanessa:
Mm.

00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:43.340
Dan:
Yeah, you're bullish about a stock or a commodity.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.379
Vanessa:
Is that the movie? Oh, that's The Wolf on

00:32:46.379 --> 00:32:47.860
Wall Street or something like that.
Dan:

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.860
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.870
But there's a bull if you go actually visit
the stock market.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:51.990
Dan:
Yeah, there's a bull there. Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:53.909
Vanessa:
There's a bull statue in New York.

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:55.750
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.350
Vanessa:
Okay. I'm going to go with bus.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.350
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.690
Vanessa:
Oh, wow. Was that it?

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.690
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:02.690
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:03.690
Dan:
Yeah.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:04.690
Vanessa:
All right. Well, good job.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.350
Dan:
This is running so much more smoothly than

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.389
the last game.
Vanessa:

00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:10.440
Okay. I'm going to think of a hint now. Are
you ready for my next hint?

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440
Dan:
I'm ready.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.321
Vanessa:
Okay. It's getting a little tougher now. My

00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:19.909
next hint took me a long time to think of
and it is Lancelot, two.

00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:22.049
Dan:
Lancelot.

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:26.659
Vanessa:
Thankfully, in this game you can use proper

00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:27.659
nouns.
Dan:

00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:29.950
Double the Lancelot. Lancelot.
Vanessa:

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.309
Did you says Lancelot?
Dan:

00:33:32.309 --> 00:33:34.659
Lancelot. No. Two hints.
Vanessa:

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:36.080
Oh, two.
Dan:

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080
Two words.
Vanessa:

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080
Yes. There are two words related to Lancelot.
Dan:

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.080
Lancelot.
Vanessa:

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080
Hopefully not more.
Dan:

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.559
I don't know a lot about Lancelot. I mean,
he's a Knight of the Round Table. I know that's

00:33:45.559 --> 00:33:52.269
true. Probably wore armor, guarantee that.
Probably didn't wear a bikini, just saying.

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:53.879
I don't think so.
Vanessa:

00:33:53.879 --> 00:33:58.380
I think you know enough about him to say that's
a pretty clear cut no.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:04.639
Dan:
But if I recall, he might ride a reindeer.

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:06.293
Lancelot comes in on his noble steed, the
reindeer.

00:34:06.293 --> 00:34:07.293
Vanessa:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:34:07.293 --> 00:34:08.293
Dan:
Is that right?

00:34:08.293 --> 00:34:11.770
Vanessa:
I'm certain they had reindeer in England at

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:12.770
that time.
Dan:

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.110
So I'm definitely going to tap armor.
Vanessa:

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.210
Yes, you are correct. Lancelot wore armor
as far as we know.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.210
Dan:
(singing)

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.450
Vanessa:
I mean he's a fictional character, right?

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:30.120
Dan:
Did he have spurs? I always associates spurs

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:42.090
with cowboys, more modern. Is Lancelot known
for getting married or something? I don't

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:48.240
know enough about the story. Who is Lancelot?
What's his story? What's his deal?

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.310
Vanessa:
Well, you have one more-

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.290
Dan:
Tell me more about Lancelot.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:56.040
Vanessa:
I cannot tell you, but you have one more word.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:03.880
If you get it, you can also guess another
word which you have missed along the way.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.040
Dan:
Lancelot.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.490
Vanessa:
Or you can pass. We've got four tokens left,

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:14.600
so we're doing pretty well. Doing much better
than the last round.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.290
Dan:
I don't know. It's between wedding and spurs.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:24.401
I don't know why wedding. I just feel maybe
with the story, maybe he gets married to what's

00:35:24.401 --> 00:35:31.050
her name? Guinevere? Or is that somebody else?
Obviously I don't know enough about Lancelet

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:39.570
and I'm afraid I'm going to get the assassin
so I I don't want to be a wuss and pass twice.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.470
Can't do that.
Vanessa:

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:45.270
What are you going to touch them?
Dan:

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.270
Spurs.
Vanessa:

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.840
Wop wop. It's neutral so it's not correct.
Dan:

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840
At least it's neutral.
Vanessa:

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.090
But it's not a bomb word so we don't lose-
Dan:

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.700
Spurs, you use to get your horse to go.
Vanessa:

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.700
Yeah. I didn't-
Dan:

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.700
Lancelet rode a horse, guaranteed.
Vanessa:

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.320
I'm sure that, yeah, knights did have spurs.
Dan:

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.320
Did they?
Vanessa:

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.830
Yeah, I totally didn't even think about that.
Dan:

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:03.830
Oh, okay.
Vanessa:

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:04.830
Well, they weren't spurs.
Dan:

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:05.830
I'm not crazy.
Vanessa:

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.200
They weren't spurs in the sense that we think
of them with the little wheel. I think they

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.820
were just spikes.
Dan:

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.020
Oh, just spikes. That doesn't sound nice-.
Vanessa:

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.090
At least what I know.
Dan:

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:14.410
To a horse.
Vanessa:

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:20.270
But now I know you don't know much about Lancelot.
Don't worry. The second one was not so obvious.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.060
The first one, armor was much more obvious.
Dan:

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.060
Okay. Okay.
Vanessa:

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.190
All right. It's your turn to think of a hint.
Dan:

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:32.060
I have one more, so I'm just going to give
one hint, obviously. The hint is snow, one.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:39.890
Vanessa:
Snow. Oh, we've got reindeer and avalanche,

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:44.510
but you probably would have said a different
word if it were reindeer. I know it's only

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:54.240
one, but I feel a little bit of pressure because
that's the last one. Snow. Let's go with avalanche.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.240
Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240
Vanessa:
Whew.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240
Dan:
That's right.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.240
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.130
Dan:
I mean, I figured with reindeer...

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.180
Vanessa:
You would have said something else.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.630
Dan:
You would say avalanche before reindeer, right?

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.390
Vanessa:
Yeah. You would have said something to do

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.290
with Santa or something like that.
Dan:

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.600
Yeah. I just felt like it's probably a safe
enough bet.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600
Vanessa:
Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.220
Dan:
Even though it might confuse you a little

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.220
bit. Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.640
It did for a moment just because I wanted
to make sure it was right. All right, so you

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.680
get one more token and-
Dan:

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.680
I'm done.
Vanessa:

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.240
Wow. You're done with all your words? Well,
I have two more.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.510
Dan:
All my words are done.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.030
Vanessa:
Two more that you have passed on, but I'm

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.020
going to give you a hint anyway.
Dan:

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.600
Passed on both of these.
Vanessa:

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.830
I'm going to give you a hint. I'm going to
see if I can try to combine them.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.110
Dan:
Yeah. That way, you got two chances so let's

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.310
see how it goes.
Vanessa:

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:40.020
Yeah. All right. Give me a second. It is time
for my final hint.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.430
Dan:
The final hint.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:43.730
Vanessa:
Yes. We have two tokens left so there's not

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.400
much pressure on the board as far losing the
game-

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400
Dan:
But not really.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.380
Vanessa:
But I still want to give a good hint.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.380
Dan:
Okay.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.570
Vanessa:
My hint is bases.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.570
Dan:
Bases.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.560
Vanessa:
Two.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.550
Dan:
Bases. Bases. Bases.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.550
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:06.520
Dan:
First base, second base. We made it to first

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:18.360
base, third base... Yeah, bases. Bases. Something
about that word is throwing me off. Well,

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.880
okay, so for some reason, the first thing
that comes to my mind is baseball.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.300
Vanessa:
Well, that makes sense. Bases, baseball.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.830
Dan:
I'm guessing she's talking about stepping

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:34.880
on the base because that also coincides with
the leg. So I'm going to go ahead and touch

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880
that.
Vanessa:

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.390
Good work.
Dan:

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:45.920
All right. And bases... So wait, it's leg.
What was the other word? Lancelot. Lancelot.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.890
Lancelot.
Vanessa:

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.300
Don't be thrown off too much by Lancelot because-
Dan:

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:57.040
Bases. He made it to first base, which is
kissing. Does Lancelot kiss?

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.591
Vanessa:
I can't tell you.

00:38:58.591 --> 00:39:03.040
Dan:
I wish I knew anything about Lancelot other

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.580
than he's a Knight of the Round Table.
Vanessa:

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.450
You already said some other important facts
about him though.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.560
Dan:
Did I?

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.560
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.620
Dan:
What did I say? What did I say? He's a Knight

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.050
of the Round Table.
Vanessa:

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.050
And?
Dan:

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.570
He rides a steed.
Vanessa:

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.870
And we know it's not a reindeer.
Dan:

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.170
Married somebody? Now she's giving me hints.
Vanessa:

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.080
Okay. I can't give any facial expressions.
Dan:

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:41.820
So wait, do you consider wedding a base? All
right. Well, I'm pretty sure Lancelot didn't

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.050
wear a tuxedo to his wedding, so I'm going
to touch wedding.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.050
Vanessa:
No.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.190
Dan:
It's not wedding? You looked at me like it's

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:51.190
a wedding.
Vanessa:

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.190
No. Okay.
Dan:

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.190
What?
Vanessa:

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.680
So that's a neutral one, but because you don't
have any...

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.820
Dan:
No.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.120
Vanessa:
Because you don't have any-

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.120
Dan:
At least it's neutral.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.600
Vanessa:
Other words, then you get another guess. I

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.410
can say the same hint again because we still
have one more token left.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:11.380
Dan:
Okay. Yeah, but the hint is bases. You can't

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.380
say a new one.
Vanessa:

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.380
Right.
Dan:

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.540
Unless you use that. Are you using it?
Vanessa:

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.420
Well, we have to use that new token because
you've already missed it so you don't get

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.430
an extra guess, so we have to go back.
Dan:

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:24.470
Oh, I see what you're saying.
Vanessa:

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:26.330
As if it skips your turn and goes back to
me.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.330
Dan:
Right, right, right.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.330
Vanessa:
But I could say the same hint again, but I'm

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.370
going to say something else.
Dan:

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.360
Okay. You should say a new hint.
Vanessa:

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:42.530
Yeah. Okay. Let me think about it for a second.
This is the third time I'm trying to connect

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.930
this word.
Dan:

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:51.400
All the hints are going right over my head.
Lancelot. Who's that? Legs. Where? What was

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.270
the other one?
Vanessa:

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.270
Bases.
Dan:

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.270
Bases.
Vanessa:

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.950
That did not go over your head.
Dan:

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:05.290
So it must be kissing... Maybe. I don't know.
I don't know enough. Lancelot is throwing

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.010
me off because I don't know anything about
him.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.481
Vanessa:
Yeah, I'll tell you why I said Lancelot later.

00:41:10.481 --> 00:41:11.640
Dan:
I'm sure I'll find out why.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.700
Vanessa:
Okay.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.000
Dan:
Was he even a real guy? I don't know.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.690
Vanessa:
I'm going to go with...

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.870
Dan:
Well, just give me a simple hint. How hard

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:28.950
could it be to get into this brain?
Vanessa:

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.510
Ready?
Dan:

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.070
Yes.
Vanessa:

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.410
Love, one.
Dan:

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:38.611
Love, one. Love. You only wear tuxedos when
you're in love.

00:41:38.611 --> 00:41:40.090
Vanessa:
Please guess the right word. We only have

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.090
one left.
Dan:

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:42.090
Kiss.
Vanessa:

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.500
Yes. Thank you. So you said-
Dan:

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.770
It is first base.
Vanessa:

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.390
It is first base. You said, "We made it to
first base."

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:51.050
Dan:
But when I said he got married, you winked

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.870
at me. I was going to say kiss.
Vanessa:

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:53.870
No.
Dan:

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.710
But then you were... I was like, "Lancelet
gets married," right? And you're like, uh

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.710
huh!
Vanessa:

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.710
I was trying to have just a goofy face.
Dan:

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:01.710
Oh.
Vanessa:

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:04.340
No, Lancelot and Guinevere, I imagine that
they kissed.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.780
Dan:
Oh, I was right about Guinevere?

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.780
Vanessa:
Yes.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.711
Dan:
I knew details I thought I didn't know.

00:42:08.711 --> 00:42:12.190
Vanessa:
The problem was the was the word frog on the

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:18.950
board. I had sleep, kiss and armor and I thought
I could say prince, like in a fairy tale.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:28.870
A prince wears armor and he kisses the princess
who's sleeping. But also, if you kiss a frog,

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:29.870
he could become a prince.
Dan:

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.740
A frog prince. Was that your assassin word?
Vanessa:

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.870
No, but I just didn't want you to guess it.
Dan:

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:34.870
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:39.900
Or if I said princess, a princess and the
frog. This word frog killed so many.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.000
Dan:
And frog legs.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.920
Vanessa:
Yeah, I didn't think about that.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.990
Dan:
I thought of that.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.140
Vanessa:
I should've thought of that, but I was going

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:53.540
to say a specific knight who wears armor.
None of the Disney princesses have names though.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.040
Or they're not like common names. If I said-
Dan:

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040
Princesses?
Vanessa:

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.040
Oh, the princes.
Dan:

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.040
Oh, the prince.
Vanessa:

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.790
None of the princes because Sleeping Beauty,
that's who I wanted to say. Her name is Aurora.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.960
Dan:
Doesn't the Cinderella guy have a name?

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.340
Vanessa:
Prince Charming? Yeah.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.090
Dan:
No, it was something else. I don't remember

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.340
what it is though.
Vanessa:

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.630
Well, there was nothing that was super obvious.
Anyway, the word frog was really throwing

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:19.880
me off, so in the end I said Lancelot because
he kisses Guinevere, I guess. I imagine.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.350
Dan:
Oh, okay. See, when you said Lancelot, I thought

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:30.760
it had to be... So I wasn't thinking you were
thinking, "Oh, he probably kissed Guinevere."

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.760
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.760
Dan:
I thought it was more like there's a pivotal

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:40.950
scene where Lancelot swoops up Guinevere and
kisses her and she turns into an eagle...

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:41.950
Something like that.
Vanessa:

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.510
Oh, wow. That would be much more epic than
the real story. That was a little bit of a

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:51.940
stretch, but I figured you might connect Guinevere.
I almost said Guinevere instead, but you wouldn't

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:52.962
say armor for Guinevere.
Dan:

00:43:52.962 --> 00:43:54.890
Yeah. Lancelet was better. Well, I mean...
Vanessa:

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.984
But you did say Guinevere. Anyway, there was
a connection between all of these.

00:43:57.984 --> 00:43:58.984
Dan:
We had enough turns.

00:43:58.984 --> 00:44:02.790
Vanessa:
I would say that this round was a lot smoother

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:04.010
than the last round.
Dan:

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.010
Yes.
Vanessa:

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:10.400
We cut out a lot of time. This round took
us about half the amount of time that the

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400
other one did-
Dan:

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400
Yeah, half the time.
Vanessa:

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400
But it was still enjoyable.
Dan:

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.400
Yeah. It was a good time.
Vanessa:

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.400
We beat the game.
Dan:

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.400
We did it.
Vanessa:

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.400
Good work.
Dan:

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.400
We did it again.
Vanessa:

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400
Good work.
Dan:

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400
We killed the assassin. Is that the point
of the game?

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400
Vanessa:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400
Dan:
There's actually some kind of story. Yeah.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400
Vanessa:
Well.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400
Dan:
we're secret agents apparently.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400
Vanessa:
Of course.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400
Dan:
Can't you tell?

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400
Dan:
Well, we solved the mystery.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.400
Vanessa:
Yeah. Secret agents play board games late

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.400
at night.
Dan:

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.400
Case closed.
Vanessa:

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:36.210
Yes. Good work. Well, thank you so much for
joining us for this unique English lesson

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:42.890
where we talk about words and this board game.
What I would like you to do is I want you

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:47.470
to decide if any of these words that we talked
about, that showed up here on the screen,

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:52.581
that we mentioned, were new for you. Learn
something more about them. Look them up. Try

00:44:52.581 --> 00:44:54.310
to use them in the comments.
Dan:

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:55.470
Buy the game. Try it.
Vanessa:

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.470
Yeah. Try Codenames.
Dan:

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.470
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa:

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.950
It's really cool. I'll try to find a link
and just put it in the description because

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:04.150
it's pretty fun. You can play with two people.
You can get the regular one and play it with

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:09.010
more people if you know more people who want
to do it in English, but I think this was

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:13.310
voted top game of 2018 maybe a couple of years
ago.

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.310
Dan:
It's just a good game.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.020
Vanessa:
Yeah, it's a great game. We play it at a lot

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:21.230
of parties. But next week I'm going to be
making a video where I break down some of

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:27.160
the specific words that we used in this lesson,
so you'll be able to see them in more detail.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.100
We'll take a look at some clips from this
game that we played so that you can just get

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.440
a better feeling for how you could use these
words as well. Maybe you understood the general

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.190
concept, but not in detail, every single thing.
Well, thanks for joining me, Dan.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.190
Dan:
You're welcome.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.440
Vanessa:
I appreciate you spending your evening playing

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440
this game.
Dan:

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.470
Playing games.
Vanessa:

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.850
Yeah, we got to drink tea.
Dan:

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:50.550
Nothing wrong with that.
Vanessa:

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.490
You got some beer. We, yeah, had a good time.
Cheers.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.490
Dan:
Cheers.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:55.490
Vanessa:
Well, thanks so much for joining us and I'll

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:59.580

here on my YouTube channel. Bye.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.580
Dan:

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.160
