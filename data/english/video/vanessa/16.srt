Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.950
Are you experiencing a lockdown or quarantine
in your country? Let's talk about it.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.280
Vanessa:
It's true that we are living in very unusual

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.950
times right now. It doesn't matter where you're
from, what your native language is, what your

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.389
background is, you are most likely experiencing
the same lockdown and quarantine type situation

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:37.550
that everyone else in the world is experiencing
right now. For me, I live in the US in the

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.100
state of North Carolina, and we're experiencing
this in some ways, but also in a different

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.420
way than people from other areas in the US
and other areas of the world. So today I want

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.729
to bring you a special present. This is a
long video, but I hope you will enjoy it because

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.519
I have some special guests for you today.
It was my pleasure to be able to interview

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.799
four online YouTube English teachers who you
probably know and ask them about what the

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.520
lockdown has been like in their country and
just in their daily lives.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.840
Vanessa:
So our first guest today is Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.240
The second guest is Gabby from Go Natural
English. My third guest is Jack from To Fluency,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.950
and my fourth guest is Lucy from the channel
English with Lucy. At the end of this video,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.899
my husband, Dan, and I will talk a little
bit about our personal experience with the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.980
lockdown and quarantine here in the US at
least in our state of North Carolina. So I

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.649
hope that you'll be able to enjoy this video.

It's great to improve your listening skills,
vocabulary, grammar, everything, and just

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.000
spend a little bit of time feeling like we
are in this together. We can do it. All right,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.250
let's go on and meet our first guest who is
Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.170
Vanessa:
All right, today I am lucky to have the wonderful

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.209
guest, Emma from mmmEnglish. Thank you so
much for joining me Emma.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.440
Emma:
No worries. I'm excited to have a chat on

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.720
the other side of the world. We're doing a
lot of these lightly.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.720
Vanessa:
Yeah, so right now it's 10:00 AM for you and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.290
10:00 PM for me. So we are literally on opposite
sides of the earth, but experiencing some

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.319
similar things. I thought that we could have
a chat about the world circumstances right

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.000
now with Coronavirus and how that's affecting
all of us. Doesn't matter what country we're

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.489
in. So my first question for you is, I'm curious
what kind of regulations or changes have happened

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.409
where you live? First of all, where do you
live, but also what kind of changes have happened

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.470
for you?
Emma:

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.599
First things first. Well, I'm in Australia.
I live in Perth, which is on the west coast

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.500
of Australia, similar time zone to Singapore,
and we have been really, really fortunate

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.569
in Australia for a couple of reasons. The
first reason is we're really isolated. We

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.930
are that far down the bottom end of the earth.
No one comes through here on the way to somewhere

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.200
else. It's just Australia is the final destination.
And I think that for us in a situation like

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.310
we're in now, that is a huge advantage because
we just don't have as many people coming through.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.400
And I feel like we were so lucky about that.
Vanessa:

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.920
Especially I Perth.
Emma:

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.409
Yeah, sometimes that's really frustrating.
It's like, "Oh God, we're so far away from

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:16.230
everything," but right now it's quite handy.
But we also had the huge advantage to be able

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:27.530
to see what was happening before it got to
us. So before it got really serious. I think

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.640
that Australians generally, we're pretty easy
going people. We don't take each other or

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:41.010
a government or anything too seriously, which
is a good thing and can be a bad thing. But

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.430
I really think that Australians wouldn't have
responded so well and so quickly to this problem

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:56.240
if we couldn't see what was happening in Italy,
in China, in South Korea, in Spain beforehand,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.320
and I think that was a huge plus for us as
well.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.670
Emma:
So at the moment anyway, to answer your question,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:14.080
we are allowed to go out in groups of twos
or if you all live in the same house, a family,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.570
you can all go out together, and a lot of
the restaurants or all of the restaurants,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.090
gyms, cinemas and things are closed.
Vanessa:

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.480
Can you order a takeout from restaurants?
Emma:

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:37.160
You can. You can do that. So it's interesting
to think how some businesses or some industries

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.990
are able to really quickly adapt to a situation
like this. So, yeah, we can order takeouts.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.420
I've been spending a lot of time cooking or
doing things at home, which I normally don't

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.680
do that much. So I've been taking advantage
of cooking in the kitchen and home meals and

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680
that kind of thing.
Vanessa:

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.880
Yeah, I guess that leads into my second question
of has your daily life changed much since

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.070
all of these regulations and changes have
happened in the government level?

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.340
Emma:
Yeah, it's interesting because I work at home

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:24.680
in my home office. I film in my house. I film
all of my YouTube videos and things in my

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.510
house. So really not a lot has changed with
me in terms of work, but my social life has

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.640
been affected obviously. All of our social
lives have been affected. So for me, that's

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.850
been the biggest change is not being able
to go out and see friends and do the things

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:52.150
that I would normally do, but yeah, not a
huge amount of change for me as of yet.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.290
Vanessa:
Yeah, I guess especially because you already

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:02.510
are used to working from home and the people
you work with, you work with remotely I imagine.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.110
So that's convenient.
Emma:

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:11.310
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. My whole team, actually,
no one who I work with is based here in Perth

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:19.940
where I am. We're across time zones, across
countries and are already quite familiar with

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:28.490
working this way. So it hasn't changed how
we do things really, but it has changed the

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:38.330
way that we support our communities I guess.
In particular, language communities that I've

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.980
run or that I'm a part of, we've done a lot
to change the way that we deliver things,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:52.910
deliver lessons, deliver content to support
all of our students who are now at home with

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:58.140
lots more time, but able to connect more than
previously, and I think that's a really exciting

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.830
opportunity for language learners.
Vanessa:

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:06.830
Yeah, all of a sudden, there's more free time
and the internet is really a great way to

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.800
be able to fill that and you can fill it positively
with education.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.960
Emma:
Yeah.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.300
Vanessa:
I'm curious where you live, do you have any

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.230
outdoor space where you can go like a yard
or any kind of private areas like that?

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.500
Emma:
So I live in an apartment and I've got a couple

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:38.930
of big balconies which I can be outside on,
which is nice. I also live right near the

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:48.029
beach. Just over the way. And for us we're
quite lucky in that it's... We're coming out

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:54.470
of summer and so it's still quite long and
the sun is shining, the weather is still really

00:08:54.470 --> 00:09:03.660
good, so there's a lot of outdoor activities
that we can still do, obviously within just

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.810
in groups of two or not gathering in large
places and things like that, but we're still

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.510
able to make the most of the parks and things
like that.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.680
Vanessa:
It's interesting that those types of places

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.269
are still open where you are because I live
in the mountains where there's a lot of nature

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:27.050
trails and it seems like the perfect place
to go during a time like this, but it seems

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:32.830
like at the same time, that's all that anyone
can do right now. So there were so many people

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:39.220
doing that, but they closed like national
parks and a lot of the hiking areas are closed

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:45.120
off because people didn't really treat it
respectfully I imagine. But if the beach or

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.639
places where you're at, people are still trying
to maintain some distance, then it can still

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.089
be used.
Emma:

00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:59.230
Yeah. Well, that's the thing. There was a
news story a couple of weeks ago about Bondi

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.879
Beach in Sydney, which is a really famous
beach, being absolutely covered in people.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:09.129
And so the government came out and had to
say, "Come on guys, we've told you that you're

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:15.399
not going to do this. We're going to have
to close the beach." And so over here, there's

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:20.300
fewer people in the city where I live, but
the government has also been saying, "You

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:26.230
really have to follow the rules. Otherwise,
we are going to have to close down the beaches."

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.480
Vanessa:
Yeah, as long as people are doing that, then

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.510
it's usable. And at the end of summer, the
perfect thing to do to refresh your mind a

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.839
little bit.
Emma:

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:45.689
Yeah, I feel like if I didn't have that space,
I would be feeling a lot more frustrated right

00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:49.199
now. So fortunately and fingers crossed, it
stays that way.

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:51.529
Vanessa:
Yeah, especially living in an apartment, it's

00:10:51.529 --> 00:10:55.829
essential to be able to get outside and have
some open space.

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:58.029
Emma:
Yeah, sure it is.

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:01.200
Vanessa:
So I'm curious, looking to the future, what

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.430
do you think life is going to be like after
the pandemic has passed? Assuming that it

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:13.060
will pass in some way, hopefully at some point.
What do you think life's going to be like

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.959
in your hypothetical opinion?
Emma:

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:20.970
Oh, I didn't know. I've been thinking about
this quite a lot lately. I think that one

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:27.569
of the most exciting changes is what's happening
in our workforce and the way that people are

00:11:27.569 --> 00:11:37.149
having to very quickly learn how to work from
home, work remotely when their team is not

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:43.720
around them. And for lots of businesses, that's
really, really challenging. Lots of industries,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:52.820
that's quite hard to do. But for many, I think
it was almost like a stubbornness by lots

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:59.709
of very traditional companies too who didn't
believe that they could trust their staff

00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:06.089
or that it was possible for everyone to be
as productive and as effective at home. So

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:10.800
I think it's really exciting that we've been
forced into this situation where everyone's

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.399
been put to the test a little to see is this
possible? Can it work? What are all of the

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:21.430
tools that we need to make it work?
Emma:

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:27.269
And the reason why I think that's really exciting
is because it creates a much more level playing

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:36.150
field for a whole bunch of people in our society.
Women, people who are raising families, for

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.480
people with disabilities or other challenges
that they have in their labs that mean they

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:47.670
need a little bit more flexibility in the
way that they do things. And so I feel like

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:54.259
this has been a really interesting opportunity
for them to experience that and to prove to

00:12:54.259 --> 00:13:00.449
their managers, bosses, companies, that it
might be a possible way forward for them.

00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.449
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:04.170
Emma:
Yeah, I don't know what you think about that,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.660
but I definitely feel like that's one of the
biggest positives that is coming out of this

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.660
situation.
Vanessa:

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.749
Yeah, I hadn't really thought about people
who might be at some kind of disadvantage

00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:21.550
how this could help them in their career,
but even thinking about people who live in

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:31.069
some far away remote area, if a company is
more used to hiring online and allowing people

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:36.829
to work remotely, why not hire someone who
lives far away as well who maybe doesn't have

00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:43.449
access to a really great company, but if they're
allowed to work remotely, maybe all of a sudden

00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:48.570
people in other areas have access to a great
job or all of those types of things. That

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.529
would be really good thing to see.
Emma:

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:57.790
Yeah, we can see this whole boom in the technology
and the tools that we need to support us through

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:03.950
this as well and I think, yeah, exactly. Like
you said, people in regional areas or rural

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:10.579
areas who previously had to move to big cities
to these big job opportunities, maybe that

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:13.059
will change. I think that's really exciting.
Vanessa:

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:14.059
Yeah.
Emma:

00:14:14.059 --> 00:14:21.629
A lot of things have been shaken up by this.
I don't think we have had the chance to really

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:29.670
anticipate it. So we've had to respond really
quickly. Socially, things have changed a lot,

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:35.499
environmentally, things are changing a lot,
politically, all of these things, economically

00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:43.290
obviously, and I think really it's a once
in a lifetime opportunity for us to try something

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.949
different. You're forced into something different.
Vanessa:

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:48.829
Everyone around the world is doing it.
Emma:

00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:58.319
Everyone's doing it. But the really most interesting
part I think is being able to think about

00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:05.439
what we take back to normal after this is
finished, after the pandemic's over, after

00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:15.110
they find a vaccine and the fear and the stress
and the worry reduces a little. But there's

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:22.749
so many different things that I'm constantly
thinking I caught like this aspect of this

00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:32.870
new life that we have. So how can I take that
back into what I was doing, what is normal?

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:41.540
So a lot of that is to do with like the social
side of things and I guess just slowing things

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.600
down a little.
Emma:

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.679
Before all of this happened, I was working
hours and hours and hours and hours a day,

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:53.079
rushing round, then trying to go out and meet
friends and do this and go there and buy this

00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:57.910
and all of these things, and I was constantly
running around and rushing and trying to make

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:04.579
all of these things fit into the limited number
of hours I had in my day. And what I've really,

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:13.040
really appreciated is just the opportunity
to slow that down and to do some more things

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:19.619
that are just for me or just focusing on me
a little bit. More sleep or a little bit more

00:16:19.619 --> 00:16:26.440
exercise. Like I said, I'm doing a bit more
cooking, which before I was like, "I'm too

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.439
busy for that." I'm enjoying that as well.
So I'm thinking carefully about what parts

00:16:31.439 --> 00:16:38.369
of this experience now I have wanted to try
and take back into new normal once all of

00:16:38.369 --> 00:16:39.369
this is over.
Vanessa:

00:16:39.369 --> 00:16:44.811
Yeah, I think it will seem, like you mentioned,
if you're a go, go, go kind of person, to

00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:52.019
just jump back into that might seem hectic.
It was hectic before but you see it as hectic

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:58.959
now, which will be an interesting shift. We'll
see exactly what happens, but it's very interesting.

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:03.459
Emma:
Perfect. It's very nice. But it's a very idealistic

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:04.730
way of looking at our current situation.
Vanessa:

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:09.390
Yeah, I like that positive attitude though
because there's so many negative things or

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:14.531
all of the fear and stress, so just thinking
about the positives we can take away, it's

00:17:14.531 --> 00:17:17.330
really... Yeah, it's good for the morale.
Emma:

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:23.360
I'm always trying to think more positively
of that. In this situation it’s all you

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.220
can do.
Vanessa:

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:32.410
Yes. Well, thank you so much Emma for this
chat and thank you for sharing it with all

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:37.240
of my students as well. I hope they get a
chance to, I'm sure all of them have already

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.520
seen mmmEnglish, but if you haven't, make
sure you check it out. I'll post links and

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.440
all of that as well.
Well, thank you so much. I hope we get to

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.060
chat again sometime in the future.
Emma:

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.440
Wow, absolutely. Have a really good sleep.
Vanessa:

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.750
Have a good day.
Emma:

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.750
You too.
Vanessa:

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:03.290
Bye. Well, today I am lucky to be here with
Gabby from Go Natural English, another amazing

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.770
English teaching channel. You've been around
YouTube for quite awhile.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.660
Gabby:
It's almost 10 years. Hi everyone.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.230
Vanessa:
Amazing. Well, I'm so glad that you're here.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.010
Thank you so much for taking your valuable
time today.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.480
Gabby:
Thank you. I'm really excited to be here with

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.970
you, Vanessa. Thank you.
Vanessa:

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:26.270
Yes, so even though we're living far apart,
we are experiencing similar life circumstances

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:32.940
right now. So I'm curious for you, what kind
of regulations or changes have happened in

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:38.100
the last month where you live? First of all,
what area or what country are you living in

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.090
so people can get an idea and what kind of
changes have happened over the last month

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.640
for you?
Gabby:

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:51.620
It's been very interesting because last month,
I was in Kansas City for a few weeks and then

00:18:51.620 --> 00:19:01.390
went back to Los Angeles right as the virus
was unfolding and new regulations and orders

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:10.960
were coming into play. And so we decided,
my boyfriend and I, we decided to come back

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:23.010
to the Kansas City area from LA. So when LA
had this roll outs of new orders, we thought,

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:29.970
"Okay, maybe we should go back to Missouri
where things are a little bit more calm and

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:37.270
peaceful and less people." And so we're actually
in the Kansas City area right now, and it's

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:44.430
interesting because across the United States,
we've had these say at home orders, right?

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:50.080
And it happened first in Los Angeles and then
here in Kansas City. It was about a week behind

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.910
here. So we had a little more time to prepare,
but we have been staying at home just like

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.650
most people in the US.
Vanessa:

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.651
Yeah, and probably you have a little more
space there too.

00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:01.651
Gabby:
Yes.

00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:02.651
Vanessa:
Maybe you feel a little more comfortable.

00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:03.651
Gabby:
A bit.

00:20:03.651 --> 00:20:04.651
Vanessa:
Or space there to maybe feel...

00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:05.651
Gabby:
Yes!

00:20:05.651 --> 00:20:06.651
Vanessa:
... a little more comfortable.

00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:07.651
Gabby:
A bigger yard to play in, yes.

00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:09.230
Vanessa:
That is essential. So you have some private

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.350
or personal outdoor space that you can go
to like a yard?

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:19.080
Gabby:
Exactly. Yeah. So personal stories, I have

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.151
a house in the Kansas City area and I have
some family in the Kansas City area, so I

00:20:23.151 --> 00:20:29.920
go back and forth a lot. So it just seems
like an easy place to kind of hunker down

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:38.660
during stay at home and just have more space
to walk around in the yard or be outside,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.660
so
Vanessa:

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:48.670
I'm curious because you teach online, I imagine
most of your work related things are at home

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:54.730
or at least not out and in an office. So how
has your daily life changed since all of this?

00:20:54.730 --> 00:21:00.420
I know you've moved back and forth a little
bit, but as far as just your daily habits,

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.470
has an awful lot changed for you?
Gabby:

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:09.340
Honestly, because for so many years I've been
working from home. I mean I know it's a big

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.670
change for many people to be working from
home, working remotely. But I've been doing

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:21.610
this for so long, I just kind of feel like
it's another day at my home office. You know,

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:29.360
speaking of work, not like, you know, free
time or social life, but work life is pretty

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.320
much the same. It's, I feel very lucky in
that regard.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.500
Vanessa:
Yeah, I do too. Just to be already comfortable

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.320
with working from home and that you can continue
doing that.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.320
Gabby:
Yeah.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.860
Vanessa:
It's really a good position to be in and hopefully

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.670
helpful for English learners. We can keep
giving them English lessons.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.040
Gabby:
Absolutely. Yeah, and I think more and more

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:57.480
people are looking to the internet and YouTube
and online courses to learn from nowadays

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.760
and it's becoming more and more normal and
I love that because that's what we do.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.210
Vanessa:
Yeah. Yeah. It seems like this is the perfect

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:11.230
time to spend more time enriching yourself
if you have a little bit extra time.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.710
Gabby:
Definitely, now is the time. If you have to

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:19.040
stay at home and have a little extra free
time because you're not going out, then learn

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.310
something new.
Vanessa:

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:26.970
Yeah. Have you found yourself at all picking
up other activities or, I know a lot of people,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:32.440
at least around here have gotten pets or they
like started a garden cause you're at home

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.590
a lot.
Gabby:

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:39.890
It's really funny because my dad gave me a
stack of books and magazines about country

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:47.000
living, which is, it's very Missouri this
is kind of a rural area, if people don't know,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.950
Kansas city is a big city, but anyway, some
people like my dad are into raising chickens

00:22:54.950 --> 00:23:00.200
and having a garden and so I've become a little
obsessed with the idea having a garden and

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.600
chickens. I don't have any yet, but hopefully
soon.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.060
Vanessa:
Yeah, I think at least around here the stores

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.270
have, I don't know if there's specific, there's
not really specific chicken stores, but places

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:16.790
where you get chickens have just sold out
because so many people are wanting to kind

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.770
of spend more quiet time, go back to the traditional
ideas.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.450
Gabby:
It's very interesting.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.020
Vanessa:
Yeah. I guess people like your dad are ahead

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.020
of the curve.
Gabby:

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.230
Well, he was ahead of the curve before even
it started. Yeah.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.890
Vanessa:
Yeah, I'm curious, what do you think is going

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:41.151
to happen in the future after, at least the
major part of their pandemic has passed? What

00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:44.070
do you think life's going to be like? Similar
difference.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.440
Gabby:
I think it will be a little different than

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:54.960
before. I think that we may not go out as
much as before. Maybe it will take a while

00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:02.250
to get back to where we were or maybe people
will be a little bit more hesitant to go out

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:10.170
or do things in large groups or too close
together to other people. You know? I think

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:15.150
long answers short, just people will be a
little bit more cautious because I don't think

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:22.420
the virus will go away completely, we'll have
to just be aware of washing our hands more

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:28.240
often and you know, just taking care of ourselves
if we do get sick, not pushing ourselves too

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:34.370
hard, I hope that it will become more normal
to maybe work from home if you're not feeling

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:39.080
well or take time off if you're not feeling
well and you know for people to really be

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080
healthy.
Vanessa:

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:46.020
Yeah, yeah, the idea of continue. It's hard
to just shake the idea that, "Oh, I shouldn't

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.750
stand too close to my neighbor". All those
things that, it feels weird now, but it also

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:58.470
feels weird to hug a neighbor because we've
got so used to that distancing so people were

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.810
not jumped back in.
Gabby:

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.290
Yeah. People are not really hugging or shaking
hands these days, and I think you're right.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:09.590
It will be. It will be a little strange to
start doing that again. I think there's going

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:14.790
to be some very awkward monks months ahead
where we're like, do we shake hands? Or? Cause

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.790
"hi".
Vanessa:

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:21.690
Yeah. Yeah. It even feels weird like that
now because at least where I live, there's

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:29.000
not an awful lot of cases, or at least it's
not people I'm personally know, so when you

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.640
see your neighbors, it just feels weird like,
Oh, I want to help you in your garden or give

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.840
you some food, or all those types of things,
but kind of keep our distance.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.870
Gabby:
Yeah, right. It's really interesting, I think

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.990
we're all just kind of figuring it out together
at the same time and it's good to talk about

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:54.770
it, I'm really glad that you know we're having
this talk and that you'll talk with other

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.600
English teachers and many other people in
the comments too. I'm sure will have this

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.640
discussion continuing, but it's interesting
to figure out what is life going to be like

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.892
in the following months and years.
Vanessa:

00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:12.920
Yeah. I'm curious especially too for children,
how they're going to be in the future, will

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:20.330
this be a traumatic event where they'll be
afraid to touch other people or get close.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.260
Gabby:
Or children who we're in school and they're

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.900
learning from home and they, I mean there's
so many children who are not going back to

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.750
school until maybe next year, it's crazy.
Vanessa:

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:39.040
Yeah. Yeah. Even for my two year old the other
day he said, mommy, I touched our neighbor's

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:48.081
ball. It's okay. It's okay. He doesn't know
why. We don't want him to do that. It doesn't

00:26:48.081 --> 00:26:53.450
quite understand, but that might linger after
all of this has passed.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.690
Gabby:
Right? Like these kids will grow up thinking

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.630
they can't touch anything.
Vanessa:

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:02.910
It'll be quite interesting. I'm sure it will
affect us and kids and everyone else for quite

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.170
awhile.
Gabby:

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:09.670
Yeah, but I think just taking it day by day
and just trying to help each other out and

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:14.090
being kind and yeah, that's all we can do
really.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.930
Vanessa:
Yeah, I agree. Just sharing kindness is a

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:23.570
great idea. Well thank you so much Gabby for
sharing your thoughts and just kind of what's

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.920
going on in your life because...
Gabby:

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920
Of course...
Vanessa:

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.590
No matter where we live. We're all doing this.
Gabby:

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:34.750
Of course. Yeah. I loved meeting on, online
like this, this is so cool. It's a great substitute

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:39.520
for face to face meetings and you know, we're
not even in the same city so of course we

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.880
would probably do this anyway online. But
it's great.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.910
Vanessa:
A good excuse.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:44.910
Gabby:
Yes.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.000
Vanessa:
Yes. Well thank you so much. I hope everyone

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.540
gets a chance to check out. Go natural English,
YouTube channel.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.540
Gabby:
Thank you!

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.710
Vanessa:
Keep learning, enriching yourself with all

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:58.300
the time that we have now to not go out and
be social. You can learn online.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.330
Gabby:
Yes, thanks so much Vanessa.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.370
Vanessa:
My pleasure. All right, I'm here with Jack

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:09.820
from the wonderful YouTube channel ToFluency
who is another English teacher on the YouTubes,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.440
so thanks for joining me Jack.
Jack:

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.840
Sure thing, Vanessa, glad to be here.
Vanessa:

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:21.540
So we are surprisingly living in the same
city, which is unlike any of the other people

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:27.380
who are in this video. But even though we're
in the same city, we are living different

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:33.960
lives but experiencing the same thing, this
quarantine business. So I'm curious for you,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:40.360
even though they're similar to me, what kind
of regulations or changes have happened for

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:47.500
you over the last month or so since the quarantine
or just the pandemic has been going on?

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.490
Jack:
Yeah, it's hard to think about the timeframe

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:59.660
of it all because I remember there was before
the lockdown happened and the city basically

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:06.720
said, we are implementing these guidelines
at Kate and I had done some of that as well.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:15.480
So we, we were a little bit aware of, we thought
it was going to happen. My son wasn't feeling

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:23.200
very well, so we took him out of school as
a precaution and then suddenly it, it started

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:31.650
and those, those guidelines were something
that I was expecting, and it's been interesting

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:36.890
for me as well to compare them to other cities
around the world and other countries. I'm

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:42.830
from the UK, I live in America. So just like
comparing what everyone is doing in that regard.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.220
Vanessa:
Yeah, and even within the U S it seems like

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.040
different cities and States are dealing with
it in different ways.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.120
Jack:
That's right. And it's interesting also to

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.270
see how cities are dealing with that and then
how that compares to the state and then the

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:04.551
country and the different advice and guidelines
are being passed down. But yeah, I feel in

00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:14.150
terms of the guidelines have been set, they've
been pretty general in terms of what other

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:18.910
people are facing right now. And it started
with no large gatherings and then it started

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.750
to be a little bit more strict with schools
closing. Certain businesses are allowed to

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:29.480
be open and some of that has changed slightly,
but a lot of it is just it's down to essential

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.070
versus non essential.
Vanessa:

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:39.310
Yeah, so you can, there's not a specific amount
of time you can be outside or even saying,

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:44.880
for example, Emma in Australia said that they
can only have gatherings of two people. I

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:50.830
feel like the U S hasn't really implemented
something that specific. It's just don't gather

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:56.490
in large groups of more than 10 or something
a little more vague than other places.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.020
Jack:
Yeah, so a good, a good example is in the

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:08.500
UK you can go outside to exercise once per
day. So you have your very specific hour,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.610
let's say when you can go exercise and the
cracking down on people even just like stop

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:20.420
in and have taking a break. Where as here
there's no general guideline to that. So we're

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:25.460
spending a lot of time outside in our neighborhood,
especially in the yard.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.601
Vanessa:
Especially with kids, you have to get out

00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:30.940
of the house or else you just go stir crazy.
Jack:

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:36.660
Oh yeah. It's bad for everyone. Yeah. And
luckily right now the weather's just incredible.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.620
Vanessa:
I can't imagine if this had happened in the

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.590
middle of the winter, we would be going crazy.
Jack:

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.590
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:49.260
So I'm curious about your daily life. You
kind of hinted, you live in a neighborhood,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.400
you have kids. How has your daily life changed
in the last month or so?

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.100
Jack:
Well, we're, we feel very fortunate that we've

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:06.130
all been healthy throughout this, this period.
And also that I do what I do, which is, similar

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:14.220
to what you do. And my wife also has a job
that allows her to work from home. But with

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:23.140
that, with the two children I'm working, my
wife's working, they have to have schoolwork

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:29.230
done and there's no, there's no way that we
can get childcare at this time. It's been,

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:37.620
it's been a challenge but it, it's actually
been really nice at the same time because,

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.890
Vanessa:
How so?

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:45.790
Jack:
Well part of it is, I can be flexible with

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:53.700
when I work, my wife's school teaching, she
has certain hours that she has to do stuff.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:33:00.370
Our children, it's both good and bad that
the word we have to in regards to them being

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:05.230
able to entertain each other, they have company
cause they can't play with other children.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:09.920
But then when it's, when there are times of
the day when everyone's a little about on

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.510
edge, it's just, it's madness. Just before
dinner time for example, when let's say I'm

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:22.780
trying to finish a video, my wife gets a call
from her lead teacher to say, you know, we

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.350
need this done now. And then the children
are hungry on one of them is tired, one of

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:32.580
them hasn't napped. It's everything like comes
together at one point.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:38.570
Jack:
But we're, we're managing pretty well and

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:43.270
we're actually in a routine that we haven't
been in for a long time because we don't have

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:49.340
to do the school drop off, we don't have to
do certain things that the commitments that

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.430
we have classes, soccer practice or that kind
of stuff.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.200
Vanessa:
Yeah everything has come to a halt.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.590
Jack:
So we, we've just gotten to a really good

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:05.121
routine at the moment that's more or less
working for everyone. And yeah, everyone's

00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:07.630
been quite flexible at the same time.
Vanessa:

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:14.649
It's really great that you guys can flexibly
work and first of all have jobs that are still

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:24.279
continuing but be able to work from home as
well. So what do you think, I guess we should

00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:31.259
say when this is over and not if this is ever
over, but when this is over, what do you think

00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:35.270
the future looks like? What's your prediction?
Jack:

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:43.070
It's, I mean it's very difficult isn't it?
Because we're in very uncertain times and

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:50.119
there are different things to consider with
this. And you know, you, this is from a very

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:54.929
American perspective as well. When I, when
I think about what's going to happen and think

00:34:54.929 --> 00:35:04.249
about the UK, but yeah, it's, I feel that
these lock-downs are going to probably continue

00:35:04.249 --> 00:35:09.290
in terms of it's already been extended as
a lot longer than most people thought.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.290
Vanessa:
Yeah.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.890
Jack:
And then it just seems like everyone is saying

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:18.710
there's going to be that second wave, well,
she's likely going to come in in the fall.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:29.900
So we're preparing in many ways for this to
be extended over the long term. And from that

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:35.980
we, I say we, Kate and I've talked about this
a lot, my wife and I, and we were actually

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:42.260
watching The Big Shore together last night.
Have you seen that movie?

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.530
Vanessa:
No, I haven't.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.690
Jack:
Well it's, it's based on the 2008 crash.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.599
Vanessa:
Oh, okay.

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:52.089
Jack:
But there's certain parts of it where you,

00:35:52.089 --> 00:35:57.049
you watch it and you think this is just like
what's going on at the moment in terms of

00:35:57.049 --> 00:36:03.549
the economy, but also that was during the
SARS outbreak. So there was a scene when one

00:36:03.549 --> 00:36:08.809
of the characters was wearing a mask and they
ridiculed him because he was wearing a mask

00:36:08.809 --> 00:36:16.960
in America. But now that has come around where
we're all being told to wear masks outside.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:25.640
But just to go back to that, I see there's
so many different ways that it can play out

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.799
and you can just take any kind of industry
and think, okay, how's that going to be affected

00:36:29.799 --> 00:36:32.140
and what's the knock on effects of that?
Vanessa:

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.140
Right.
Jack:

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.299
So you can think about the travel industry
and it's very difficult to picture this time

00:36:39.299 --> 00:36:41.740
next year. The travel industry being back
to normal.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.259
Vanessa:
Yeah. Even in a year, who knows what's going

00:36:45.259 --> 00:36:51.220
to happen? What do you think about the education
side of it? Because you have two kids in the

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:57.170
education system there. My kids are too young
for that now. So for you, what do you think

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:03.039
is going to happen with education? Not so
much even will they go back to school in the

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:10.730
fall, but do you think that remote education
will be integrated at all into whatever the

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:16.339
new system is, even if it's completely safe
to go back to school? Just because that's

00:37:16.339 --> 00:37:20.559
what's been going on. They've been remotely
educating for awhile. What do you think about

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:21.559
that?
Jack:

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:26.329
Yeah, I think it's interesting because you
can, some people are seeing the advantages

00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:33.960
to it, where, I mean the biggest advantage
is you don't have to travel and just the fact

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:40.980
that you can work remotely, but at the same
time, I see a lot of frustration with it and

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:47.170
it seems like it's been just, just put onto
people in such a big way that they haven't

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:52.369
had time to ease into this and get used to
the resources available. But what surprised

00:37:52.369 --> 00:38:02.839
me is that how, how good it has been with
the limited time that I've had. So the kind

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:08.340
of resources we're getting from both the schools
that my children go to just been, they've

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:15.140
been excellent and they have enjoyed it. I've
been surprised at how well it's worked. Yeah.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.930
Vanessa:
So they're engaged even though it's just a

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:22.460
screen. Is it the teacher that they see or
did they see all of the students? What's that

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.440
like?
Jack:

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.289
Usually they do it on a grid and they can
see every student. And the benefit of this

00:38:30.289 --> 00:38:37.319
from a teacher point of view is that you can
mute everybody. So then, so instead of when

00:38:37.319 --> 00:38:44.089
you ask a question, you can just say, okay,
so my daughter just had a Spanish lesson and

00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:47.829
she's, she's three and a half, they teach
in preschool. So today's lesson was Spanish

00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:55.009
and I was listening and it was just incredible
because they get everyone to repeat stuff

00:38:55.009 --> 00:38:59.510
and Emma was repeating it and then they'll
unmute Emma and say, all right Emma, how'd

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:07.040
you say it's snowing? And she just said it
and they're completely engaged and my sister's

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:15.050
been given our children lessons as well, doing
craft projects. So they've been for two hours

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:21.270
at a time in front of the screen interacting
with my sister and she's going through all

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:27.080
these different projects that they're doing,
asking questions or having discussions and

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.790
it's, it's, it's been incredible. Some of
that that's been going on.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.099
Vanessa:
That's really sweet too, that your sister

00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:38.579
would do that. I. mean, probably a good way
to connect, but that's so kind.

00:39:38.579 --> 00:39:41.150
Jack:
Oh, everyone's winning because the children

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:46.960
love it. We love it. And she just loves that
she loves to be, you know, with them. So,

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.960
yeah we...
Vanessa:

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:54.839
It's not a bad idea for like remote relationships.
Even for like my two and a half year old.

00:39:54.839 --> 00:40:01.599
Let's do a puzzle together and just pretend
like they're there, but it's just a screen.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:04.130
Jack:
Yeah. And if you're going to .

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.130
Vanessa:
It's a screen.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.130
Jack:
Yeah. And if you're going to do that, I recommend

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:13.220
having a computer setup and then sitting down
at a desk because we found any type of Zoom

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:18.010
time with my sister on a phone just turns
into a battle where they're both trying to

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:20.890
get it and they're holding it, they want to
be over here, they want to be over there and

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.690
it keeps them centered.
Vanessa:

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:27.839
Sure. It's already fixed on the desk. This
is where you're going to stay. That's really

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:31.989
interesting. I'm kind of surprised. Maybe
just sounds like you were a little surprised

00:40:31.989 --> 00:40:37.489
too that they're actually engaged with the
class or with your sister doing projects because

00:40:37.489 --> 00:40:42.940
you'd kind of think that maybe it's not for
everyone, but that most kids would just think,

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.810
"Oh no one's here. I can do whatever I want."
Jack:

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:54.181
Yeah, I think the craving that kind of interaction
too, the type of work where they have to work

00:40:54.181 --> 00:40:58.109
through things on their own. You can tell
they're not as engaged into that and you have

00:40:58.109 --> 00:41:04.619
to be with them and try and lead them down.
But when it's a class they're definitely engaged.

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:07.020
Vanessa:
Yeah. I guess that's a kind of thing that

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:13.200
I've heard as kind of a complaint about this
remote learning is it's not really homeschooling

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.730
because that would mean you're coming up with
the curriculum as the parent, but you're kind

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:24.160
of just the intermediary. You're being given
the information, which could be a little tough,

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.059
but sounds like kind of working for you guys
so far.

00:41:28.059 --> 00:41:32.700
Jack:
Well, yeah to the best of its ability. I mean,

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.789
everyone needs this space.
Vanessa:

00:41:34.789 --> 00:41:38.079
Is that possible?
Jack:

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:47.050
Not really, no. It's very difficult to get
that time, but then it's just shown that people

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:52.319
are having to get creative and to do things
in different ways. So for me, I want to have

00:41:52.319 --> 00:41:58.569
certain time to exercise. If I start exercising,
like, "Oh, I'm just going to sneak off and

00:41:58.569 --> 00:42:04.749
do something," then within two minutes they're
jumping on my back if I'm doing pushups. But

00:42:04.749 --> 00:42:09.789
then you just have to think how can you get
them involved so everyone's doing things together.

00:42:09.789 --> 00:42:14.259
Vanessa:
Sure. A level of creativity and patience has

00:42:14.259 --> 00:42:15.930
to double.
Jack:

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.410
Yeah.
Vanessa:

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:25.380
Well, very interesting to hear how things
are going even just across the city from me.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.950
So thank you so much, Jack, for sharing about
your daily life, your predictions for the

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:35.170
future. I'm curious to hear what other people
from around the world, especially with kids,

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:41.049
have experience with remote learning and all
of that. Every country does it a little differently,

00:42:41.049 --> 00:42:42.880
but kids are still kids.
Jack:

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.810
Yeah, I think a lot depends as well on the
parent's job. So Kate and I are a little bit

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:57.150
more flexible and we can spend more time with
them. But I know people who are having to

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.249
do that while having to log 10 hours a day
at home.

00:43:01.249 --> 00:43:02.249
Vanessa:
Oh my goodness.

00:43:02.249 --> 00:43:05.700
Jack:
And I see them at the end of the day and-

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.059
Vanessa:
That is impossible.

00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:11.599
Jack:
It's impossible, that's the thing. And that's

00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:17.900
why I feel very fortunate that we can be flexible
and spend that time with them.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.049
Vanessa:
Yeah, for sure and for those people it would

00:43:21.049 --> 00:43:26.000
be the perfect time for them to be able to
have a babysitter come over. But we can't

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.180
do that.
Jack:

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.180
Exactly yeah.
Vanessa:

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:35.960
Kind of this strange cycle. But we are all
pushing through. So thank you so much for

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.430
sharing Jack. I appreciate it.
Jack:

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:38.430
My pleasure.
Vanessa:

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:42.829
Anyone who hasn't found Jack's YouTube channel
yet, make sure you check it out and continue

00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:47.770
learning to use this free time to have remote
education. All of us are doing it well.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.220
Jack:
Yeah, well thank you.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.900
Vanessa:
Well thanks so much and I'll talk to you later.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.900
Jack:
Yeah. Bye-bye.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.099
Vanessa:
Bye. All right, I am here with the wonderful

00:43:57.099 --> 00:43:59.910
Lucy from English with Lucy. The wonderful-
Lucy:

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:00.960
Hello.
Vanessa:

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.460
Thanks so much for joining me.
Lucy:

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.410
Thank you for having me. It's such an honor
to be here.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:09.319
Vanessa:
Oh it's my honor to talk with you. So even

00:44:09.319 --> 00:44:13.920
though you are living far away on the other
side of the ocean, we are experiencing some

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:20.890
similar circumstances as is probably everyone
watching this. So I'm curious in this strange

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:27.869
quarantine times, what kind of regulations
or changes have happened where you live? First

00:44:27.869 --> 00:44:32.950
of all, where do you live and then what kind
of changes have happened in your area?

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:37.710
Lucy:
So I live in Bedfordshire, which is a county

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:46.050
near London in England. And there have been
quite a few changes. But I will say from the

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:53.329
beginning that I live on a farm in England.
So some of the changes haven't quite reached

00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:59.599
me. So life is quite unaffected compared to
how other people's lives are affected.

00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:02.619
Vanessa:
So you're not in the middle of a city in a

00:45:02.619 --> 00:45:03.619
small apartment?
Lucy:

00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:10.200
No, and when we do have to drive to a city
or a town, it's unbelievable how different

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.970
everything is. It feels like the apocalypse.
Vanessa:

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:16.010
No one's anywhere.
Lucy:

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:21.710
Yeah, and I think one big thing is that people
don't make eye contact as if that's going

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:25.180
to spread the disease.
Vanessa:

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:29.029
The virus will shoot out of your eyes. I'm
going to get you.

00:45:29.029 --> 00:45:32.339
Lucy:
Yeah. So we are you being told in America

00:45:32.339 --> 00:45:35.640
to stay six feet apart?
Vanessa:

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.750
Yes.
Lucy:

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:43.099
But we use the metric system, so we're being
told two meters apart, which I think is similar.

00:45:43.099 --> 00:45:44.440
Vanessa:
About the same, yeah.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.299
Lucy:
Yeah. I've forgotten, whereabouts are you?

00:45:47.299 --> 00:45:50.030
Vanessa:
I live on the east coast in North Carolina,

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:56.589
so it's not even a big city, but still it's
pretty deserted like any city I guess in the

00:45:56.589 --> 00:46:02.869
UK too. But strange thing to have to stay
away from people, especially people that you

00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:08.980
previously knew. All of a sudden they have
something and you have to avoid them.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.480
Lucy:
Yeah, and everybody has different standards

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:17.409
of how seriously they're taking the recommendations.
So it's kind of awkward at first like, "Are

00:46:17.409 --> 00:46:24.079
we doing the two meters? Are we're doing more?"
But I guess my biggest problem at the moment

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:27.450
is I'm really missing my mom.
Vanessa:

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:30.220
Oh sure. So generally even families aren't
really getting together if you don't know

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.460
live together?
Lucy:

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:38.239
No. You have to stick with your household.
So, for anyone that's not in your household,

00:46:38.239 --> 00:46:41.410
you're not allowed to visit them. If you do
bump into each other, you've got to be two

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:47.710
meters apart. If I wanted to go on a walk
outside of the farm then I would be able to

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.880
go with my fiance Will, but that would be
it.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.460
Vanessa:
Oh, interesting. So that's actually a regulation

00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:01.220
that you can't meet with people because here
it's not a regulation that you can't, but

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.950
it's generally suggested.
Lucy:

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.190
It's funny isn't it?
Vanessa:

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.559
So we are together sometimes but-
Lucy:

00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:11.069
Yeah, I think it's hard for them to tell us
absolutely don't do this. I think there's

00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:19.029
a lot of ethical boundaries maybe, but we're
advised no meetings of more than two people,

00:47:19.029 --> 00:47:25.130
but we're also advised to not mix with other
households. So it's a bit hard to understand,

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:31.289
but there've been lots of really good things
our government has done because we've obviously

00:47:31.289 --> 00:47:39.150
got a lot of people that now can't go to work.
You're only allowed to go to work if it's

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:44.900
essential or if you can still maintain the,
what's it called? Self-isolation.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.309
Vanessa:
Oh sure. If you can still self-isolate while

00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:49.480
you're working.
Lucy:

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.589
Yeah. Whilst you're working. So for example,
gardeners can still work and window cleaners

00:47:54.589 --> 00:48:00.180
can still work as long as they don't have
contact, but they are doing something which

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:06.670
is called furloughing, which is a word that
I've just learnt. I've never had written before.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:16.170
But it's basically, if you have to stop working
the government will pay up to 80% of your

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:25.329
monthly salary up to £2,850 a month I think.
Which is a lot. That's a high salary.

00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:28.079
Vanessa:
You can survive and probably not change much

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.079
of your lifestyle.
Lucy:

00:48:29.079 --> 00:48:36.180
Yeah. So for anyone who is employed by someone,
if their employer is choosing to put them

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:41.680
on this scheme, employee has to pay them now,
but then they can claim back the money later

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:47.910
from the government. So I'm surprised that
the government have been so generous with

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.420
that figure, but I think it's really good.
Vanessa:

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.960
Yeah. People in the US don't listen to that.
Lucy:

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.310
No, no sorry.
Vanessa:

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.660
They’ll get jealous.
Lucy:

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:03.319
But it's not good for everyone because we
have a lot of self-employed people and there

00:49:03.319 --> 00:49:07.520
are quite specific regulations on who can
claim.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.040
Vanessa:
Talking about being self-employed, I imagine

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.920
that's the category you fall under.
Lucy:

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:21.089
Yeah, I'm a company and I employ myself. But
I'm not taking any money from the government

00:49:21.089 --> 00:49:23.520
because my business isn't really affected
by this.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.230
Vanessa:
Sure. So has your daily life been affected

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:30.510
much? You said you live far enough away from
the city, but I guess you still go to the

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:33.859
grocery store and places like that when you
need to?

00:49:33.859 --> 00:49:39.960
Lucy:
So my whole world hasn't changed too much.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:47.490
Honestly, I lived quite a solitary life anyway
because we live on a farm. My fiance's a farmer,

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:53.480
I work from home and anyone who I do work
with, I work with remotely. So over emails

00:49:53.480 --> 00:50:00.999
and Skype and things like that. And I also
never ever go to the supermarket because I

00:50:00.999 --> 00:50:07.190
have a shopping delivery because the closest
supermarket is still 30 minutes away. So that's

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:13.270
a long round trip. I'd have to take out a
whole afternoon to do a week shop. So normally

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:19.650
at 7:30 on a Monday morning I have a shopping
delivery. But this has been quite difficult

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.490
since the lockdown's come in.
Vanessa:

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.359
Sure, everyone wants that now.
Lucy:

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:28.119
Everyone wants it and the prime minister,
before he became ill he was doing a daily

00:50:28.119 --> 00:50:34.769
broadcast in the afternoon and one day he
said, "And I really recommend that everyone

00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:37.640
uses online delivery services." Explosions
everywhere.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.720
Vanessa:
Wow.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:45.249
Lucy:
I was in a queue. I tried to go on to edit

00:50:45.249 --> 00:50:51.259
an order that I've made and I was number 63,000
in a queue to get onto the website.

00:50:51.259 --> 00:50:52.549
Vanessa:
What? 63,000?

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:58.210
Lucy:
Yes, it was overloaded and then the orders

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:03.700
that we had made didn't arrive, so it was
chaos. So now they're doing priority customers,

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:10.839
so people who are vulnerable, definitely people
who are older, people who have underlying

00:51:10.839 --> 00:51:18.480
health conditions and people that maybe are
a single parent, but with children they are

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:24.200
meant to be given the priority. Sometimes
it's not reaching them. So I am going to the

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.320
supermarket now.
Vanessa:

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.079
So this is the new life you're actually going
back into.

00:51:29.079 --> 00:51:30.400
Lucy:
Yeah.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.109
Vanessa:
When you go to the store or other places that

00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:39.589
are more public like that, are people wearing
masks and gloves or what's that like? Because

00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:41.729
I know that's a little different everywhere.
Lucy:

00:51:41.729 --> 00:51:46.910
Yeah. It's funny because masks aren't a part
of our culture, I know in some countries,

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:53.390
especially in Asia, wearing a mask is quite
normal, but it's not a part of our culture.

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:58.999
And so no one really has them. And if we do
have them then they're not necessarily the

00:51:58.999 --> 00:52:04.759
right ones. So Will, my fiance, gave me a
mask to wear and I was like, "Will, this is

00:52:04.759 --> 00:52:09.829
a dust mask for doing woodwork. I don't think
that's going to do much." But he made me wear

00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:15.150
it anyway and I did go to the supermarket
and there was a huge queue outside of people

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:20.819
two meters apart and it looked really low,
but actually because it was so spaced out,

00:52:20.819 --> 00:52:26.450
it went down quite quickly and they're doing
it so that there's a limited amount of people

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:33.410
allowed in the shop at each time. And yeah,
it did take a long time because also you don't

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:38.670
want to crowd someone. If I want to look at
the tomatoes, but someone is already looking

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:43.729
at the tomatoes. I have to wait my turn. It's
an interesting experience and I try not to

00:52:43.729 --> 00:52:45.559
go too often.
Vanessa:

00:52:45.559 --> 00:52:51.009
Yeah, it does seem like it's meant to help,
at the same time, a little inconvenient. Here

00:52:51.009 --> 00:52:55.589
they've put arrows on the ground in grocery
stores so that you have to follow certain

00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:57.300
patterns. It's a recent thing.
Lucy:

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.700
What the fuck?
Vanessa:

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:04.670
Yeah, I haven't been to the store in maybe
two months. I don't know. It's been forever.

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:10.380
My husband's been going, either I was really,
really pregnant or just had a newborn. So

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:16.700
it made sense for him to go anyway. But I've
heard that if you, for example, want a bag

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.319
to put the apples in, you have to follow the
arrows all the way to the other side to get

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:25.640
the bag and then follow the arrows. So it's
maybe not so intuitive right now, but the

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.769
idea is nice.
Lucy:

00:53:27.769 --> 00:53:35.289
Oh my God. Yeah. It's been interesting to
see how it's just slowly changed and the restrictions

00:53:35.289 --> 00:53:38.700
are getting stronger and stronger because
at first I don't think we all really believed

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:44.440
that it was going to be such a big deal. I
remember saying myself back in March like,

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:50.339
"It'd be fine. I think it'd be fine." But
now, yes were not fine.

00:53:50.339 --> 00:53:51.990
Vanessa:
It's serious.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:57.490
Lucy:
Yes. But we definitely have to stay far away

00:53:57.490 --> 00:54:05.039
from the cashier. The person that's, what
do you call the cashier in America?

00:54:05.039 --> 00:54:06.180
Vanessa:
The cashier.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.339
Lucy:
Okay. Store clerk, isn't it that?

00:54:08.339 --> 00:54:12.329
Vanessa:
It kind of feels a little old fashioned. And

00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:17.819
maybe in the official title it says, "I'm
a store clerk," but yeah, cashiers. Do they

00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:24.150
have any kind of barrier? I know some places
have put up a glass barrier at the bank or

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:25.150
something.
Lucy:

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:31.089
Yeah, we do have that actually. Yeah we do.
One thing that's become really popular that

00:54:31.089 --> 00:54:37.259
I think is really good is well because people
are struggling to find the food they want

00:54:37.259 --> 00:54:43.259
in the supermarkets and also to get the delivery
slots. We are or people in general in the

00:54:43.259 --> 00:54:51.509
UK are using local providers more. So obviously
I'm a farmer's wife to be, so I'm very passionate

00:54:51.509 --> 00:54:57.049
using farm shops, but all the local farm shops
are noticing booming trade and they're doing,

00:54:57.049 --> 00:55:02.660
you can phone them up to say what you want
and they'll pack a box and pass it over the

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:07.400
fence to you. The local butchers are doing
deliveries and all of these kind of service

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:11.670
providers that were overlooked before, like
milkman. I don't know if you have milk delivery

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:14.250
services in the US.
Vanessa:

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.359
No, but that sounds really quaint and amazing.
Lucy:

00:55:18.359 --> 00:55:19.859
In little glass bottles.
Vanessa:

00:55:19.859 --> 00:55:22.020
Is that a real service?
Lucy:

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:27.219
Oh yeah, the milk man. It's a running joke
in my village that my mom had an affair with

00:55:27.219 --> 00:55:34.239
the milkman because I'm blonde and so is the
milkman and my dad isn't. But that's not true.

00:55:34.239 --> 00:55:39.989
Vanessa:
Usually we just say the mailman like, "Oh

00:55:39.989 --> 00:55:42.040
you look like the m-"
Lucy:

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.589
Yeah, exactly. No, and we've always used a
milkman. He's very nice and well loved in

00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:47.589
the village.
Vanessa:

00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:55.950
I imagine he is well loved. It kind of reminds
me of something that might have happened at

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.250
the turn of the century.
Lucy:

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:03.609
They use electric milk floats now, so the
little vans that they drive are electric.

00:56:03.609 --> 00:56:06.789
So you don't hear them. They're just *vroom*.
They're very modest.

00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:09.430
Vanessa:
The mysterious milk coming, arriving at your

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:10.430
door.
Lucy:

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:15.479
Yeah. It's a really good low carbon footprint
because you have driven to you in an electric

00:56:15.479 --> 00:56:17.140
van from a local dairy.
Vanessa:

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.249
Oh, that's cool.
Lucy:

00:56:18.249 --> 00:56:23.760
Brilliant. Yeah and they bring goods and services
and so milkman were in decline and now-

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:27.039
Vanessa:
The business to be in.

00:56:27.039 --> 00:56:29.249
Lucy:
Yeah, curiously it's cool.

00:56:29.249 --> 00:56:31.829
Vanessa:
Yeah, I'm curious to hear if other people

00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:37.019
from other countries too, if local businesses,
especially food businesses have gained in

00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:43.009
popularity because that is true. People want
to avoid going to stores and it's maybe more

00:56:43.009 --> 00:56:47.319
convenient to get something. You have a CSA
type programs?

00:56:47.319 --> 00:56:48.729
Lucy:
What's that?

00:56:48.729 --> 00:56:52.500
Vanessa:
You get like a weekly box of vegetables usually

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.529
from a farm and you sign up for a membership
and they-

00:56:56.529 --> 00:56:58.180
Lucy:
Yes. Lots of those around.

00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.900
Vanessa:
Community supported agriculture I think is

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:01.900
what it stands for.
Lucy:

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.900
Oh okay.
Vanessa:

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.970
But you can say sign up for something like
that.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:07.609
Lucy:
I mean there are lots of farms that do vegetable

00:57:07.609 --> 00:57:11.930
boxes. They're normally run by farm shops.
There's a really successful one that's near

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:16.579
us. They have a barn that they sell the food
for them and then they also do deliveries

00:57:16.579 --> 00:57:23.829
on a certain day. Yeah, and they've been,
I mean it's a luxury now if you get stuff

00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:27.710
with them because they're so popular. No,
it's really cool. I'm really glad that people

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:34.740
are going back and are happy to pay a little
bit more for something that is more local

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:40.109
and kind of meat that's being responsibly
produced as well. I like that.

00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:42.289
Vanessa:
Sure, and not transported halfway across the

00:57:42.289 --> 00:57:43.680
globe.
Lucy:

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.660
Yeah, that is good because the moment we're
noticing in our supermarkets that we get a

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:56.630
lot of meat from New Zealand, which couldn't
be further. Yeah. So it is nice that people

00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.210
are using British products more.
Vanessa:

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:05.720
That's a pleasant positive turn of events.
And that kind of leads to my final question

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.660
because I'm curious what you think is going
to happen after all this passes, but even

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:17.219
with food, do you think people will continue
to go to those local shops after all of this

00:58:17.219 --> 00:58:20.289
main part of the pandemic has passed? What's
your prediction?

00:58:20.289 --> 00:58:24.579
Lucy:
I think so. I think so because it's about

00:58:24.579 --> 00:58:29.319
forming a habit isn't it? And once you get
used to something, it becomes kind of just

00:58:29.319 --> 00:58:36.670
part of your day or your week. I really hope
that food delivery services, whether they're

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:43.170
from supermarkets or from local providers
become more popular because instead of lots

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:47.450
of families all driving to the supermarket
and coming home, it's just one van doing a

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:53.329
calculated route, which I think is quite good.
Clears up the roads, because that's one thing

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:58.309
we've noticed. The roads had been so clear.
I walk my dog normally with a lead, but I

00:58:58.309 --> 00:59:01.210
don't even have to do now because there are
no cars around.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:04.739
Vanessa:
So even now in a rural area there's noticeably

00:59:04.739 --> 00:59:05.869
less traffic?
Lucy:

00:59:05.869 --> 00:59:14.341
Oh yeah. Way less, but there are a lot more,
I wonder if you know what this is, MAMILS.

00:59:14.341 --> 00:59:16.469
Vanessa:
Is this a different way to say mammals?

00:59:16.469 --> 00:59:21.890
Lucy:
No. It's M-A-M-I-L-S. It's something that

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:28.430
is a recent phenomenon. It's the middle-aged
men in Lycra.

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:32.809
Vanessa:
This is an actual acronym?

00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:35.720
Lucy:
Yeah. You'll hear it mentioned on the radio.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:41.059
People are getting really annoyed about the
amount of MAMILS because men, it seems to

00:59:41.059 --> 00:59:46.529
be predominantly males but there are lots
of females as well, have taken to cycling.

00:59:46.529 --> 00:59:50.119
But it's unbelievable. There are so many of
them.

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:52.789
Vanessa:
All of a sudden everyone just pulled their

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:55.809
bike out of the garage or out of somewhere
to-

00:59:55.809 --> 01:00:00.230
Lucy:
Oil it up, squeezed into their Lycra and yeah,

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.230
they're going everywhere. And so we've been
told by the government-

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.230
Lucy:
And yeah, that going everywhere and I think

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:07.239
it's, so we've been told by the government
that we're allowed one hour of exercise per

01:00:07.239 --> 01:00:13.109
day. It's either one exercise session or one
hour long session, I can't remember. And people

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:16.700
are taking that really seriously. Like they
feel like they deserve that hour. They're

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.829
entitled to the hour -
Vanessa:

01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:21.700
And if you're wearing Lycra, maybe that should
be like 30 minutes.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:27.269
Lucy:
Then my mother, my dad once bought a pair

01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:33.279
of Lycra shorts for running in, which you
should never run in lycra shorts, and she

01:00:33.279 --> 01:00:39.160
cut out the crotch area so when he put them
on he couldn't wear them.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.450
Vanessa:
She did that just so that he couldn't wear

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:43.450
them?
Lucy:

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:46.319
Yes. Not for any other reason.
Lucy:

01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:51.480
He wouldn't wear them. So he put them on and
she'd ruined them. And it actually was a big

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.869
issue in our house for awhile. He was really
upset, but she hated them so much and he wasn't

01:00:55.869 --> 01:00:56.869
listening.
Vanessa:

01:00:56.869 --> 01:01:02.369
Oh man. What are you going to do, how are
you going to dissuade him from doing this?

01:01:02.369 --> 01:01:04.220
Only one way.
Lucy:

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:11.680
I know! Everyone else thought that day yet.
Yeah. I wonder if people are going to maintain

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:18.710
the social distancing regulation? Like not
shaking hands, not kissing. I'm quite happy

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:24.000
with that. The less I have to touch people,
the better.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.470
Vanessa:
Yeah. It seems like there's been so many,

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:32.739
at least for me because I have a newborn.
My neighbors are dying to hold him and like

01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:34.280
be close and -
Lucy:

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.450
Yes.
Vanessa:

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:42.150
So I, it will be a little bit weird though
when this passes to feel like it's okay because

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:45.239
maybe it's not and we felt like it wasn't
okay for so long.

01:01:45.239 --> 01:01:49.660
Lucy:
Yes. Because I hear that one thing, especially

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.089
with newborn babies, is people want to kiss
them.

01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:55.809
Vanessa:
Impossible not to kiss the little cheeks.

01:01:55.809 --> 01:02:00.410
Lucy:
Ah the cheeks. I love the cheeks. And then

01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:03.049
also when they look like they have elastic
bands around their wrists, you know when they

01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:05.219
get chubby.
Vanessa:

01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:12.680
He has the little baby rolls. But yeah, it's
going to be weird to feel like we don't have

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:18.239
some kind of complex after this. Like, Oh,
is this okay? And not be kind of traumatized.

01:02:18.239 --> 01:02:21.519
Lucy:
Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be weird. I wonder

01:02:21.519 --> 01:02:25.680
how long this will go on for. We're meant
to be getting married in September.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.250
Vanessa:
Oh. I hope by then.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:32.680
Lucy:
Fingers crossed. We can postpone it. There's

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:39.510
no issue. But I've been growing my hair, especially
for the wedding and I'm really getting tired

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:40.609
of it.
Vanessa:

01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:43.670
You can only take a couple more months.
Lucy:

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:49.970
It's started tickling the bottom of my back
now and if it goes any further.

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:52.559
Vanessa:
Yeah, if you postpone until next year, you're

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:57.039
going to have world's longest hair flowing
behind you. You don't even need a veil.

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:59.660
Lucy:
Especially as all the, Oh, this is something

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:05.440
funny actually, that's happened during lockdown.
Men can't get their hair cut. Now women, it

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.789
doesn't matter that much, apart from maybe
the roots I think some women are struggling

01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:11.660
with, but all the men have started shaving
their heads.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.589
Vanessa:
Oh, shaving their heads, really?

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:16.999
Lucy:
It's only been a couple of weeks. How fast

01:03:16.999 --> 01:03:21.999
does their hair grow? But they've all been
putting it on their social media and some

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:27.039
girlfriends seem to be better at it than others.
Some kind of lawn mower stripes.

01:03:27.039 --> 01:03:30.730
Vanessa:
This has not caught on in the US yet, but

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:35.029
we're usually a couple of weeks behind. So
maybe in a couple weeks that will happen.

01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:39.269
Vanessa:
Oh yeah, I saw a funny picture that was like

01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:45.240
a little comic and it showed men lining up
to go to a barber shop after this is finished

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.430
and everyone had crazy hair and the barber
was just in shock. How am I going to deal

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:55.099
with this? Because that's all you can do.
Lucy:

01:03:55.099 --> 01:04:02.779
Will is starting to feel it a little bit,
I think it was like back in 2007, 2008 when

01:04:02.779 --> 01:04:10.910
men had like sweeping side fringes and stuff
and they click it like this. He's starting

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:16.539
to look a little bit early two thousands for
my liking and his liking, but we'll get through

01:04:16.539 --> 01:04:17.980
this difficult time.
Vanessa:

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.019
Because it's either that or shave your head.
So we've got two options.

01:04:21.019 --> 01:04:23.560
Lucy:
No. He can't shave it just in case the wedding

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.089
does go ahead. No, we're not doing that.
Vanessa:

01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:35.840
Wow. Well thank you so much for sharing your
life and thoughts and predictions. We'll see

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.960
what happens. Hopefully your wedding can still
happen and Will won't resort to having to

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.430
shave his head.
Lucy:

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.109
Pray for me.
Vanessa:

01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:45.599
Or you.
Lucy:

01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:50.209
Yeah, I know it's lovely to talk. Thank you
for having me on.

01:04:50.209 --> 01:04:52.989
Vanessa:
Oh, my pleasure. I hope you continue to have

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:57.910
an okay quarantine there on a lovely farm.
At least you've got some nice space outside

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:58.930
to roam freely.
Lucy:

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:04.319
Yeah, it's good. We are in a fortunate position.
I really do feel for people who don't have

01:05:04.319 --> 01:05:09.509
any outside space and people with animals
who don't have outside space because that

01:05:09.509 --> 01:05:15.680
must be so frustrating having to tell your
dog like I'm so sorry, but we can't. Because

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.710
you can't explain to a dog, can you?
Vanessa:

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.059
Yeah, I didn't even think about that with
with dogs.

01:05:19.059 --> 01:05:21.479
Vanessa:
I was just thinking about the crazed three

01:05:21.479 --> 01:05:23.709
year old children running around in an apartment
going insane.

01:05:23.709 --> 01:05:25.690
Lucy:
Yeah, how do you explain to like a two year

01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:33.630
old, no we can't go to the park. My dogs become
really entitled. I mean cause I've been going

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:38.410
out quite a lot on a run in the morning and
like another walk in the evening just because

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:42.539
even though my life hasn't changed, I feel
like I should make the most of it and that

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:47.210
now at like seven o'clock if I haven't taken
him on his additional walk, he like gets all

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.609
up in my face.
Vanessa:

01:05:48.609 --> 01:05:50.820
I deserve this now.
Lucy:

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.540
Yeah, poor old me. Mom!
Vanessa:

01:05:54.540 --> 01:06:00.009
So maybe dogs that have space are the real
winners here. They get all the attention,

01:06:00.009 --> 01:06:01.720
all the time.
Lucy:

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.119
Yes, definitely.
Vanessa:

01:06:04.119 --> 01:06:05.479
Well, thank you Lucy.
Lucy:

01:06:05.479 --> 01:06:06.479
You're welcome!
Vanessa:

01:06:06.479 --> 01:06:11.059
I really appreciate your time. For those of
you who may be one person out there in the

01:06:11.059 --> 01:06:17.289
world who has not yet run across your channel,
go check out Lucy's channel. Yeah, I appreciate

01:06:17.289 --> 01:06:21.890
it. Thanks so much for your time. I hope we
can chat again soon in the future.

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:24.569
Lucy:
Yeah, it'd be lovely to catch up. Maybe post-quarantine

01:06:24.569 --> 01:06:26.539
and see how things change again. Yes.
Vanessa:

01:06:26.539 --> 01:06:29.630
Yes. See what has happened on the hair front.
Lucy:

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:32.440
Yeah, I'll be back.
Vanessa:

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:38.069
Well, thanks so much. I'll talk to you later.
Lucy:

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:40.319
All right, bye.
Vanessa:

01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:41.450
Bye.
Vanessa:

01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:43.650
My final guest is my husband. Dan.
Dan:

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:44.650
Hello.
Vanessa:

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:45.650
Thanks so much for joining me.
Dan:

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:46.650
You're welcome.
Vanessa:

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:50.819
We have a couple minutes of silence in our
house, so I thought that we would -

01:06:50.819 --> 01:06:52.160
Dan:
I know, it's a miracle.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
Vanessa:
I know.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.930
Dan:
Except Theo did just start crying a little

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.099
bit, but hopefully he'll keep it down.
Vanessa:

01:06:57.099 --> 01:07:02.690
Hopefully we can a little conversation for
a couple minutes talking about the world situation

01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:09.420
that we find ourselves in with the virus and
a lockdown, kind of quarantine situation.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:15.559
So would you like to explain a little bit
about any kind of regulations or changes that

01:07:15.559 --> 01:07:19.299
have happened in our city or in the US lately?
Dan:

01:07:19.299 --> 01:07:24.450
Yeah. I think in our state, it's been a little
bit more lax than some places.

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:25.450
Vanessa:
North Carolina?

01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:27.930
Dan:
North Carolina. So they're still allowing

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:32.940
essential businesses to be open, which it's
a little bit loosey-goosey on what that means

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.940
exactly.
Vanessa:

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.940
Loosey-goosey?
Dan:

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:38.599
Loosey-goosey. Yeah. It's a little unclear,
although, I mean there's still restaurants

01:07:38.599 --> 01:07:45.960
open, but you have to drive up and pick up
the food and do takeout. You can't go into

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.119
the restaurant.
Vanessa:

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:54.390
It is official that restaurants have to close
businesses. I think the rule in North Carolina

01:07:54.390 --> 01:08:00.910
was, or at least in our County, is that if
you are in contact with someone for 10 minutes

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:06.839
or more, so if you are a haircutter, if you
are a massage therapist, like a tattoo artists,

01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:09.700
these kinds of jobs, then you can't do your
job.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:10.799
Dan:
And this is statewide.

01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.549
Vanessa:
Yes. So every state's different.

01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:13.549
Dan:
Yeah.

01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:14.950
Vanessa:
Every city or county kind of has some different

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:19.710
rules. But something I noticed that's different
in the US, at least where we live compared

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:25.569
to some of the other interviews that you just
watched with other countries, is that we don't

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:31.549
have a specific rule that says you can only
be with two people. So only two people can

01:08:31.549 --> 01:08:32.549
be together.
Dan:

01:08:32.549 --> 01:08:33.549
Oh.
Vanessa:

01:08:33.549 --> 01:08:34.839
So Emma mentioned that in Australia -
Dan:

01:08:34.839 --> 01:08:36.080
That seems really intense.
Vanessa:

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.929
There's a specific rule that says you can
only be in groups of two people or a family.

01:08:40.929 --> 01:08:45.369
And then Lucy mentioned that in the UK too,
but we do not have that rule.

01:08:45.369 --> 01:08:47.469
Dan:
Yeah, I think that's too far, personally.

01:08:47.469 --> 01:08:50.190
Vanessa:
It's a little, that is quite strict.

01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:51.190
Dan:
Yeah.

01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:53.650
Vanessa:
But in the UK they also had a rule that said

01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:59.219
you can only exercise outside. So outside
your personal property for one hour, go for

01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:03.859
a bike ride, go for a run for one hour per
day. And in the US we do not have this.

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:05.679
Dan:
Yeah. Although they are closing down a lot

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:12.000
of public spaces, which is a little annoying
to me because they closed down our local park.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.099
And to me, I feel like if you're outside,
that's a lot better than being closed inside

01:09:16.099 --> 01:09:20.609
with somebody. It's better for people's mental
health and wellbeing to be outside and be

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:25.790
able to use these spaces like the walking
trail around our lake, you know, if somebody

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:32.240
is not exactly six feet, that's not the end
of the world, in my opinion, when they're

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.460
walking outside.
Vanessa:

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:37.730
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think that it is interesting
because we live in the mountains and I mentioned

01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:42.700
with some of the other interviews that they've
closed the national park, which means you

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.049
can't go on a hike. Usually you see nobody
when you go hiking.

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.170
Dan:
A lot of times, yeah.

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:51.069
Vanessa:
But you can't go into the national park. I

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:54.980
understand closing playgrounds and any kind
of equipment that you touch.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:55.980
Dan:
Yeah.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.699
Vanessa:
But it's quite difficult for people who have

01:09:59.699 --> 01:10:05.810
no outdoor space to find somewhere to be able
to go for a walk or go for a run. If you have

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.389
a dog, it'd probably be really challenging.
Dan:

01:10:07.389 --> 01:10:11.260
Yeah, we're really fortunate that we have
a nice open backyard and that we can spend

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:15.730
a lot of time outside and even though it's
the same space over and over again, you know,

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:20.280
we still have a lot of fun just walking around
our neighborhood or being in our backyard.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.400
Vanessa:
Yeah. So I'm curious, how has your and mine

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.780
subsequently, daily life changed then? All
these regulations, how much did they change

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:32.950
your life in the last month or so?
Dan:

01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:37.469
Yeah, so technically it hasn't changed that
much because we already worked from home and

01:10:37.469 --> 01:10:40.980
do a lot of stuff at home, but it still feels
like a lot.

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:41.980
Vanessa:
Yeah.

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.030
Dan:
Like maybe just even just the mental weight

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:49.550
of knowing that if I go to the grocery store,
I have to ... for a long time, like before

01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:53.900
in America it's a little different than some
other countries, they thought it's not a big

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.052
deal to wear a mask. But right from the beginning
I thought, yeah, it's a good idea to wear

01:10:58.052 --> 01:10:59.052
a mask.
Vanessa:

01:10:59.052 --> 01:11:00.300
Yeah, you've been wearing a mask for a long
time.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.739
Dan:
But you'll get looked at really funny in America

01:11:02.739 --> 01:11:06.260
if you do that, but not anymore. It's starting
to become more accepted.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.210
Vanessa:
In the last like two weeks or so.

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:09.210
Dan:
Yeah.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:10.210
Vanessa:
Everyone's started.

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.210
Dan:
But it's just kind of like a mental weight

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:14.460
to be walking around like "Ooh, who's touched
that?", "Who's done that?" And it's just kind

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:19.300
of like gotten to you psychologically. And
then of course there's other things like places

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:24.550
that we normally go, like the library, that's
closed. A lot of the public parks that we

01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:26.179
go to that's closed.
Vanessa:

01:11:26.179 --> 01:11:37.869
I think that also about one month ago when
you watch this, we had a new baby. So a lot

01:11:37.869 --> 01:11:43.780
in our personal lives has changed. But some
things such as our family wants to come visit

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.780
our baby.
Dan:

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.780
Yeah.
Vanessa:

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:51.490
My family hasn't been able to visit our baby
yet and it would be really nice if our babysitter

01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:53.500
could come to watch our two year old.
Dan:

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.500
Yes.
Vanessa:

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.489
But she can't come to watch our two-year-old.
Dan:

01:11:56.489 --> 01:11:59.550
Well, she could, but it's not advisable.
Vanessa:

01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:05.530
Legally she can, but most people are choosing
not to do those types of interactions unless

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:08.710
they're absolutely necessary. And it would
just be nice. It's not necessary.

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:10.719
Dan:
Yeah, so that's not against the law yet.

01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:11.719
Vanessa:
Yeah.

01:12:11.719 --> 01:12:13.090
Dan:
I hope it's not personally.

01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:15.400
Vanessa:
But that's something that we choose not to

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.630
do. But those are things that have changed
in our daily lives. But honestly, we were

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:26.720
planning on staying at home, not doing that
much, not really working that much during

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.929
March and April because we knew we were having
a baby at the end of March and it would be

01:12:31.929 --> 01:12:39.670
a crazy time and we'd want to kind of adjust
to our new family life. So for us it's just

01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:43.340
kind of an extra level. I feel like what you
said, the mental weight is the biggest change.

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.730
Dan:
I think it's gotten weird with neighbors,

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:51.110
too because we have really friendly neighbors
and a couple of them are children and you

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:56.800
want to just play with them and even if you're
thinking about it a lot more. If they're playing

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.560
with the ball, they've touched all over the
ball and you can't play ball with them, for

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.560
example.
Vanessa:

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.611
Or our neighbors want to hold our new baby,
but they can't hold the baby.

01:13:05.611 --> 01:13:06.611
Dan:
Yeah.

01:13:06.611 --> 01:13:07.611
Vanessa:
So in that situation, those are the people

01:13:07.611 --> 01:13:13.670
we see the most often. They can't really interact
with us in the way they did before. So that's

01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:18.500
really, yeah, that's a bummer. But we're all
in this situation at the same time.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.199
Vanessa:
So what about in the future when the main

01:13:22.199 --> 01:13:23.199
parts -
Dan:

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:24.199
Prediction time?
Vanessa:

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:27.719
Yeah, when the main part of the lockdown or
quarantine, all of this has passed.

01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:30.219
Dan:
I'm going to be guaranteed wrong about this.

01:13:30.219 --> 01:13:31.880
Vanessa:
Okay. What's your prediction? What's your

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.630
wrong prediction?
Dan:

01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:35.849
My wrong prediction is, well, what's your
question exactly?

01:13:35.849 --> 01:13:37.770
Vanessa:
Oh, what do you think is going to happen?

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.100
Dan:
What's going to happen, period? Yeah,

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.860
Vanessa:
I don't want to say like, do you think it's

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.880
going to be good or bad? Just what do you
think will happen?

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.920
Dan:
I think the virus is here to stay.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920
Vanessa:
Okay.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.159
Dan:
It's going to probably com back again in the

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:57.761
winter, you know, it might mutate. So we're
just going to have to deal with this. I have

01:13:57.761 --> 01:14:02.670
a hard time believing they'll be able to get
rid of it anytime soon. So it will be more

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:09.421
akin to like the flu, like influenza, or even
the common cold, but just more serious. So

01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:16.380
I don't know. I kind of hope, I'm hoping that
people start living a little more regularly,

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:21.179
but I don't think that's possible. Even if
the government said that they're going to

01:14:21.179 --> 01:14:24.770
stop lock downs, I think it's in people's
heads now.

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:28.550
Vanessa:
I think it will be tough to get out, but I

01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:29.861
have a feeling, at least -
Dan:

01:14:29.861 --> 01:14:30.861
In some people's heads.
Vanessa:

01:14:30.861 --> 01:14:35.980
...In the US, because there's not as many
laws as there are in other countries. I think

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:42.340
that in the US, probably after if the government
said, okay, concerts can go, you can go to,

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.260
can go on, you can go to restaurants again,
you can do anything.

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.599
Dan:
I don't think they'll do big groups for a

01:14:47.599 --> 01:14:48.599
long time.
Vanessa:

01:14:48.599 --> 01:14:53.590
Well, when that happens, I think that people
will be very hesitant for maybe like a month,

01:14:53.590 --> 01:15:00.639
this is my prediction, and then we'll realize,
oh, we're so tired of just keeping to ourselves

01:15:00.639 --> 01:15:02.290
and they'll go out again.
Dan:

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:07.070
Or they might do it for a month and then they'll
start doing it again and then the numbers

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:10.541
will creep up again and then it will start
being reported again and then people will

01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:15.560
start cutting back. I don't know, I think
there'll be kind of like an ebb and flow of

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.770
people going out and doing stuff and then
staying back inside again.

01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:19.770
Vanessa:
I'm curious.

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:21.790
Dan:
But I don't know how much, like especially

01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:28.490
in the US where like so far it seems like
the central government hasn't put down the

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:34.270
lockdown. It's been state by state, and it
just hasn't been quite as intense as some

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:35.750
places it sounds like.
Vanessa:

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:40.429
Yeah. For me, personally, I'm going to be
really curious what happens with the education

01:15:40.429 --> 01:15:47.210
system and what happens with businesses that
aren't used to having all of their employees

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:52.090
work from home when they can go back to work,
if that's going to change how they do things.

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:54.989
Like maybe they'll let people work from home
more often or ...

01:15:54.989 --> 01:15:57.750
Dan:
Maybe some office businesses, office-type

01:15:57.750 --> 01:16:00.790
businesses, will let them work from home more
often anyways.

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:01.790
Vanessa:
Yeah.

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:04.300
Dan:
School is a big question though. I have no

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:09.510
idea. Yeah, that's, cause that's a really
hot spot for germ spread obviously.

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:13.600
Vanessa:
Yeah, and I think that if both of the parents

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:19.170
work, it is extremely difficult right now
for them to manage their work and also help

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:26.390
their kids do homeschooling. It's not traditional
homeschooling but do schooling at home. But

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:30.829
maybe there'll be some flexibility. Who knows?
They might not be so strict with how many

01:16:30.829 --> 01:16:34.469
days you miss at school if they can do stuff
at home. I don't know. It'll be interesting

01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:35.469
to see.
Dan:

01:16:35.469 --> 01:16:39.929
Well I think a lot of places, I think I heard
in Canada, they already canceled public school

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.139
for the rest of the year.
Vanessa:

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:43.429
Like rest of the school year?
Dan:

01:16:43.429 --> 01:16:44.780
No, like this year.
Vanessa:

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:45.780
Like 2020?
Dan:

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:46.780
Yeah.
Vanessa:

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:47.780
Whoa, okay.
Dan:

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.160
Pretty sure, we'll have to look that up.
Vanessa:

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.160
Fact check it.
Dan:

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.340
But I don't know about America. Have you heard
anything about that yet? We don't have kids

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.800
in school yet, so.
Vanessa:

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.830
Yeah. I haven't heard necessarily about, yeah,
being canceled until the end of the year,

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:06.210
but I not necessarily, I wouldn't be surprised
because it seems like that's part of the mental

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:08.850
weight is that there's always an unknown of
what's going to happen.

01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:11.040
Dan:
It also seems like in general the government

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.100
has been more like the things that they do
control, they've been shutting that down more.

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.880
Vanessa:
Oh, like they control the school system -

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.010
Dan:
And the parks, and stuff like that.

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.290
Vanessa:
Parks and stuff, yeah. It seems like every

01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:26.099
country is dealing with it differently and
in the US the main way is letting States kind

01:17:26.099 --> 01:17:31.679
of do their own thing because yeah, New York
is different than North Carolina or California

01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:34.890
or Missouri or wherever you might be. So just
interesting to see.

01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:37.139
Dan:
I like the little experiments too.

01:17:37.139 --> 01:17:38.390
Vanessa:
Every state doing something differently?

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:40.770
Dan:
Yeah, I mean we have that in Europe, too.

01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:43.219
Like apparently Sweden is doing less than
normal.

01:17:43.219 --> 01:17:44.710
Vanessa:
Oh yeah? It's an interesting to see how things

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:45.710
are going.
Dan:

01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:50.440
And right now I think they have a higher case
rate, but like it's, I don't know. I probably

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.909
shouldn't talk about it because I haven't
looked into all the details.

01:17:52.909 --> 01:17:55.440
Vanessa:
Well, that's kind of part of -

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.940
Dan:
That's the whole problem with this thing.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.219
Vanessa:
Yeah. Everyone is their own little expert.

01:17:59.219 --> 01:18:07.650
Right? Well thank you for joining me and talking
about this strange daily situation that we

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:08.650
find ourselves in.
Dan:

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:09.860
You're welcome. I don't know how much I added
but you know, well perspective. Everybody

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.630
gets to see my quarantine beard.
Vanessa:

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:20.010
Yeah. Chit chatting about daily life and yeah,
trying to figure out how to do our new, new

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:24.659
norm. So I hope you appreciated this video.
I hope it was interesting to you. Thank you

01:18:24.659 --> 01:18:29.020
all for spending some of your precious time
learning English with us. And I want to know

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:34.989
in the comments, how has daily life changed
for you in the past month or maybe two months

01:18:34.989 --> 01:18:39.670
if your country has been, was ahead of everyone
and started quarantining earlier.

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:42.000
Vanessa:
What's your daily life look like? Is it different

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.130
than before? Pretty normal? Let us know because
we are all experiencing something pretty similar,

01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:52.040
which is very unusual for the world.
Vanessa:

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.040
Thanks so much.
Dan:

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.040
