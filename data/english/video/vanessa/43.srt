Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.599
Today you're going to learn how to have informal
and formal conversations in English on the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.599
phone.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.620
Let's get started.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.450
Vanessa: Let's start with informal conversations
on the phone in English.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.330
These are when you call a friend or maybe
a family member in English and you're just

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.710
chatting about getting together, or you just
want to talk.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.980
This is something that is a little bit less
common nowadays, because you're more likely

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.429
to send a text message to a friend or family
member, and we don't use home landlines as

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:40.429
often.

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.499
You're more likely to use your cell phone.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.350
You're not really going to leave a voicemail,
you're probably going to send a text instead.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.449
So if you have learned phone conversations
at school a long time ago, it might be a little

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.550
bit simpler now, because there's not as many
options.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.859
Vanessa: [00:00:30] Let's take a look at two
conversations that are informal on the phone,

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.470
and you'll see how straightforward and simple
these can be.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.870
Vanessa: [00:01:00] Hi, is this Daniel?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.360
Daniel: Yes, it is.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.950
Vanessa: Hi, is this Daniel?

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.230
Daniel: Yes, it is.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.820
Vanessa: Hi, is this Benjamin?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.720
Daniel: No, sorry, you have the wrong number.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.770
Vanessa: Oh, sorry.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.770
Thanks.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.770
Daniel: No problem.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.920
Vanessa: Hi, is this Benjamin?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.950
Daniel: No, sorry, you have the wrong number.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.110
Vanessa: Oh, sorry.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.110
Thanks.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.110
Daniel: No problem.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.110
Vanessa: That wasn't too bad, right?

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.370
Pretty simple and straight forward.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.450
Well, if you're going to talk on the phone
in a formal situation—let's say for your

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.910
job you need to call another department, or
you need to talk with some customers—this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.660
is going to be a little more serious because
you want to be polite, you don't want to be

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.210
rude, and you want to make sure that they
can understand exactly what you're saying.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.120
So let's take a little bit more time to talk
about formal English conversations.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.930
Vanessa: [00:01:30] Let's start with a basic
beginning to a conversation that you might

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.090
have at your workplace in English.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.140
Vanessa: Hi, may I please speak with Daniel?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.140
Daniel: Speaking.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.300
How can I help you?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.220
Vanessa: Hi, may I please speak with Daniel?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.250
Daniel: [00:02:00] Speaking.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.520
How can I help you?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.450
Vanessa: This one was pretty clear, right?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.640
You call someone, the person picks up the
phone and they want to talk.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.129
They have time to talk.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.249
But what if you call a secretary and you want
to talk with the marketing department?

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:21.439
Well, maybe they're available, maybe they're
not, maybe the person wants to ask you some

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.241
questions to see if the marketing department
actually wants to talk to you.

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.709
It could get a little more complicated.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.660
So let's talk about three different scenarios.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.420
Let's imagine that you're calling to marketing
department and the person who picks up the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.780
phone answers affirmatively, then they answer
with some kind of filter question, and then

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.560
they answer negatively.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.859
What do those three different conversations
look like?

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:47.859
Let's listen.

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.569
Daniel: [00:02:30] Hi, this is Daniel from
Microsoft.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.840
May I please speak with someone from the marketing
department?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.609
Vanessa: Yes, just one moment.

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.139
Daniel: Hi, this is Daniel from Microsoft.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.540
May I please speak with someone from the marketing
department?

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.430
Vanessa: May I ask what you're calling about?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.900
Daniel: Hi, this is Daniel from Microsoft.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.950
May I please speak with someone in the marketing
department?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.840
Vanessa: [00:03:00] I'm sorry, the manager
of the marketing department is in a meeting

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.989
right now.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.230
Would you like to leave a message?

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.109
Daniel: No, thanks.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.240
When would be a good time to call back?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.529
Vanessa: Maybe in about an hour.

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.000
Daniel: Okay, I'll do that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.240
Vanessa: So far you've heard a lot of questions
that use, "May I ..." or, "Would you ..." These

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.819
are really polite words in English, and if
you incorporate these in your conversations

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.849
you're going to take your politeness and formalness
to the next level.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.659
So even if you don't use these exact sentences,
if you use, "May I ...", "Would you ...," "Would

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.669
you mind ...", these are going to make your
sentences more polite.

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.611
Vanessa: [00:03:30] In our final scenario,
let's image that you call someone, they're

00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:50.370
not available so you leave a message and ask
if they can call you back later.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.640
What does that conversation look like, especially
the beginning because you're introducing who

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.989
you are, why you're calling.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.010
Let's take a look at it.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.109
Vanessa: Hi, this is Vanessa from the marketing
department at Apple, I'm returning your call

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.319
from earlier today.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.269
Daniel: Thanks for calling me back.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.980
I wanted to ask you if you'd like to join
me and take over the galaxy.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980
Thank you.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.450
Vanessa: [00:04:00] Okay, okay, so maybe if
you have a business conversation you're not

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.540
going to be talking about taking over the
galaxy together, but, the beginning of the

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.000
sentence is going to be same: "Thanks for
calling me back."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.930
Thanks for calling me back, it's just straightforward,
and clear, and simple.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.220
I hope that this will be easy for you to remember,
and if it's not you can always write some

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.330
notes and leave them at your desk so that
you can remember this expression.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.530
Vanessa: [00:04:30] All right, now it's your
turn.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.580
I want to know in the comments below this
video, do you need to use English for your

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.580
job?

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.009
Have you ever spoken English on the phone
before?

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.810
I hope that this video will be useful to you,
and you can use these expressions when you're

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.169
talking in informal or formal situations.

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.410
Thanks so much, and I'll see you the next
time.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.410
Bye.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.409
