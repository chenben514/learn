Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from the website,
SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.769
Welcome to the sample conversation video lesson
from the course The Fearless Fluency Club.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.570
In this video, you'll see myself and my sister
Cherise having a conversation, a natural,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.960
real conversation about reverse culture shock.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.050
If you don't know what this term is, watch
the video.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.010
If you'd like to hear natural conversations,
I'm sure you'll enjoy it, and to analyze and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.560
learn about the vocabulary, the grammar, the
pronunciation that we use in this video, make

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.559
sure that you watch the other videos in this
series.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.110
That way you can more completely and fully
understand the conversation and use the English

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.120
yourself.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.679

up here at the top, the little I in the corner.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.339
Thanks so much and let's get started.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.460
Hi everyone.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.800
I want to introduce you to my sister, Charisse.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.280
Charisse: Hi everyone.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.970
Vanessa: Today we're going to talk about a
cool topic, reverse culture shock, but first

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.120
I want to introduce my sister, because you
probably don't know her.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.930
Can you tell us first a little bit about where
you've lived or different countries you've

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.930
lived in?

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.930
Cherise: Yeah, sure.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.930
Well, I lived in France.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.970
I lived in Argentina, and I recently returned
from South Korea.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.340
Vanessa: Cool, cool.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.180
What were you doing in France?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.340
Cherise: In France, I was an au pair.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.100
In Argentina, I had multiple jobs actually.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.250
First, I worked at a volunteer organization,
then I taught English, every odd job.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.190
Then, I moved directly to South Korea, where
I also taught English.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.000
Vanessa: Yeah, so you're also an English teacher
or yo used to be an English teacher.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That's really cool.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.290
We have something in common.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.290
Cherise: Yeah.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.290
Yeah, we do.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.250
Vanessa: The topic for today is reverse culture
shock, and maybe some people know about what

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.049
culture shock is, but how would you describe
culture shock?

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.819
Cherise: Reverse culture shock is when you
go from the country you've been living in,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.670
a foreign country, let's say, South Korea,
you come back to your home country, and then

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.459
all of a sudden everything feels foreign,
as if you're returning to a foreign country

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.499
and not your home country.

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.870
You don't connect with people.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.390
You feel very different from everything around
you.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.689
Vanessa: Yeah, you feel kind of disconnected
from what used to be really normal for you.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.689
Cherise: Exactly.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.299
Vanessa: Yeah, and that's a terrible feeling
because you feel like, "Oh, I should be going

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.299
home.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.469
I should be really comfortable," and then
you feel really weird.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.829
Cherise: Exactly.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:48.849
You don't expect it.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.330
You hear of culture shock, but reverse culture
shock is something you're not expecting.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.359
Because you don't prepare for it, it hits
you harder.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.950
Vanessa: Yeah, that's a good point.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.410
I don't know.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.529
Have you ever felt culture shock, regular
culture shock when you moved to Argentina

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:04.860
or France or Korea?

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.170
Did you feel like, "This is a new culture"?

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.460
Cherise: I definitely did to an extent, because
you're preparing for it.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.170
You know you're going to another country.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.019
You're going to feel discomfort of some sort,
and you're expecting to feel it, so I think

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.269
you prepare more for this culture shock, but
reverse culture shock, you're not ready, you're

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.450
not prepared, and it just hits you.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.999
Vanessa: Yeah, especially when you go to another
country and you know you're going to live

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.430
there for a while, you probably do a lot of
preparation.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.810
I know when we moved to Korea, I was watching
videos all the time about Korea and what's

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.669
life like, some of the language, some culture
different stuff, but when we came back to

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.040
the US, I didn't think about that at all.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.720
It's just like, "Oh, it's just the US.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.680
It's my home country."

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.150
Cherise: Exactly, right.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.170
It's definitely real.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.230
It's definitely there and it's something that
you don't think about.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.760
Vanessa: Yeah, especially when you've been
living away for a while.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.069
How long were you living away from the US
before you came back?

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.329
Cherise: Four years.

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.329
Vanessa: So Argentina, and then-
Cherise: First Argentina for a year, then

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.870
South Korea for three years.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.870
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.870
That's a long time.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.870
Cherise: It had been a long time.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.819
I hadn't made any trips, just to visit friends
or family.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:21.699
My friends weren't even American, I would
say, so I wasn't even getting some culture

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:22.870
from my American friends.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.259
Vanessa: Yeah, you're culturally disconnected.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.720
Cherise: Most of my friends were foreign or
from the country I was living in.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.690
Vanessa: Yeah, so when you lived in Argentina
and Korea, you didn't really have American

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.990
friends so much.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.990
Maybe some.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.360
Cherise: There were a few, but they weren't
the majority, or I wasn't even looking to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.729
make those connections with American people.

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.291
Vanessa: Yeah, you wanted to make friends
that are from the country.

00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.699
Cherise: I wanted to, yeah, acclimate to the
country and to the culture.

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.699
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.270
I think a lot of people, at least a lot of
my students, if they're living in an English-speaking

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.819
country, that's a huge question, "How can
I meet people who are from the local culture?"

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.100
But you did it.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.669
What do you think helped you?

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.730
That's kind of off topic, but what do you
think helped you to make friends with people

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.930
who weren't American?

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.340
Was it your jobs or you just learned the language?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.289
Cherise: I think what helped was going to
events that weren't for foreigners.

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.490
I went to those types of things where you
know you're going to meet locals who live

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.559
there, and then just connecting with them
and then a lot of times, they're very receptive.

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:30.360
They want to be your friend, too, and then
that brings you into their friend group.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.360
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.120
You mean dances or concerts, or what kind
of events did you go to?

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.039
Cherise: Yeah, concerts, a lot of concerts
in Argentina mainly, and then in South Korea,

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.009
I would say it was with my work because I
was the only foreigner at the school I worked

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.759
at.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.180
Everyone I worked with was a local, was Korean,
and that's how I connected with them.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.909
Vanessa: Yeah, so if you wanted to learn more
about the culture, they were already around

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:58.909
you.

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:59.909
That's really cool.

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:06.789
I think it takes a lot of guts, though, because
when you are the only person who's American

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.680
or from your country in an area, maybe you
would be more likely to seclude yourself or

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.259
be like, "I feel really uncomfortable talking
to them.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:16.259
Do they want to talk to me?"

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.260
Cherise: Yeah, but they were very nice.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.820
I never felt that awkward situation where
maybe they don't want me here.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.360
I felt very welcomed, and this is in South
Korea.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.599
Vanessa: In Argentina, was it different?

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.980
Cherise: No, it wasn't different.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.840
This is coming from the experience of working
in South Korea.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.210
In Argentina, as well, but definitely in South
Korea because I was the only foreign teacher,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.599
but luckily I was with my husband, Toddo.

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.560
Vanessa: Yeah, so can you tell us a little
bit about Toddo because Cherise's husband

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.139
also plays an important role in I think this
culture shock or acclimating to a new culture,

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.590
so can you tell us about him?

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.030
His name's Toddo, so if you hear Toddo, it's
not an English word you don't know.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.030
It's just his name.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.030
Cherise: Sure.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.389
He's Colombian and we met in Argentina.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.879
We got married in Argentina and then together
we moved to South Korea, so he's been with

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:15.010
me through basically-
Vanessa: A lot of changes.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.349
Cherise: ... everywhere, in Argentina, in
Korea, and then back to the US right now.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:24.949
I think he's really helped me acclimate better
just because I have somebody who's been with

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:31.270
me through all these experiences, and if no
one else connects with me, I know he will

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.000
and I know he'll understand what I've been
through because he's been through it, too,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.540
and we can kind of hash it out together.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.540
That has helped a lot.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.710
Vanessa: I think that makes a big difference
too because I know when I've traveled alone

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.889
somewhere and then I came back to the US,
no one understood what I'd seen or the cool

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:49.169
experiences, so I felt really lonely.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.740
There's no one I can talk to about this, and
if I said, "Oh, I went here and I went there

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.540
and this was really cool, and oh, in Germany,
it's like this," they'd just be like, "Oh,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.540
that's really cool."

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.000
Maybe they thought it was cool, but they just
can't get it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Cherise: Right.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Exactly.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.300
Either I feel like I'm talking too much about
Korea and they're like, "Oh shut up, please

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.300
stop."

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.300
Vanessa: That's hard because it's part of
your past.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.720
Cherise: I want someone to tell.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:16.060
Yeah, I want someone to be able to appreciate
or just even listen.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.620
You've been somewhere and you want to be able
to share what you've seen, what you've learned.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.620
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.620
We're like grandmas.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.620
We want to just tell our stories.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.620
Cherise: Exactly.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:30.650
It's really helped having Toddo around and
being able to connect with him stronger just

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.860
because we've been everywhere together.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.240
Vanessa: Yeah, you guys have a closer bond
because you've been through a lot.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.740
Cherise: Right, right.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.919
Vanessa: I think there's something ... Oh,
what was I going to say?

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:42.829
There's something cool about, oh, you guys'
relationship that we haven't mentioned yet,

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:47.370
that part of that reverse culture shock that
we'll talk about in just a second is a language

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.870
thing, going from not being in an English
speaking country to being in the US, where

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.389
there's English everywhere.

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:59.790
You speak Spanish, so can you tell us a little
bit about your language experience with him?

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.750
I think this is so cool.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.300
Cherise: Okay, sure.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:12.209
Well, before I was going to Argentina because
I wanted to learn Spanish, and I met Toddo.

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:15.950
Well, when we met, we didn't speak Spanish
immediately together.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.060
We spoke English.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:23.450
He also speaks perfect English, but then as
time grew on I was getting more like, "I really

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.899
want to learn Spanish, and let's speak Spanish
together," which is actually really hard,

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:32.430
especially with a couple, with a pair to be
like, "Okay, we're going to speak only"-

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.709
Vanessa: And change languages in the middle
of your relationship.

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:39.780
Cherise: Exactly, yeah, but we somehow managed
to do that somewhat successfully I would say.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.690
I would speak Spanish almost I would say 90%
of the time.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.950
Vanessa: That's awesome.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.950
Cherise: Which is really good.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.940
It's helped me a lot.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.570
It's helped our relationship.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.890
I don't know why.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.890
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:59.470
That's part of his native language though,
so maybe for him too, he can connect better.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.470
Cherise: I agree.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.230
I think it has to do something with that.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.880
All around, it's been great, so yeah.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:12.089
Vanessa: That's cool that you have that connection,
but coming back to the US, if you didn't want

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:14.620
to speak English, you could speak Spanish
together.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.620
Cherise: Right.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.620
Oh yeah, I didn't mention that.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.940
When we came back to the US, I felt like everyone
was listening to my conversations and it was

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.940
just uncomfortable.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.709
I didn't want to speak out loud because I
thought, "Everyone's listening to me."

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.060
Vanessa: Yeah, that's a really weird feeling.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.470
Cherise: We would speak in Spanish everywhere,
but then again also, there's a lot of people

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.600
who speak Spanish, so it doesn't work all
the time.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.640
Vanessa: Kind of an illusion.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.240
Cherise: You feel like you're speaking a secret
language.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.940
I feel like that's a good segue to the next
thing of when have you experienced reverse

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.240
culture shock?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.490
Coming back from the Argentina Korea experience
to the US, did you experience any of that?

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.490
Cherise: Definitely.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:11:02.070
I felt a longing for the Argentinian lifestyle
I had when I was in Korea for at least a few

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.380
months, like, "Oh, we can just go out to all
these restaurants and they have a lot more

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.910
varieties of food," so that was hard.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.829
Maybe public transportation, although Korea
also has fantastic public transportation.

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:17.440
It just stops at a certain time so you have
to know what your-

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.670
Vanessa: Oh, Argentinian transportation went
longer?

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.350
Cherise: It's all night, all day, 24/7.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.350
Vanessa: Whoa.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.000
Cherise: You don't have to think, "Okay, I've
got to go home now."

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.640
Cherise: There were some things that I missed
about Argentinian life that-

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.480
Vanessa: Weren't in Korea.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.180
Cherise: Yeah, that didn't exist in Korea,
and also, at least in Argentina, I understood

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.060
what people were saying and I could communicate.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.680
Even though it wasn't my first language, at
least I could communicate with people.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.620
Vanessa: That makes a huge difference, though,
connecting with the culture, if you can understand

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.620
the language.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.620
Cherise: I know.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.810
It opened a lot of doors.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.810
When I went to Korea, I felt very closed.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.260
I couldn't communicate with anyone.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.709
I didn't really know what was going on.

00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:01.300
There was a lot of cultural differences, too.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.079
Eventually, you adapt to any circumstance.

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:10.139
I was able to adapt to living in Korea, and
then-

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:13.760
Vanessa: You probably learned some of the
language, enough to read or enough to minimally

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760
communicate.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.540
Cherise: Right, I could read, and also, yes,
communicate with the students, communicate

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.570
with my coworkers.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.279
Sometimes some of them spoke English.

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:30.410
Anyway, when I went from Korea to the US,
there was another level of culture shock just

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:36.650
because America was my home country and then
all of a sudden, I felt like a foreigner in

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.650
my own country.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.650
Vanessa: That's a really weird feeling.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.000
Cherise: I still feel that way to an extent,
not as strongly as when I first arrived.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.899
Vanessa: Yeah, and how long have you been
back now?

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:45.899
Sorry to interrupt you.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:49.220
Cherise: I think it's been four months.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.540
Vanessa: Four months.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.860
That's not long.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.010
Cherise: I came in March 1st of 2016.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.970
Vanessa: Yeah, March, April, May, June, yeah,
about four months.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:59.970
It's still fresh.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.510
Cherise: Yeah, it's still fresh, but it was
definitely hard the first month.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.510
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.510
What did you experience?

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.009
Tell us about that first month, if you don't
mind rehashing those deep days.

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:10.009
Cherise: Sure.

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:12.310
I'm trying to think of some very good examples.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:19.650
Well, when I first arrived, I arrived in Jackson
Hartfield Airport, which is in Atlanta, which

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.410
is one of the biggest airports.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:28.269
I just remember arriving there, and all of
a sudden hearing everyone speaking English

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:34.500
and just the interactions between the workers
in the airport and the interactions with them

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.990
with me and Toddo, and it just felt so strange.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.569
I don't know how to explain it.

00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:43.700
That's the thing about reverse culture shock.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.210
Vanessa: Yeah, it's just a strange feeling.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.899
Cherise: You can't explain it unless you've
experienced it, and maybe you can prepare

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:57.930
for it, but some other examples, I remember
going to get a cell phone in the US.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.940
I wasn't prepared for so much social interaction.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.819
Vanessa: In English, or just-
Cherise: In English.

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:07.089
I think that's what it was.

00:14:07.089 --> 00:14:10.890
There's so many people and I kept feeling
like people were listening to me or watching

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:16.060
me strangely because in Korea, people would
look at me at least, at least notice, "There's

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.060
a foreigner."

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.060
Vanessa: Because you're not Korean.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.720
Cherise: Right, and so I guess I assumed that
people were still doing that, although now

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:30.920
I'm not standing out as a foreigner, but I
still felt like these eyes were watching me.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.740
It just was a strange moment of life.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.740
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.769
You realize you do look like other people
here.

00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:37.769
Cherise: Right.

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:40.399
I realized I'm not actually standing out like
I was in Korea.

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:41.959
Vanessa: You're not special anymore.

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:42.959
Cherise: Not special.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:43.959
That's okay.

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:47.370
Vanessa: Even though that's something negative,
I think reverse culture shock in general is

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:54.279
something negative, for me, it's nit-picking
small things about American culture because

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:58.630
that's our home culture that I didn't nit-pick
about before.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.740
A big thing that got me, I don't know why
this was a big deal, but for some reason when

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:08.720
I came back from France, living in France
for a year, for some reason it really bothered

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.660
me that people mowed their lawns.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.740
When I saw people mowing their lawns, it's
such a waste.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.220
Why don't you just grow something else or
why don't we have something else here?

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.579
Why are you mowing a lawn, or why are you
using 100 grocery bags?

00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:22.940
Just bring your own bag.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.139
Don't use these plastic bags.

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:25.399
Cherise: That's something I don't understand,
either.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.399
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:31.600
It's just such a small thing that shouldn't
bother me and I feel like I'm generally easygoing

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.540
or little things don't bother me like that,
but I think it was reverse culture shock,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:42.279
that comparing it to good things from the
culture that I came from and being like, "Why

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:43.660
is my culture like this?

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.579
Ugh," so pissed off about it.

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:51.149
Cherise: Right, and you realize, well, they
don't know that maybe it's better to bring

00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:52.839
your own bag, bring a little cart.

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:55.889
It just isn't part of the American culture
at this point.

00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:56.889
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:01.860
Cherise: Another thing about grocery stores
is there are so many options.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.470
I realized, "This is why we have a problem
with obesity maybe."

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.330
It could be the fact that you have 100 different
types of cereal to choose from, or I don't

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.600
know how many types of cereal there are.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600
Vanessa: Hundreds.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.089
Cherise: Too many.

00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:19.089
I want to buy milk.

00:16:19.089 --> 00:16:25.129
Why do I have to choose from 20 different
types of milk?

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:27.860
Why are there so many options?

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.449
There shouldn't ... I don't know.

00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:31.440
Vanessa: It's overwhelming.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.209
Today we went to the store to look at coconut
oil, and it's a small grocery store and there's

00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:39.980
what, like 30 choices, 20 choices?

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.290
Cherise: Americans have a lot of options.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.600
A lot of countries don't have that many options
to choose from.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.600
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.510
In a way, it's neither here nor there, but
it's one of those things that when you come

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.110
back to your own culture and see that, you
can feel overwhelmed.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:02.129
I think that's a sign of reverse culture shock
is being overwhelmed by something you thought

00:17:02.129 --> 00:17:05.980
would be normal, like going to the grocery
store, something really normal.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:11.429
Cherise: Something you do all the time, and
all of a sudden, it's something that is a

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:12.429
small struggle.

00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:13.429
Vanessa: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:15.179
Cherise: Choosing what you want to eat.

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:16.659
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:20.180
Do you think that reverse culture shock is
avoidable?

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:25.000
Is it possible to make it any better than
it is?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
This could apply to culture shock, too, but
like we already said, I think we kind of prepare

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.480
for culture shock.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.990
When you go to a foreign country, you prepare
more, so reverse culture shock-

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.789
Cherise: Right, you're saying, "I don't need
to prepare.

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:39.190
I'm going back to my home country."

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.440
I think there are certain things you can do
to prepare for it.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.299
I don't think you can completely avoid it,
but at least know that these things are going

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:53.360
to be issues for me, so what can I do to ease
the difficulty?

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.809
For example, public transportation in Korea
is fantastic.

00:17:58.809 --> 00:17:59.809
I never drove a car.

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:01.291
I biked, I took the bus or I took the subway.

00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:07.200
I thought for me, it's going to be very important
to live somewhere and be able to either walk,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.059
bike, or drive a car minimally.

00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:10.059
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:11.059
Oh, that sounds a lot like me.

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:14.350
Cherise: Buying a car, you have to get a car
if you're in the US.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.350
It's unavoidable.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.360
Vanessa: Unless you live downtown New York,
but that's not going to be many people.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.520
Cherise: Right.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.500
Vanessa: Unless you're a millionaire.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:29.150
Cherise: I need to realize that this is going
to be a problem for me and prepare for it

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.600
as best I can, although I'm still going to
have to drive, I'm still going to have to

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.320
face this difficulty, you could say.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.510
You're still going to have to do something
you don't want to do.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:45.690
Cherise: Right, that I'm not comfortable or
used to doing, but it is the only way.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.850
I guess you can prepare for it, but you can't
avoid it.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:49.850
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.490
I think for me coming back to the US, I had
a lot of fears.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:58.620
I don't think if they were irrational or not,
but I knew that I had a great time living

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.300
abroad and in France and in Europe and in
Korea.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.340
It was so fun and really enjoyable.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.550
Every day there's something different and
new, and then coming back to the US, a big

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.690
thing was, is every day just going to be a
daily routine?

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.470
Am I just going to feel like there's not new
surprises around every corner?

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.130
When you're abroad, even if you're just traveling
or visiting, you find a new market around

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.830
the corner or there's someone playing street
music or just fun little things.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.919
Cherise: There's always something new, right.

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:29.850
Vanessa: Yeah, so that was a big deal for
us is finding somewhere where there is new

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:37.750
stuff going on or there's maybe some diversity
or some new cultures or something more than

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:44.850
just a boxed lifestyle where you have franchises
and suburban lifestyle.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.270
You've got some city life.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.270
Cherise: Right.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.500
I think that would be very difficult to go
from living in Korea to going and living in

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.660
suburbia, where you have to drive 20 minutes
just to go to the supermarket and there's

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.670
nothing really going on around where you're
living.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.970
That would be really hard.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:02.970
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.280
I think that's something that was a priority
for us, it seems like for you guys, too-

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280
Cherise: Right, definitely.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280
Vanessa: Live close to the city.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.280
Cherise: Yes.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.779
I think I realized I like living in bigger
cities and it's going to be really difficult

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:18.150
to go and live in the countryside or live
in a little neighborhood way far away from

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.150
everything.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.150
Vanessa: Yeah.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.730
Maybe that's something that could happen in
the future.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.220
I don't know.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:30.710
I would like to have a garden or like to live
... It's maybe more idealistic, but at the

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.450
moment, it's not really something that I want,
so maybe in the future, but I think that's

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.309
an important point, knowing what you want.

00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:37.309
Cherise: Right.

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:38.500
Everyone wants something different.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.429
They have their own ... What's important to
you is different than what's important to

00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:46.590
me, than somebody else, to know what you want.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:52.559
Vanessa: And taking some time to analyze that,
like, "Oh, what do I like about living where

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.559
I'm living now?"

00:20:53.559 --> 00:21:00.580
In Korea, you really liked transportation,
so how can I make that happen in my home country?

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.100
For me, I liked having little surprises around
every corner.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.049
It's not going to be exactly the same.

00:21:05.049 --> 00:21:10.480
It's not a foreign country, but how can I
make that happen somehow or find the right

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.480
place?

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480
Cherise: Yeah.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.450
Vanessa: At least for Americans, I don't know,
maybe it's different for other countries,

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.690
but for us, it's not a big deal if you don't
go back and live in your hometown.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.860
Cherise: Yeah.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.370
You can go [crosstalk 00:21:22].

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.370
Exactly.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:29.270
Vanessa: I know some people, at least some
people I've talked to who aren't American,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:34.360
they're really surprised that maybe you've
lived in California, like Dan, who's my husband.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.050
Maybe some of you have met him.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:40.620
Dan lived in California, then Colorado, then
Pennsylvania, then he went to school in Tennessee.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:45.120
That's all over the US, east, west, middle,
south, everywhere, and it's totally normal.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.630
Most people have lived in several places.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:55.120
Even for us, we lived in the north and then
the south and we have roots in both places.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.960
Cherise: Yeah, so I feel like it's hard to
come back and feel super connected immediately.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.039
That's not going to happen.

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:02.120
Vanessa: Yeah, but that's okay.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.789
I think knowing about it, that's probably
the biggest thing to avoid it is being knowledgeable

00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:14.130
that you might feel shocked about it and how
to avoid that, or just have more patience

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.130
with yourself.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.130
Cherise: Yeah.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.130
You know it's going to get better.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.770
You'll feel more connected and integrated
as time goes on.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.289
Vanessa: Yeah, or be more patient with your
partner.

00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:29.400
If I was upset at Dan about something, I'd
be like, "Wait, this is probably just because

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.750
I'm adjusting.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:36.750
I shouldn't get frustrated or snippy about
little things because I'm adjusting, so sorry

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.330
to put this on you."

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.470
Cherise: At least you realize it.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.250
Vanessa: Yeah, and you're not perfect, but
I think that's something that just being aware

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.890
of it is a big deal.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.040
Thanks so much for talking about reverse culture
shock.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040
Cherise: Yeah.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040
No problem.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.090
Vanessa: Thanks everyone for watching this
conversation with Cherise, my sister.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.110
If you'd like to see any more conversations
with her in the future, let us know.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.110
Bye.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.110
Cherise: Bye.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:04.710
Vanessa: Thanks so much for watching this
sample conversation lesson for The Fearless

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.120
Fluency Club.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:11.260
I hope you learned something new and if we
were speaking too quickly, if there's some

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:16.409
grammar you would like to learn about, some
vocabulary or pronunciation you want to improve

00:23:16.409 --> 00:23:22.980
for yourself so that you can use it, I recommend
watching the other videos in this series,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.260
the sample videos for the course, The Fearless
Fluency Club.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.730
