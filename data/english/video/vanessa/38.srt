Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.799
Do you wanna watch English TV shows without
subtitles?

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.260
Let's talk about it.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.450
If you want to enjoy watching English TV shows
or movies without subtitles, you're in the

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.270
right place, but first, we need to address
your mindset.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.420
To watch the Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones,
or even Friends without subtitles, you need

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.220
to know, you will not understand every single
word.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.520
Especially if right now it's really challenging
for you to understand anything in an English

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.210
TV show, your goal is not to understand every
word.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.770
Your goal is to enjoy watching the show and
to understand the context and the general

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.270
ideas without subtitles.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.180
So in your mind, you need to let go of any
frustration, "I can't understand that phrase!",

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.710
"Oh I missed that expression."

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.819
Don't worry about it, let it go, the main
purpose here, especially starting off is to

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.020
understand the context.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.819
Before we start with my method, my one tip
for subtitle success, let's find a short three

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:24.850
to five minute YouTube video or TED Talk that
is a good maybe too fast, not too slow video.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.969
Let's imagine you can already understand 10
words.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.369
Okay, it's a good start, I wanna make sure
you don't start with a video where someone

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.539
is talking like, it's just so fast in your
ears that it is unbelievable.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.569
Let's start with something a little bit simpler
and use this method and then you can work

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:42.639
your way up.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:43.740
What's the method?

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.740
Let's talk about it.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:53.670
My number one tip for subtitle success is
to first watch the video without subtitles.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.279
Here you're testing your ears, what can you
understand?

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.159
What don't you understand?

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.930
Second, watch it again with subtitles in English.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.640
Here you can see each word, you can catch
each word, even if you need to pause it.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.360
Great, you are seeing each word and you're
hearing it at the same time.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.400
And then the final part, is to watch it again
without subtitles.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.010
Did you hear more than the first time?

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.829
Probably because now that you've seen those
words in the English subtitles, you're gonna

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:32.489
be able to pick them up audibly when you are
listening without subtitles.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.689
This one tip of actually using subtitles to
help you slowly get away from using subtitles

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.180
is an excellent method and it's something
that I've used a lot as I've been learning

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.180
French.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.620
So let's see how you can use this in the real
world with a TED Talk.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.400
Let's go over to the TED Talk website.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.920
Here you'll find a lot of great speeches about
interesting topics.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.599
Most of them are about 15 minutes, but I see
one here that is only five minutes and 41

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.599
seconds, great.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.290
Let's click on that.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.480
You can listen to the speaker, but the cool
thing about TED Talks is that you can click

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.100
on the transcript.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.530
You can choose different languages, if you
would like, but I recommend starting with

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.530
English.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.810
You're learning English, so test your English
skills, and you can click on any sentence

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.180
and it will take you to that exact place in
the speech that used that sentence.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.450
So if you want to test your ears again and
again, listen to that sentence, read the sentence,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.140
use the subtitles, don't use the subtitles,
use this method with TED Talks.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.769
Be consistent and practice understanding fast
English every day.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.730
I recommend taking this technique and challenging
yourself for three days.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.840
One day one, choose a short video clip, three
to five minutes and use those three different

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
steps.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.139
Use it without subtitles, with subtitles,
then without subtitles.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.090
And on day two, go and listen to a new clip
and use those three steps, but when you're

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.090
finished, you back and watch the day one clip
without subtitles.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.970
You'll be surprised that you can actually
understand more and more each time that you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.610
listen, and then one day three, chose a new
clip, use those three steps without subtitles,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.180
with subtitles, without subtitles, and then
guess what?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.510
You're gonna go back, go back to the day two
clip, go back to the day one clip, and watch

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.290
those without subtitles.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.320
You can repeat this for as many days as you'd
like, but I think three days is a good starting

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.030
point, it's a good challenge, you can do it.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.450
If you're studying a five minute video, it
should only take you 15 minutes the first

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.400
day, 20 minutes the second day, and 25 minutes
the third day.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.020
That's not too bad, especially if you are
focusing and really improving your listening

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.830
skills, of course you can always join the
30 day English listening challenge and challenge

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.411
yourself for 30 days, you can join up here
or learn more information about it, but you

00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:06.760
can also use this technique yourself when
you are proactive and taking action to improve

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.110
your skills.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.110
And now I have a question for you, in the
comments below this video, let me know, do

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.260

subtitles?
