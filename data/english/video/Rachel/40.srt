00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.749
This American English pronunciation video
comes to you from Keukenhof in the Netherlands.

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:13.749
As we look at the beautiful tulips in Keukenhof
Gardens, we'll study some colors.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.310
&gt;&gt; Sara, it's so fun visiting the Netherlands
with you.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.820
&gt;&gt; I know! It's great.
&gt;&gt; Now, I thought in this video, since we're

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.490
at the flower garden, we can talk about the
colors. And I'll go over the pronunciation.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:41.180
What are you seeing here in this bed?
&gt;&gt; So, here there is red, and white, and yellow,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.930
and, it's hard to see, but there's a little
bit of purple.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.510
&gt;&gt; And a little bit of purple too.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:57.390
Red, white, yellow, purple. Colors are adjectives,
which are content words. Nouns, verbs, adjectives,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.250
and adverbs are content words. This generally
means they should be stressed, or, longer

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.699
in a sentence.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:13.030
So, we want to say 'red', not 'red'. The red
one. Red, which is the only stressed word

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:21.049
in this sentence, should be noticeably longer
than 'the' and 'one'. The red one. The red

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:29.469
one. 'Red' has the R consonant, the EH as
in BED vowel, and the D sound. Red. R is a

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.159
difficult sound. You should be able to hold
it out. Rrrrrr. If it's at the beginning of

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.210
a word, the lips will really round a lot.
Let's take a look at Sara saying this word.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.450
&gt;&gt; Red. [3x]

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.350
Even though Sara is in profile, you can still
tell how much her lips are rounding for that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.479
beginning R. Rr.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.499
&gt;&gt; Red. [3x] And white.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:03.219
White. This is also a one-syllable adjective.
So, just like 'red', it should stand out in

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:10.610
a sentence, being longer than the unstressed
words. It begins with the W consonant. Just

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.670
like the beginning R, the lips come into a
tight circle for that. Next is the AI as in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.360
BUY diphthong. You'll need to drop your jaw
some for this sound. 'White' ends with a T.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.740
Sara chose to make that a True T sound. White.
You'll also hear many native speakers make

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.300
it a Stop T. 'White' instead of 'white'. Let's
listen to Sara say it again.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.410
&gt;&gt; And white [3x], and yellow. And, it's hard
to see, but there's a little bit of purple.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.890
Yellow, purple. These are two-syllable words.
There is one stressed, and one unstressed

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:01.540
syllable each: yellow, purple. Can you tell,
which syllable is stressed? Yellow, yell-ow.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:12.320
Purple, pur-ple. They both have stress on
the first syllable. DA-da, yellow, purple.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.740
What does is mean when a stressed word, a
content word, has an unstressed syllable?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.090
Well, even though it's a stressed word, the
unstressed syllables should still be very

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.120
short: -ow, -ow, yellow. -ple, -ple, purple.
Listen for how the first syllable in these

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.060
words is longer than the second syllable.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.560
&gt;&gt; And yellow. [3x] And, it's hard to see
but there's a little bit of purple. [3x]

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.260
Yellow, purple.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.560
&gt;&gt; A little bit of purple, too. Here we have
a gardener.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.390
&gt;&gt; ... These are for you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you!

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.580
&gt;&gt; Oh wow. That's so nice!
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You got a good picture?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you!
&gt;&gt; The Netherlands just got better.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.450
&gt;&gt; Yellow and orange.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.170
Orange. Another two-syllable word with stress
on the first syllable. Orange. [3x]

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.959
&gt;&gt; So here in this bed, there's some pink.
Also some peach.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:27.870
Pink, peach. Each one syllable. Pink has the
P consonant, the IH vowel, the NG consonant,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.520
and the K. You may ask: why is there an NG
consonant when there's no letter G in the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:43.569
word? The letter N makes an NG sound when
the next sound is a K. Kk. Other examples:

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:55.560
thanks, thanks, with the NG sound. Drink,
drink. With the NG sound.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:04.550
&gt;&gt; So here, in this bed, there's some pink. 
Also some peach.  Magenta.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:13.169
Magenta. Here's a three-syllable word. What
is the one stressed syllable? Can you tell?

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.360
&gt;&gt; Magenta [3x]

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.820
Magenta, da-DA-da. It's the middle syllable.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.800
&gt;&gt; Magenta [4x]

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.340
&gt;&gt; Your favorite color in general?
&gt;&gt; I like certain blues, like teals.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.060
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh. I don't think we're going to see
any teal tulips unfortunately.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.090
&gt;&gt; Right. But it is good alliteration.
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.490
What is alliteration? This is when the
same sound begins words that are next to each

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:53.009
other, or in the same thought group. Teal
tulips. Rachel runs regularly.

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.669
&gt;&gt; This is my friend, Puck, who invited me
to the Netherlands. Thanks, Puck.

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.770
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.
&gt;&gt; So, Puck just taught me a very cool trick

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.840
about tulips. When you cut tulips and put
them in a vase, they droop.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.699
&gt;&gt; They do.
&gt;&gt; And what is the trick that you taught me?

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.449
&gt;&gt; They go in the vase, vase.

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:14.229
'Vase' has a couple of pronunciations. In
America, we generally say 'vase', with the

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.749
AY diphthong, and an unvoiced ending, ss.
In British English, and some Americans will

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:27.930
use this pronunciation too, the second sound
is the AH as in FATHER vowel, va-. And the

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.349
ending is voiced. Vase (4x).

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.099
&gt;&gt; Grow in the vase, vase...
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.060
&gt;&gt; And then they do this. Imagine this is
a tulip. It's a daffodil, but we'll...

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.039
&gt;&gt; Right. It's not a tulip, but pretend it
is.

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.279
&gt;&gt; Pretend it's a tulip. And then it goes
like this. Just underneath, one centimeter

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.829
from the flower, you just pinch a needle.
&gt;&gt; Stick a needle.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:58.699
&gt;&gt; Stick a needle though the stem. All the
way through. And then, they stand up.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.279
&gt;&gt; And that'll keep them from dropping. Now,
she also told me if it's already drooping,

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.330
and you stick a needle in, it will make it
come back up straight again.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.839
&gt;&gt; But you have to cut some piece of...
&gt;&gt; You have to cut some off the bottom. Ok.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.749
&gt;&gt; And then stick the needle.
&gt;&gt; I'm definitely going to use that tip because

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:18.729
I love tulips, and they're always dropping.
Now I know how to fix it. Thanks Puck.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.099
&gt;&gt; I have braces.
&gt;&gt; If you can't understand her, please forgive

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.529
her. She just got braces.

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:31.779
Thanks so much to Puck and Sara for being
in and helping me make this video. Always

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:38.110
remember to pay attention to word stress and
pronunciation as you learn new vocabulary words.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.110
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
