00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.110
In this American English pronunciation video,
you're going to play a card game with me and

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.260
my family and we'll study real English conversation
as it happens among real Americans.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.400
The focus of this video is numbers.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.460
Two ones. Two twos.  Two rooks.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.880
We're playing with a double deck of cards
here. That means we've combined two full decks

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.800
so there's going to be two of every kind of
card. So my mom says: two ones, two twos,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.060
two rooks.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.460
So rather than saying: two one cards, two

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.840
two cards, she's just shortening it into:
two ones, two twos, making the number a noun.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.440
So she's making it plural because there's
two of everything. Two ones. Adding a really

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.900
light Z sound at the end. Two ones. Two twos.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.380
Two ones. Two twos.&nbsp; Two rooks.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.060
But there are no sixes and sevens and half of the eights.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.080
Sixes and sevens and half of the eights.
So here, again, we're using the number as

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.660
a noun. And we're making it plural. Sevens
and eights.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:25.840
For 'sevens', we add a light Z  sound. For 'eights' we add an S sound. And for 'sixes', we add a whole syllable.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.960
Es—  es— sixes.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.340
The rules for how to pronounce a plural noun were laid out in a video that I made earlier.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.840
Click here to see that video or you can also find the link in the description  below.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.700
But there are no sixes and sevens and half of the eights.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.620
210. 210.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.760
How many points does...

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.140
- 360. 
- Ok. Yeah. Oh.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.760
So here, we've just heard
the numbers 210 and 360.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.040
Notice that the words 'hundred and' were dropped.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.240
You can say two hundred and ten or three hundred and sixty

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.720
but it's probably more common in spoken English to drop that and just say

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.800
210, 360.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740
210.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.860
210.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.140
How many-- How many points does...

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.460
- 360. 
- Ok. Yeah. Oh.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.880
-215
-20

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.860
Two fifteen. Twenty.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.360
So 15, how does that sound different from 250?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.760
Two fifteen. Two fifty.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.020
Two fifteen.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.260
There are two clues. First stress is on ‘teen’.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.020
In the words that end in a zero, stress is on the first  syllable.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.860
Fifteen. Fifty.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.780
Clue number two, the T in ‘teen’ is a true T because it starts a stressed syllable.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.700
The T in ‘fifty’ might be a true T or it might be flapped: fifty, fifty.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.700
Two fifteen.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.520
- 215
- 20

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.560
Twenty. My dad bids even higher.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.060
He didn't say 220 but it's implied.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.360
Twenty, What  happens to the T there?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.100
It's dropped. Americans often drop the T in this word.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.420
Twenty. Twenty.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.540
This  is because the T follows an N.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.780
20.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.720
Pass.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.740
Pass.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.440
As we go around bidding here, if you want to bid  higher, then you do so.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.760
If you don't want a bid higher and you  want to drop out, then you say: pass— pass—

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.380
Pass.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.600
Twenty five.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.080
Twenty five.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.100
Twenty. Again, David drops the T here: Twenty five.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.500
Twenty five.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.220
Thirty.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.579
Thirty. Thirty. Stress is on the first syllable

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.720
and it's a flap T so we know it's not ‘thirteen’.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.659
Thirty. Thirty. The T is flapped here because

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:22.400
it comes after an R before a vowel. Thirty.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.000
Try that: Thirty.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.740
Thirty.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.300
Pass.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.680
Pass.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.200
Oh, my mom and I both have bad hands.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.700
We both pass, we do not continue to bid.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.160
Pass.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.020
Pass.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.560
That's too cheap.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.360
Dad says: That's too cheap.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.080
He's trying to make us think he doesn't have a good hand but that he's going to bid anyway.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.420
He reduces the word ‘that's’ by  dropping the TH.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.220
At's— at's— At's too cheap.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.060
This is a reduction you will hear Americans do sometimes.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.680
Listen again.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.180
That's too cheap. That's too cheap. That's too cheap.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.480
Notice the word ‘too’ is stressed and
it sounds just like the number 2.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.980
These are homophones. They sound exactly the same. Even though they're spelled differently.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.780
That's too cheap.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.960
That's too cheap. Forty.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.720
Forty. He raises the bid.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:40.160
Different from 14 where stress is on the second syllable with a true T. Forty. Forty.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.460
Flap T because the T comes between an R and a vowel.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.900
Forty.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.820
Pass.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.740
Five.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.320
Yeah, I should have passed before.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.640
I should have passed before.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:03.200
Should have is often reduced to ‘shoulda’ in natural American English conversation.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.260
I should have passed before. Shoulda— shoulda— try that.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.440
A quick flap of the tongue for the D: shoulda—

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.800
I should have passed before. Because I think….

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.220
Because I... Okay my dad is doing a weird reduction here.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.780
First he's reducing ‘because’ to ‘cuz’ which is a very normal reduction.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.180
But then he's also dropping the TH in ‘think’ which

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.160
is a little bit less common though I have
noticed my dad definitely does this.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.400
Because I think— because I think— It makes it
a little less clear but to a non-native listener,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.940
it's still perfectly understood.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.540
Because I think— because I think— because I think—

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.980
because I think—

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.160
- Enough table talk. 
- I think…

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.800
‘Table Talk’. This idiom means the casual conversation that would happen at a meal

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.060
but my family uses it to mean talking about a card game when you're playing a card game

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.900
which you shouldn't do.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.240
When you're playing  a game. You should keep all strategy and thoughts on the game to yourself.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.300
So we say ‘no table talk’ or ‘enough table talk’.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.660
Everyone in my family is guilty of lots of table talk.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.100
- Enough table talk. 
- I think...

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.060
Fifty.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.520
Fifty.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.580
Now, again we have something that's not a true T: fifty,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.580
but more of a flap T: fifty.
Dadadada—

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.900
Now, this is an exception.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:44.000
It's not following the rules but still this
is how most Americans will pronounce this word.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.320
Fifty. Different from ‘fifteen’

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.680
where stress is on the second syllable and we have a true T.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.300
Fifty.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.680
And there's 360?

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.800
Yeah!

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.400
Three sixty.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.500
Again, a flap T. Sixty. d-- d--
And again this is an exception.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.300
It's not following the rules for the pronunciation of T.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.280
Sixty, three sixty.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.680
And there's three sixty?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.020
Yeah!

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.280
Cheap!

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.100
Pass.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.700
I'm gonna pass.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.520
I'm gonna pass.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.820
My dad pronounced
his ‘gonna’ very quickly.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.680
I'm gonna pass.

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:34.560
I'm gonna pass. Gonna— gonna— gonna—

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.160
I'm gonna pass.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.640
I'm gonna pass.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.000
I'm gonna pass.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.600
I'm gonna pass.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.500
Let's go back and listen to all the numbers again.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.340
I'll play this section twice. Practice out
loud the second time.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.460
Two ones. Two twos. Two rooks.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.960
But there are no sixes and sevens and half of the eights.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.640
Two ten!

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.880
Two ten!

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.300
-Two fifteen.
-Twenty.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.860
Twenty five.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.960
Thirty.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.580
Forty.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.560
Fifty.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.900
And there's 360?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah!

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.520
Five.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.820
Two ones. Two twos. Two rooks.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.300
But there are no sixes and sevens and half of the eights.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.840
Two ten!

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.180
Two ten!

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.440
-360
-Okay. Yeah. Oh.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.460
-Two fifteen.
-Twenty.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.980
Twenty five.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.220
Thirty.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.860
Forty.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.860
Fifty.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.240
And there's 360?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.340
Yeah!

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.700
Five.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.320
I had a lot of fun playing cards with my family

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.000
and I hope you had fun learning the pronunciation of numbers

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.940
as we studied Real English conversation.
