00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.810
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to learn some Vietnamese cooking,

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.010
and you're going to study contraction of the
verb TO BE.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.430
One thing to note about these contractions
is that no extra syllable is added. We'll

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.710
go over the pronunciations. You'll notice
that some of them have two different pronunciations.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.100
That's because there can be a reduced pronunciation.
I do recommend that you use the reduced pronunciation.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.149
Any time you can make a short word shorter
it's going to add better rhythmic contrast

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.530
to your speech.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:53.170
So, I am. I'm. I'm. You are. This can be 'your'
or, better yet, let's reduce it, 'yer'. Notice

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.109
how quick it is. When we reduce it, it's going
to be very, very fast, and it must be linked to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:09.640
the next word. 'We are' can be 'we're', or
'we're', or, better yet, wur, wur. Reduced.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:23.540
'They are' can be 'they're', or, reduced, thur.
He is, she is, it is. This will be come he's,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.180
she's, it's. Notice that the S in 'it's' is
pronounced as an S sound, unvoiced. That's

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.790
because the sound before is the T, also an
unvoiced sound. It's, it's. However, the S

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.310
in 'he's' and 'she's' is a Z sound. That's
voiced, because the sound before, a vowel,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.310
was voiced. He's, she's, it's. TS can be a
tough sound, and I do have a video on how

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.129
to make that sound. So let's take a look at
some contractions in everyday conversation.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.260
&gt;&gt; Alright, Annie. So after you peel the cucumber,
you're going to slice the cucumber into rounds.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.730
And then you're going to flatten the rounds,
and slice them lengthwise again to make it

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.230
into a nice julienne.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.680
Did you notice the contraction of 'you are'
to 'yer'? Yer, you're going to. Listen again.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.019
&gt;&gt; Alright, Annie. So after you peel the cucumber,
you're going to slice the cucumber into rounds.

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.069
And then you're going to flatten the rounds,
and slice them lengthwise again to make it

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.530
into a nice julienne.
&gt;&gt; How's this, HaQuyen?

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.879
&gt;&gt; It looks good, looks good, it's good.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:39.099
How's this? How's, how's, zz, zz, with a Z
sound. It's good. It is, it's, it's, with

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.489
that TS sound. Listen again.

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.090
&gt;&gt; How's this, HaQuyen?
&gt;&gt; It looks good, looks good, it's good.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.780
&gt;&gt; Well, if we look at the way Mark's chopping
his mushrooms, we can see that he's doing

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.319
quite a good job of it.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, HaQuyen.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.129
Mark's, Mark's. The last sound of Mark's name
is the K sound, unvoiced. So the apostrophe

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:13.670
S is also unvoiced. Ks, ks, Mark's, Mark's.
We also heard 'he's', where the apostrophe

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.620
S is a Z sound. He's, he's, he's doing. Listen
again.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.620
&gt;&gt; Well, if we look at the way Mark's chopping
his mushrooms, we can see that he's doing

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.309
quite a good job of it.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, HaQuyen.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.689
&gt;&gt; That's because she's a good teacher.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:39.730
Here, Natalie, speaking of HaQuyen, said that's,
that's, that's because, with the TS sound.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:48.040
She's, she's a good teacher. She's a, she's
a, where the apostrophe S is a Z sound. Listen

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.409
again.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.549
&gt;&gt; That's because she's a good teacher.
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to dice up this cucumber

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.430
as I was instructed.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to keep dicing the mushrooms.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:08.099
Here, both Annie and Mark said I'm gonna.
So, they have contracted I AM and also reduced

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:16.160
'going to' to 'gonna'. I'm gonna. Notice how
'I'm' is the most stressed syllable in that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.199
fragment. I'm gonna. That's because 'going'
is a helping verb here, not the main verb.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:32.030
The main verb is stressed. For example, Annie
said 'I'm gonna dice'. I'm gonna dice, Stressing

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.610
'dice'. Listen again.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.039
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to dice up this cucumber
as I was instructed.

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.870
&gt;&gt; I'm going to keep dicing the mushrooms.
&gt;&gt; Hey Annie, when are the noodles going to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.930
be ready?
&gt;&gt; They're going to be ready in about 10 minutes.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:57.449
They're gonna. Did you hear how Annie reduced
'they're' to thur, thur, thur, they're gonna.

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.810
They're gonna be ready. Listen again.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.320
&gt;&gt; Hey Annie, when are the noodles going to
be ready?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.300
&gt;&gt; They're going to be ready in about 10 minutes.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.099
&gt;&gt; I think we're all set with the basil.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Lori.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:17.900
We're all set. Did you hear Lori's reduction
of 'we're' to wur, wur, wur, we're all set.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.310
All set is a common idiom meaning ready, or
not in need of anything. Here, she is saying

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.199
the basil is ready for the dish. I use it
often at a restaurant, for example, when a

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:38.210
waiter asks if there is anything more I need.
Nope, I'm all set, I'll say. Listen again.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.090
&gt;&gt; I think we're all set with the basil.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Lori.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.780
&gt;&gt; I love HaQuyen. She's such an effective
teacher.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.669
&gt;&gt; That's true. HaQuyen, thanks so much for
teaching us how to make all this amazing food.

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.939
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming and joining me to eat
all this wonderful food.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.170
&gt;&gt; Any time. We will eat your food any time.
&gt;&gt; Yes, we will.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.449
&gt;&gt; Love it.

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:04.770
She's, she's, she's such, with the apostrophe
S pronounced as a Z. That's, that's true,

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.639
with the TS sound. Listen again.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.229
&gt;&gt; I love HaQuyen. She's such an effective
teacher.

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.489
&gt;&gt; That's true. HaQuyen, thanks so much for
teaching us how to make all this amazing food.

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:18.260
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming and joining me to eat
all this wonderful food.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.970
&gt;&gt; Any time. We will eat your food any time.
&gt;&gt; Yes, we will.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.930
&gt;&gt; Love it.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.509
&gt;&gt; I'm crushing it over here, as you may be
able to see.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.990
&gt;&gt; He's crushing it.
&gt;&gt; I'm adding noodles.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.159
&gt;&gt; I'm adding tofu.
&gt;&gt; I'm waiting for shrimp.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.069
&gt;&gt; I'm adding bean sprouts.

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:46.259
I'm. Lots of I'm in this clip. Also Mark used
the idiom 'to crush' -- meaning he thinks

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:52.000
he is doing an excellent job of making a summer
roll. There are lots of different ways to

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.240
use the word 'crush'. For example to say you
have a crush on someone means you like that

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.990
person, you have romantic interest in that
person. Let's listen again to all these I'm

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.729
contractions.

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.490
&gt;&gt; I'm crushing it over here, as you may be
able to see.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.780
&gt;&gt; He's crushing it.
&gt;&gt; I'm adding noodles.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.160
&gt;&gt; I'm adding tofu.
&gt;&gt; I'm waiting for shrimp.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.560
&gt;&gt; I'm adding bean sprouts.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.969
&gt;&gt; That chicken's looking good.

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:31.219
That chicken's looking good. Natalie contracted
'chicken is' to chicken's, that chicken's

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:37.139
looking good. And it was good. It was delicious!
Listen again.

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.830
&gt;&gt; That chicken's looking good.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.409
&gt;&gt; There is onion in there.
&gt;&gt; There's no onion in there.

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:43.379
&gt;&gt; I...
&gt;&gt; That one's mine.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.550
&gt;&gt; Wait, where's the onion? Oh, spring onion.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:55.819
There's no onion in there, where's the onion.
There's, where's. Both of these words end

00:07:55.819 --> 00:08:04.120
in the R sound, a voiced consonant, so the
apostrophe S is a Z sound. There's, there's.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.560
Where's, where's. There's no onion, where's
the onion. Listen again.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.390
&gt;&gt; There is onion in there.
&gt;&gt; There's no onion in there.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.470
&gt;&gt; I...
&gt;&gt; That one's mine.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.449
&gt;&gt; Wait, where's the onion? Oh, spring onion.

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:23.979
&gt;&gt; Annie, hold it up.
&gt;&gt; Look at that. That's absolute perfection.

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:25.539
&gt;&gt; It does look great.

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:34.089
You've got to love Annie's enthusiasm. That's
absolute perfection. That's, that's, again,

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:37.279
with the TS sound. Listen again.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:42.320
&gt;&gt; Annie, hold it up.
&gt;&gt; Look at that. That's absolute perfection.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.250
&gt;&gt; It does look great.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.830
&gt;&gt; Oh god, my dogs are barking.
&gt;&gt; Why is that, Hillary?

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.589
&gt;&gt; We've been walking around all day.
&gt;&gt; Not to mention all the dancing you did

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:53.000
last night.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it was amazing.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.130
My dogs are barking. This is a great idiom
to mean your feet are tired. My dogs are barking.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:08.899
Notice how the word 'are' is reduced to er,
er, er, My dogs are, my dogs are. My dogs

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:17.959
are barkin'. Notice also the ING is pronounced
as an IN. My dogs are barkin' instead of dogs

00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:24.569
are barking. You may find this happening sometimes
with certain phrases or idioms. Listen again.

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:28.340
&gt;&gt; Oh god, my dogs are barking.
&gt;&gt; Why is that, Hillary?

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.100
&gt;&gt; We've been walking around all day.
&gt;&gt; Not to mention all the dancing you did

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.260
last night.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it was amazing.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:40.610
I hope this has made you more aware of just
how often we use this kind of contraction.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:46.440
Watch this video a time or two. Then watch
an American TV show or movie, and see if you

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:54.250
can notice these 'to be' contractions. Write
them down as you watch and practice the phrases.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.430
Using contractions will really help your speech
sound more natural.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:05.059
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.

00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:08.000
Guys, that was fantastic.
