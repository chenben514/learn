00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
It’s 6:37 in the morning.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.760
That’s about how well my eyes focus when I get up.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.480
What time do you get up?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.620
I was recently at a YouTube conference where someone did a presentation on My Morning Routine.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.540
Different people across the world just taking their camera through their morning,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.700
showing people what their life is like and I thought: This is fascinating!

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.520
I loved seeing other cultures, seeing what people did, how they lived just a normal day.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.980
So I decided today, I'm going to do the same. I'm going to show you my morning routine.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.040
What is my morning like? And of course, we'll turn it into an English lesson along the way.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.820
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.880
I have a baby. What do you think the first thing I do every morning is?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.760
The first thing is always nurse Sawyer.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.900
He's a little too distracted by the camera to nurse right now.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.320
Nurse – this word has several different meanings.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.880
You can nurse a baby, you can nurse a sick person, you can nurse a cold, and you can even nurse a beer.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.280
We’ll go over these meanings.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.820
First, I want to say the verb ‘breastfeed’ can be used interchangeably with this term,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.800
and it doesn’t mean anything else, so that can be another option.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.960
The first thing I do every morning is breastfeed my baby.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.660
Notice that I’m not saying the T here – that’s common.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.660
When the T comes between two consonants, we often drop it.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.580
Breastfeed.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.560
Straight from the S sound in to the F sound.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.600
Breastfeed.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380
Now, let’s talk about all those different meanings.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.720
If we use this word as a noun, it’s somebody who's been trained as a nurse, to care for the sick, it’s an occupation.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020
My aunt is a surgical nurse.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.080
As a verb, like I used it, it can mean to breastfeed, to feed a baby.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.020
It can also be used to describe caring for someone who is sick:  she nursed him back to health.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.740
It can be used to describe taking care of an ailment:  I’ve been nursing a cold for two weeks.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.400
That means I’m taking throat lozenges for it, drinking lots of tea, trying to get better.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.280
We also use it to talk about a drink, usually an alcoholic one, that we’re drinking very slowly.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.840
Just taking a sip every once in a while.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.540
Rachel, can I get you a drink?

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.880
No thanks, I’m still nursing this beer.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.440
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.980
This is something new. This is different from our routine.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.920
Looking at a camera.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.780
One of the first things I try to do everyday is make the bed which I used to never do.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.940
But it's one tiny thing that I can do to create a little bit

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.620
of organization in a life that is otherwise very chaotic right now.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.520
 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.540
Chaotic, chaos.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.140
Here the CH makes a hard K sound.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.160
Kk--  It’s also common to make a CH sound, like in ‘chest’, ch-- or an SH sound, like in Chicago, sh--.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:03.000
CH makes a K in choir, echo, Chemistry, anchor, stomach, orchestra, and many others.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.960
You can’t tell how a CH should be pronounced just by looking at it, you have to know word by word.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.820
This is why spelling and pronunciation is so tricky in English.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.720
Then I head downstairs to have breakfast with Stoney and David.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.720
I don't feel like cereal so I'm going to make an egg. Does anybody want an egg?

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.580
I don't.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.260
&gt;&gt; No?
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.680
I used the phrase ‘feel like’.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.820
You can use this interchangeably with ‘want’, except the form of the verb will change.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.340
I feel like going to bed, I want to go to bed.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.460
So with ‘feel like’ we follow it with the ING form of a verb, feel like going.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.160
With ‘want’, the next verb is in the infinitive, want to go, wanna go.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.500
But the meaning of the two sentences is the same.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.780
This applies to the negative as well.  
I don’t feel like having cereal, I don’t want to have cereal.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.260
But when I said it, I followed it by a noun.
I don't feel like cereal so I'm going to make an egg.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.500
I don't feel like cereal.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.480
So nothing else changes

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.560
I don’t feel like cereal, I don’t want cereal.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.200
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.160
Hey Stoney, your mouth is totally full.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:28.920
So we can't understand you. So take your time, chew, swallow, and then say what you were trying to say.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.720
Good, daddy. It's good.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.180
It's good? The toast?

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.940
Yes.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.320
Looks like it's really good.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.860
The most common breakfast in the US is probably cereal with milk. That’s what David and Stoney had.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.080
What do you usually have for breakfast?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.900
Post it to Instagram, tag me, @RachelsEnglish, I love to see this kind of thing,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.140
what people eat in different cultures.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.080
Let’s have breakfast together.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.220
Mommy, I want some milk.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220
Okay. Well, how would you ask me to get you some milk?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.760
Milk, please?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.560
Sure.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.220
What time are you guys getting together?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.180
Here, David's talking about getting together with a friend and his kids.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.980
This is a phrasal verb that means to meet, to spend time together.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.440
You could also use it as a noun: we’re having a get-together at our house this weekend.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.180
Why don’t you come?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.560
If you use it with ‘it’, the meaning is different.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.120
'Get it together' means to get organized or get stabilized after chaos.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.440
For example, if Stoney is having a tantrum, we could say, ‘get it together, Stoney’.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.120
Or, at a busy time in my life lately, I missed a meeting because I totally forgot.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.280
I apologized and said, “I’m so sorry I forgot.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.100
I just can’t get it together these days.”

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.400
Get together is to meet.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.220
Get it together is to recover from a period of chaos.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.300
 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.140
Mommy, where is the flashing part?

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.760
Oh, I put it over there.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.080
There?

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.660
 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.300
The flashing part – here, Stoney is talking about a camera that had a blinking light.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.120
Did you notice that Stoney can’t say ‘there’ yet?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.020
There.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.360
He can’t make a TH.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.940
I’ve worked with him on it several times and he just can’t coordinate putting the tongue tip through the teeth.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.780
I know this is a huge challenge for my non-native students, so I just wanted you to know it takes time!

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.940
Stoney has been speaking English for over two years now, and he still doesn’t have that sound.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.800
There.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.240
I’m interested to see when he picks it up.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.840
And breakfast just continues with random loud noises.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:43.500
 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.140
The rest of the morning continues with cleaning up the kids.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.420
 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.380
Okay, let's get you cleaned up.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.280
How was 'get you' pronounced?

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.160
Have you noticed that it’s really common to hear a CH in this phrase?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.680
Let's get you cleaned up.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.860
When a word that ends in T is followed by ‘you’ or ‘your’, that T often turns into a CH.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.900
Chuu.  Chuu.  Ge-chuu.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.440
There's no rule about doing this or not.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.980
It's just a habit the happens and many Americans do it a lot of the time.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.460
If you don't do it, you can do a stop T.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.780
Get you, get you.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.680
Let's get you cleaned up.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.020
 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.940
 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.200
Stoney, you want these waffle pretzels for your snack, right?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.040
 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.360
Do you want one right now?

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.340
Yes.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.440
Special treat.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.980
 

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.900
Snack.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.860
We all need a good snack every once in a while.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.620
This is not a full meal, but a little bit of food that we eat between meals.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.120
Snack.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.960
At our house, we get up anywhere between 6 and 6:45.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.740
Stoney doesn’t leave for school until after 9, so we have a lot of time to fill up.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.580
Sometimes we go out for a walk, but often we just play at home.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.100
 

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.160
I've already got it all ready for you.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.120
Did you hear the ‘you’ reduction?

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.200
Yuh, yuh.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.040
I've already got it all ready for you.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.760
 

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.200
Hey, hey. We're not skipping teeth. Stand up. Stoney.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.820
 

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.620
We’re not skipping teeth.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.020
I’m sure many parents can relate to this.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.500
When you skip something, you don’t do something that is part of a regular sequence.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.180
In this case, brushing teeth in the morning is definitely part of our morning routine.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.680
Stand up.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.060
 

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.300
Mercy.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.560
Mercy.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.240
This is an exclamation of exasperation, surprise, anger, or frustration.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.720
I was feeling all of those things!

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.320
Luckily, he did decide to brush his teeth.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.060
And now, we brush teeth. It's just part of getting ready for school.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.960
 

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.140
My camera died, after that, we got Stoney dressed and David took him to school,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.140
then he came home and took Sawyer while I went to work. And that is our morning routine.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.660
I hope you liked this video. I hope you learned a little something.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.260
Please subscribe. I make new videos every Tuesday.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.960
Did you see anything that surprised you or learned anything new?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.620
Put it in the comments below, I love to hear what you're learning with the videos.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.000
That's it and thanks so much for using Rachel's English.
