00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:01.750
You asked for it.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.560
So in this American English pronunciation
video,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.610
we're going to do a Ben Franklin Exercise
where we take real American English conversation

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.579
and analyze the American accent to improve
listening comprehension

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.439
and pronunciation skills.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.300
First, let's listen to the whole conversation.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm going to call my mom.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.730
No idea if she's home.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.640
Let's see, it's 2:30 her time.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.520
We'll see if she picks up.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.320
She's not answering.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.540
Hey mom!

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.400
What's up?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.020
- Not much. How are you?
- Pretty good.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.900
- What are you doing?
- Roberta and Ernie are here.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.300
Oh, that's right!

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.830
Now, for the analysis.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.770
What would you say about the stress of those
first two words?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.140
Hey mom!

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.750
Hey mom!

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.960
To me, those sound like they're both stressed.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.520
Hey-- mom!

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.950
Hey mom!

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.100
Hey mom!

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.670
They both have huh--- huh--- a little bit
of that up down stress in the voice.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.010
Hey mom!

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.580
It's hard to hear my mom's response because
it's through the phone.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.440
What's up?

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.660
What's up?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.890
What's up?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.070
With the intonation going up.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.300
What's up?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.869
Very smooth and connected.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.729
The TS connected to the UH vowel.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.729
What's up?

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:41.729
Not much.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
How are you?

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.729
Not much.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.729
How are you?

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.409
I made a Stop T at the end of 'not'.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.169
We do this when the next word begins with
a consonant.

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:52.589
Not much.

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:54.110
How are you?

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.380
How did I pronounce the word 'are'?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.080
Not much. How are you?

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.700
I reduced it to the schwa R sound.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.340
Howwer-- howwer-- and connected it to the
word before.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.160
Howwer-- howwer--

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.920
Not much.How are you?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.960
How are you?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.570
How are you?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.460
With the pitch going down.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.240
Not much. How are you?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.240
Pretty good!

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.480
Pretty good!

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
How are those Ts pronounced?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.380
Pretty good!

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.140
Pretty good!

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.500
Like a Flap T or D. Pretty.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.899
Pretty.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.380
Pretty good!

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.900
These phrases are typical of starting a phone
conversation.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.220
You ask a person how they are.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.400
How are you?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.440
And they ask you how you are.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.550
What's up?

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.200
Generally, you give little generic responses.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920
Not much, pretty good.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.980
This is small talk.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.400
Hey mom!

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400
What's up!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.320
Not much. How are you?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
Pretty good!

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
What are you doing?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.920
Roberta and Ernie are here.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.240
Oh, that's right.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.100
Again, the word 'are'.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.260
What are you doing?

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.109
I reduced it to the schwa R sound whatterr--
whatter---

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.180
So the T became a Flap T between vowels.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.440
What are you doing?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.860
Whatter-- it sounds like one word, water. Water.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.900
What are you doing?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.820
I dropped the G to make just an N sound instead
of an NG sound.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.140
What are you doing?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.400
What are you doing?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.420
Roberta and Ernie are here.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.140
The word 'and' was reduced to nn--

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.760
Roberta and Ernie are here.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.860
Nn-- Roberta and Ernie

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.040
Roberta and Ernie are here.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.640
Again, R reduced to the schwa R sound Ernie -err-- Ernie -err--

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.280
Roberta and Ernie are here.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.780
Oh, that's right.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.280
How is the T pronounced in 'right'?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.600
Oh, that's right! --that's right!

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.840
It was a Stop T.
So we make a Stop T, unreleased, when the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.960
next sound is a consonant or at the end of
a sentence or thought.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.360
Oh, that's right. That's right.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.500
Alright, well have a good dinner tonight.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.060
Okay, we'll have fun.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.960
And now, phrases we use in getting off the
phone as you wrap up a conversation.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.380
Alright, well, have a good dinner tonight.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.720
Okay, we'll have fun.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.060
It's common for people to 'have fun' or 'have
a good time' with what they're doing next.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.429
Here, I'm commenting on their plans for dinner
tonight.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.540
Alright, well, have a good dinner tonight.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.479
In order to make this first word very quickly,
I dropped the L and make a Stop T.

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.519
Alright, well, have a good dinner tonight.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.560
Arright-- arright-- arright--
I also don't put these commas in, do I?

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.649
Alright, well, have a good dinner tonight.

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:09.889
I go straight to them without a pause.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.229
The first syllable of 'dinner' is stressed.

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.911
Have a good dinner tonight.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.689
Have a good dinner tonight.

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.590
Have a good dinner tonight.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.110
And it's the clearest syllable in that phrase.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.410
Notice 'tonight' is pronounced with the schwa.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.691
We want to do this all the time.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.860
Tonight, tomorrow, in both of those words,
the letter O makes the schwa sound.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.360
Tonight.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.300
How is the T pronounced?

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.960
Have a good dinner tonight.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.160
Tonight--
Another Stop T at the end of a sentence.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.200
Here again we're entering small talk to get
off the phone.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.720
I tell my mom to have a good time.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.060
She responds 'okay, we'll have fun.'

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.320
Alright, well, have a good dinner tonight.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.620
Okay. We'll have fun.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.320
The intonation of 'okay' goes up.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.939
It shows that she's not done talking yet.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.160
She's gonna saw one more thing.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.441
Okay.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.630
We'll have fun.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.810
The word 'fun' then goes down in pitch.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.680
So I know it's the end of her thought.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.860
Okay. We'll have fun.

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:22.960
Alright, well, talk to you guys soon.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.199
Enjoy New York.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.459
I will, thank you!

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.880
My next phrase again starts with 'alright, well'

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.960
Alright, well, talk to you guys soon.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.300
And again, to make that first word very fast,
I drop the L and make a Stop T.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.520
Alright well-- alright well--
Alright, well, talk to you guys soon!

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.780
Talk to you guys soon.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:53.220
Talk and soon, both stressed, both have the
up-down shape.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.390
Talk to you guys soon.Talk to you guys soon.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.480
Talk to you guys soon.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.800
The less important words like 'too' are very fast.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.960
I reduced the vowel into the schwa.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.340
Te-- te-- talkte-- talkte-- talk to you guys
soon.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.699
More small talk.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:18.759
Now, my mom is wishing me well and telling
me to enjoy what I'm doing.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.840
Alright, well, talk to you guys soon.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.100
Enjoy New York.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:29.060
Enjoy, have fun, these are the kinds of phrases
we say when ending a phone conversation.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.040
Enjoy New York.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.029
I will, thank you!

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.709
Bye.

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:34.949
Alright, bye!

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:39.180
And I just respond generically with a confirmation 'I will.'

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.540
I will, thank you.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.440
I will, thank you.

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:47.529
I will, thank you.

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:48.489
Bye.

00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:53.490
My mom actually says b-bye, doesn't she?

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.630
She makes the B sound twice.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.620
B-bye!

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.399
This is short for 'bye'. Bye.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:02.259
Just another way to say 'bye'.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.979
-Bye!
-Alright, bye!

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:09.479
I must really like the word 'alright' at the
end of the conversation because I say it one more time.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.160
Again, dropping the L and making a Stop T. Bye.

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:15.649
Alright, bye.

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:16.640
Bye.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.760
With the up-down shape of the voice.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.389
I will, thank you.

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:22.389
Bye.

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:23.490
Alright, bye.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.399
So in starting a phone conversation, we use
small talk asking someone how they're doing

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:30.409
and responding.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.160
Hey mom!

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.000
What's up?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.620
Not much, how are you?

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:36.229
Pretty good.

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:41.640
And in getting off the phone, we use small
talk often telling someone to have fun with

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.340
what they're about to do and saying bye.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.500
I will, thank you.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.160
- Bye.
- Alright, bye.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.840
Let's listen again following along with our
marked up text.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.110
You'll hear two different speeds.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.889
Regular pace and slowed down.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.540
Hey mom.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.240
What's up?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.700
Not much. How are you?

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.740
Pretty good.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.320
What are you doing?

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.060
Roberta and Ernie are here.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.580
Oh, that's right.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.540
Alright, well, have a good dinner tonight.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.340
Okay. We'll have fun.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.360
Alright, well, talk to you guys soon.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.460
Enjoy New York.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.160
I will. Thank you.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.960
Bye.
