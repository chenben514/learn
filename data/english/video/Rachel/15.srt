00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.200
Time to learn some vocabulary. Family relationships in American English.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.780
We’ll also go over a couple of idioms related
to family relationships.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.660
On a recent family vacation, I pulled my family aside and made them go on camera for you.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.000
So you’re going to get to see not only my
family, but you’re going to learn the words

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.900
we use when describing our relationships.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.020
And we’re really going to focus on pronunciation.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.280
For example, you should not be pronouncing
every sound in this word.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.340
And this word has two pronunciations.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.500
I’ll put the phonetics up with each word, and I really encourage you to practice out loud with this one.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
Listen to how it’s pronounced in real life,
and then practice it with me.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340
Let’s get started.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.420
This is my son, Nick.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.700
This is my dad, Steve.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.260
Son and dad.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100
When you have a child, it is a son or daughter.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.720
SON is pronounced with the very relaxed UH
as in BUTTER vowel.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.900
Suh-- son.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.200
And it sounds just like this word ‘sun’
as in, the sun in the sky.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.940
There is absolutely no difference in pronunciation.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.480
Son.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.500
Son.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.840
Say that with me.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.300
Son.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.460
Let’s watch that again.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.060
This is my son, Nick.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.560
This is my dad, Steve.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.180
Dad. This is casual, but the most common way to
say ‘father’.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.620
There have been only a few times in my whole
life that I’ve heard someone use the word

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.700
‘father’ outside of something official
like filling out a form.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.100
Dad is just what we use.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.940
Dad has the AA vowel.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.740
Jaw drop, tongue lifted in the back: da-- ah-- dad.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.500
Say that with me.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.480
Dad.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.170
Dad.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.020
A quick note about ‘father’.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.740
We can also use this idiomatically.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.580
In this case, it doesn’t mean the actual
biological father of someone, but we can use

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.760
it to mean a man who has innovated or founded
something.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.620
For example, in Philosopy, Petrarch is considered
to be the father of humanism'.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000
His writing and his ideas form the foundation
of humanism.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.360
Henry Ford was the father of the American
auto industry.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.260
Ok, let’s keep going.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.300
This is our mom.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.240
We're sisters.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.360
These are my daughters.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.420
Mom.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.240
Just like ‘dad’, it’s more causal but
also more common than ‘mother’.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.880
The letter O here makes the AH as in FATHER
sound.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.320
Mom.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.620
Say that with me.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.340
Mom.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.740
Mom.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.860
This is our mom.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.740
We're sisters.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.780
These are my daughters.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.440
Sisters. What a wonderful thing to have a sister.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.920
I don’t have one, but I hear they’re great.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.300
Two syllables, stress on the first syllable.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.520
The R can sometimes mess people up, keep it
simple, it’s unstressed, er, er, er.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.440
Sister. Say that with me.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.000
Sister.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.900
Sister.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.780
Sisters.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.170
Sisters.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.360
We're sisters.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.060
These are my daughters.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.340
Daughter.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.180
AUGH, four letters, making just one sound,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.240
the AW as in LAW sound, daugh--

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.040
Daughter. The T is a Flap T.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.820
We make a T a Flap T when it comes between two vowels.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.639
H is a consonant, but remember, these rules
don’t apply to letters, just sounds.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.000
So it does come between two vowel sounds.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.920
For the Flap, the tongue just bounces once against
the roof of the mouth ounce, ra- ra-

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.559
T, T. There’s

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.080
So there's no real tt-- T sound in it.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.480
Daughter. Daughter.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.140
In fact, most Americans would probably describe this flap as a D sound.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.460
Daughter.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.460
Just like ‘sister’, it ends in the schwa-R sound, simple and fast.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.260
rr-- rr-- rr-- daughter. Daughters.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.700
These are my daughters.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.180
We're husband and wife.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.580
This is my husband, Steve.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.660
So we have husband and wife.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.940
They’re married.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.920
Husband.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.120
Two syllables, stress on the first syllable.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.600
The second syllable has this letter A, but
really, it’s almost like there is no vowel in it.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.180
-band, -band, -band, Husband.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.760
Notice the S here should be pronounced with
a Z sound.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.820
Huzz, huzz, husband.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.540
We're husband and wife.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.920
This is my husband, Steve.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.820
Wife.  One syllable.  Wife.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.960
Lips go in to form a really rounded shape:

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.040
wwwwiiii---

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.860
Then jaw drop, they relax. Wife--

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.220
Then the bottom lip comes up and touches the bottom of the top front teeth.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.540
Wife.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.120
Wife.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.900
We're husband and wife.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.720
They are married.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.880
Marry.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.080
This can sound just like this word Mary or
this word Merry.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.740
Married.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.480
Married.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.500
Now don’t forget grandparents.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.720
This is my grandma.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.880
Grandma.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.460
The most common pronunciation of this has
two dropped sounds.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.380
You can drop the N and the D. Gramma.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.580
Grandma.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.860
So the vowel here is a little tricky.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.060
The AA vowel followed by M, gra--- aahh--

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.360
You want to relax it. AA-uh. Get an UH in there.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:05.420
Grandma. Gra-- Gra-- Gra-- Grandma.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.520
Grandma.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.800
This is my grandma.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.940
This is my father-in-law, Glen, and he's my son Stoney's

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.000
grandpa and he happens to be

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.360
an awesome grandpa because this is 
what an awesome grandpa looks like.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.760
Now there I said ‘grandpa’.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.720
Just like ‘grandma’, drop the D. But you
do need to keep the N sound.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:38.120
Or, some people definitely do change that
to an M. Grammmpa or grannnnpa.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.460
The M is probably the more common pronunciation.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.380
Gram-- grampa.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.280
So the tongue doesn’t go to the roof of
the mouth like it does for N,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:55.420
but the lips just close in anticipation for the P: grammm-- pa-- grampa--

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.400
And again, just like grandma, get the UH in there.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.600
Graa---- grammm--- grandpa.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.900
Grandpa. Say that with me, grandpa.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:16.060
This is my father-in-law, Glen, and he's my son 
Stoney's grandpa and he happens to be

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.660
an awesome grandpa because this is 
what an awesome grandpa looks like.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.300
Glen is my father in law.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.040
But first, your grandpa and grandma together are grandparents.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.360
Grandparents. You can drop the D.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.820
And make either an N or M. Grandparents.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.120
Grandparents.  Say that with me.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.180
Grandparents.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.440
This is my father-in-law, Glen--

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.980
Father-in-law. The-- in-law-- part happens when you get
married.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.060
He’s not my dad, he’s my husband’s dad.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.260
So he’s my father-in-law.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.419
Remember how I said we almost never use the
word ‘father’ in conversational English?

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.680
That’s true.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.940
But with the ‘in-law’, we always use it.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.500
We don’t say dad-in-law.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:13.700
So in an ‘in-law’ phrase, it’s never
the ‘in-law’ that is stressed.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.900
That's always unstressed. It’s always the other word that’s stressed.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.440
Father-in-law. Fa--- Father-in-law.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.660
Mother-in-law. Sister-in-law. Brother-in-law.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.040
One exception is if you just say ‘in-laws’.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.640
You don't put father, mother, brother, or sister in front.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.540
When you say in-laws, you stress the first word 'in'.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.140
And in this case, that means you spouse's parents.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.800
In-laws. My in-laws are coming next weekend.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.960
Say that with me. In-laws. Father-in-law.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.140
Mother-in-law.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.100
Sister-in-law.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.820
Brother-in-law.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.260
Now, just a bit ago, I mentioned the word ‘spouse’.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.720
One syllable word, this is the person that you're married to.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.100
Practice that with me: spouse. Spouse.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.620
This is my mother-in-law, Anabelle.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.380
Mother-in-law. Stress on MUH. Mother-in-law.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.220
This is my mother-in-law, Anabelle.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.520
This is my oldest sister, Audrey.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.080
Now here, David said oldest sister.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.480
He has three sisters.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.200
They’re all older than him, and Audrey is
the oldest.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.020
He could have also just said ‘older sister’.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.140
Older, oldest, younger, youngest.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.060
A couple of things to note about these pronunciations:

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.280
Oldest sister, oldest sister.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.100
David dropped the T in ‘oldest’.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:56.000
He just pronounced it ‘oldest sister’,
connecting with an S sound.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.060
Listen again.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.400
My oldest sister-- My oldest sister-- My oldest sister--

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.140
We often drop the T between two consonants.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.080
The same would also be true for ‘oldest brother’.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.300
We could just drop the T there because it’s between two other consonants.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.860
Oldest brother.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.940
These are very natural and common pronunciations
of these phrases.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:23.000
The same would be true in ‘youngest sister’
and ‘youngest brother’.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.360
You can drop the T there: youngest sister, youngest brother.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.500
One thing I think is interesting about the
word ‘young’:

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.060
the word on its own is pronounced with the NG ending.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.370
Young. Ng--- No G sound.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.900
But when you add ‘-er’ or ‘-est’, younger--

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.740
youngest, g-g-g-- we DO say the G.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.160
Younger, gg, gg, gg.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.820
Youngest, gg, gg, gg.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.640
What about ‘brother’?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.760
This is my brother, Ian.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.520
Two syllables, stress on the first syllable.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.840
Brother, brother.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.220
Same ending as sister, mother, and father.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.400
All of these THER endings, these are tricky.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.600
This one has a voiced TH right in the middle, and
I know that can be a challenging sound.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.860
It’s just the very tip that comes through.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:27.220
Th-- th-- Light, don’t hold the air: th, th, th.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.020
Broth, th, th, ther-- ther--

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.140
Moth, th, th, ther-- ther--

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.100
ther-- brother--

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.160
This is my brother, Ian.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.480
I'm Stoney's uncle because I'm married to David's sister.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.780
Okay, maybe it would be useful now to look
at a family tree.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.220
Leon is Stoney's uncle

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.620
because Leon married Audrey

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.740
who is the daughter of Glen and Anabelle

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.280
And David is the son of Glen and Anabelle.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.120
And Stoney is the son of David.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.560
Therefore, Leon is Stoney's uncle.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.620
Uncle. We have the letter N, but it’s actually
the NG sound because it’s followed by K

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:28.500
Unk--- uncle-- un-- un-- NG sound. Uncle.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.960
A quick dark L at the end. Uncle: ull--ull--ul--

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:40.860
You don’t need to lift your tongue tip, just make a sound with the backof the tongue. Ull-- ull-- ul-- very short.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.340
Uncle, uncle.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.620
The word uncle can be used idiomatically to
mean, I give up.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.980
For example, if I was wrestling you and I
had you pinned to the ground, you might say

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:59.740
“uncle”, which is, I give up, you won,
get off of me.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.240
Uncle.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.180
I'm Stoney's uncle as well.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.100
And what's your relationship to each other?

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.080
We're brother-in-laws.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.680
Steve is Stoney's uncle

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:16.180
because Steve married Lisa, who is the daughter of Glen and Anabelle

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.780
and David is also a child of Glen and Anabelle.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.720
Steve is Stoney's uncle.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.320
Steve and Leon are brothers-in-law.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.020
They're in the same line here but they are not biological siblings.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.220
And what's your relation ship to each other?

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.140
We're brother-in-laws.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.820
This is our aunt.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.320
Don't I have a great family?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.480
Aww. That was a bunch of kids from this level.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.900
Anyone from this level referring to a female on this level,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.640
is going to call that person 'Aunt' unless of course it's the mother.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.840
So I'm over here and those kids were all from here.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.340
So I'm their aunt.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.700
You may have noticed they used the pronunciation ‘aunt’

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.320
and I used the pronunciation ‘aunt’.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.240
Aunt is more common, and it’s pronounced
just like this word ‘ant’

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.260
even though the spelling is different.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.820
Aunt or aunt.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.980
Practice these with me.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.160
Aunt.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.880
Aunt.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.720
This is our aunt.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.120
Don't I have a great family?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.840
We are cousins.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.360
Cousins. So anyone who is the child of your aunt or uncle is a cousin.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.520
So everyone in this level

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.140
relates to each other as cousins.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.540
Not up and down but side to side.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.520
Up and down is called siblings and we'll get to that in a minute.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.820
Cousin.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.440
Just like ‘husband’, the letter S is the
Z sound here.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.680
Cous, zz, zz, cousin.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.680
Practice that with me.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.500
Cousin.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.240
Cousin.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.160
We are cousins.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.100
This is my nephew, Jacob. He is my husband's sister's son.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.400
Nephew.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.840
Two syllables, stressed on the first syllables.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.400
PH makes the F sound, just like in the word ‘phone’ or 'pharmacy'.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.940
Say it with me.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.060
Nephew.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.600
Nephew.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.300
This is my nephew, Jacob. He is my husband's sister's son.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.900
These are my nieces.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.580
Niece. One syllable, EE vowel.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.620
Ending S sound.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:54.500
In the plural, nieces, the S adds not just a
sound but a second syllable: nieces-- iz-- iz-- iz-- iz--

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.960
Words that end in the S sound get an extra
syllable in plural.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.920
To see all the plural noun rules, check out this video,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.140
and I’ll put a link to it in the description as well.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.660
Practice these with me: niece-- nieces--

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.220
These are my nieces.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.300
We are siblings.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:21.380
People who have the same parents or even one same parent are siblings.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.100
Audrey, Lisa, Christina, and David.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.600
All have the same parents, they are siblings.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.820
This set would also be siblings. This set would be siblings.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.300
And this set would be siblings.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.280
Poor Stoney has no siblings.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.740
Sibling. This  is a two-syllable word with stress on the first syllable.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.860
Sibling.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:17:01.100
The B releases right into the L, bl, bl, bl. Sibl-- sibl-- sibling-- sibling--

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.720
We are siblings.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.460
This is my grandson, Jacob and my granddaughter, Emily.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.900
Grandson 
and granddaughter.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:18.380
For grandson, drop that D. Gran-- Grandson, grandson.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.880
Try that with me.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.480
Grandson.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.640
For granddaughter, well, we need it. 
 Because it’s part of ‘daughter’.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.020
Granddaughter.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.340
Granddaughter. Stress is on the first syllable.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.620
Try that with me:  granddaughter-- grandson--

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.160
granddaughter--

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.240
This is my grandson, Jacob and my granddaughter, Emily.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.880
This is my boyfriend.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.500
This is my girlfriend.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.980
How cute are they?

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.740
When you’re dating someone, you can call
them your boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.260
Both two-syllable words with stress on the
first syllable.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.780
Try them with me: boyfriend-- girlfriend--

00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:07.800
Boyfriend, girlfriend.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.680
This is my boyfriend.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.260
This is my girlfriend.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:20.960
A couple more terms: If someone’s sperm
or egg makes a baby, that is their biological child.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.620
Biological.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.900
Someone can also adopt a child that is not
biologically theirs.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:33.100
If someone has children alone or with one
partner, and then gets married to someone else later,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:38.120
that person’s children are now
the stepchildren of the new partner,

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.960
and that new partner is a stepmom or stepdad.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.600
Notice in these compound words, the word ‘step’
is stressed.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.040
Notice also we do not release the P: stepmom-- stepmom--

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:58.800
The lips close for the P, but then just
keep going with the next sound: step-- mom--

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:08.240
Stepmom, stepdad, stepdaughter, stepson, step
brother, stepsister.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.220
A companion podcast will be released tomorrow

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.200
