00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.950
In this American English pronunciation video,
I'm not going to teach you anything about

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.450
pronunciation.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.549
This year for Christmas, I've come to my parents
house in Florida. This is where I grew up.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.170
Here is our beautiful tree. Let me show you
some of my favorite ornaments.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.420
This ornament is one that I gave my mother
when I was probably about 7. Um, no one in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.710
my family is blonde, I don't think I even
had any blond friends, and I certainly didn't

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.930
have a mint green jump suit, but something
about this ornament called to me, and so I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.960
purchased it for her.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.960
This is my mother's favorite ornament. Many,
many years ago. 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.410
As I grew up in Florida, not

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.149
terribly far from Disney World, it's fitting
that we have a Mickey ornament.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.480
Now, I said I wasn't going to teach you anything
about pronunciation, but there's one thing

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.059
I can't resist. Did you notice how I said
Florida, Florida. I'm from Florida, and that's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.469
how I say that phrase, Florida, Florida. A
lot of people will pronounce that with a third

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:13.369
syllable in there. That's ok, Florida, Florida.
Must make sure you don't pronounce it Florida,

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:21.159
ee, ee, ee, we don't want that ee vowel in
that middle, unaccented syllable. Either Florida

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.159
or Florida, Florida.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:43.070
Silent Night, holy night.
All is calm, all is bright.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:59.890
Round yon virgin, mother and child.
Holy infant, so tender and mild.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:19.289
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:25.949
From my family to you and yours, happy holidays,
and have a great 2013.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.599
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
