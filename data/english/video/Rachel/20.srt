00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.770
In this American English Pronunciation video,
you’re going to come with me on vacation

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.400
to study real life English conversation.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.460
- Oh my God! That’s amazing.
- Poor Gina!

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.140
That is so cute.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.200
Every year, my extended family gets together
for a week to play, swim, and have fun together.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.240
First, let's head to the beach.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.700
- Hey Ri! You enjoying the beach?
- Yeah.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.940
- Except for you got a face full of water?
- Yeah!

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.040
Except for you got.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.540
Let’s talk about the phrase ‘except for’, it’s pretty common.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.160
The T comes between two consonant sounds,
and in that case, natives often drop the T sound.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.560
I did.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.340
Except for--

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.860
Just the P then the F, excep’for.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.480
Also, notice that I reduced the word ‘for’.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.640
Fer, fer.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.801
Except for--

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:04.610
Except for you got.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.950
Listen again.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.850
Except for you got...

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090
- a face full of water?
- Yeah!

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.470
- What happened? Tell me about it.
- It got bigger.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.880
- Well, it got my no [nose!], that I, I start
choking.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.039
Oh no! She started choking! So glad she’s alright.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.500
Well this is the perfect day for him. Overcast and warm.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.540
How did my mom pronounce the word AND?

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.360
She reduced it to ‘n’. Just the N sound. Listen again.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.020
Well this is the perfect day for him. Overcast and warm.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.320
Overcast and warm.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.540
This is how it’s normally pronounced,
unless you want to stress the word ‘and’.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.520
Here, my cousin stresses it:

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.620
What about standing up like Gigi?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.880
Check this out: she can pull hair and
stand up at the same time.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.420
She can pull hair and stand up at the same
time.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.850
“And”, fully pronounced.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.320
Pull hair and stand up--

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.270
Most of the time, you’ll want to reduce
this, nn, just like my mom.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.000
Overcast and--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.500
Can you wave, Gina? Hi!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.000
Can you wave?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.670
We reduce ‘can’ when it’s a helping
verb, that is, not the main verb in the sentence.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.850
WAVE is the main verb.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.580
Most of the time, ‘can’ is a helping verb: kn, kn.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.200
Can you wave?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.660
Listen again.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.600
Can you wave, Gina?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.650
Hi!

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.830
On this day, it happened to be Gina’s first birthday.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.890
We sang happy birthday to her. Do you know this song?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.100
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:17.320
Happy birthday dear Gina! Happy birthday to you!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.340
And now onto meal time.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.480
-How's the meal?
-The lasagna’s pretty good.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.620
Not quite as good as Marlise’s, but not bad.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.740
Pretty good.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.760
We use this phrase a lot.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.440
It means okay, but not great.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.710
How are you?

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.060
Pretty good.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.880
How was the movie?

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.790
Pretty good.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.480
What do you notice about the pronunciation?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.100
The lasagna’s pretty good.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.800
Pretty, pretty.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.060
That’s a Flap T. Not a True T, pretty, but a Flap T, pretty.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.720
This is the American English pronunciation.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.720
I write it with a D, but depending on your
native language, it may sound like an R to you.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.560
Just flap the tongue against the roof of the
mouth without stopping the air.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.620
Pretty.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.760
The lasagna’s pretty good.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.720
Pretty good, with the UH as in PUSH vowel.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.919
My uncle makes it very clear.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.520
See if you can imitate him.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.380
Pretty good.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.240
You wanna go watch the tennis game?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.400
Wanna

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.740
‘Want to’ shifting to ‘wanna’ in conversation.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.351
You wanna go watch?

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.580
Listen again.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.880
You want to go watch the tennis game?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.300
My family loves to play tennis on vacation.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.240
Very few of us are any good at it.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.080
These are the fans out for the big match.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.620
These are the fans.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.720
Did you notice how my dad reduced the word ‘are’?

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.891
These are, these are.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.380
This is how we pronounce ARE, it just sounds
like an extra syllable at the end of the word before.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.740
These are.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.279
These are the fans. Listen again.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.339
These are the fans...

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:26.379
out for the big match.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.360
Don’t go easy on him, Ernie.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.720
Easy on him.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.860
What do you notice about the word ‘him’?

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.460
No H!

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.180
We pronounce ‘him’ this way a lot.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:45.140
Just like ‘are’, when it’s reduced, think of adding
an extra syllable to the end of the word before it.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.291
On him, on him.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.360
Easy on him.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.660
Listen again.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.360
Don’t go easy on him, Ernie.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.180
Let me go check on him.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.620
Here’s another HIM reduction: Check on him.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.669
On him, on him, on him.

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.049
Listen again.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.160
Check on him.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.720
Um, wait, when did you meet Gigi in Colorado?

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.380
When did you meet?

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.840
Did you, did you.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.580
Did you, would you, could you, should you:
all common two-word phrases.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.440
We often make the Y sound a J sound when it comes after a D.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.380
Diijew, jj, jj, jj.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.600
Did you.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.119
Listen again.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.880
When did you meet Gigi...

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.680
...in Colorado. When was that?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.480
- Uh, we were out there to ski in March.
- Okay

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.760
Anybody want to hit a few with my partner?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.560
Anybody wanna hit a few?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.580
Did you hear that in the background?

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.840
Wanna. Listen again.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.100
Anybody want to hit a few--

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.400
...with my partner?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.500
- Yeah, I will!
- Warm him up?

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.840
I'll warm him up.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.581
Again, dropping the H in ‘him’.

00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:07.901
Warm him, warm him.

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:14.369
I’ll warm him up.

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:16.369
Can you grab it? Nice!

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.440
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.900
That’s what she thinks of your hat.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.180
Thinks uh’ your hat.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.120
You’ll notice that we sometimes drop the
V sound in ‘of’; we just use the schwa.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.340
Uh.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.620
Thinks of, thinks of your hat.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.040
Listen again.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.080
She thinks of your hat.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.800
- Hello!
- Stoney, who's this?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.240
- This is Stoney!
- Your cousin!

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.760
- Oh, don’t whack her in the head.
- Don’t let him put his mouth on that, Dad.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.860
It's probably gross.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.480
Don’t whack her in the head.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.680
Did you notice the dropped H in ‘her’?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.480
Just like with ‘him’.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.500
Wacker, wacker.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.880
Listen again.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:04.020
Don’t whack her in the head.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.720
You can’t chew that.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.180
Man, it’s such a nice evening.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.360
Perfect temperature, slight breeze, beautiful sun.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.920
That it is.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.500
Listen to how I talk about the weather:

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.220
Man, it’s such a nice evening.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.700
Perfect temperature, slight breeze, beautiful sun.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.320
That it is.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.840
Perfect temperature.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.760
Notice I only make one T: Perfect temperature.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.580
So you can think of dropping the T in ‘perfect’,
because you have one beginning the next word.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.740
Perfect temperature.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:51.100
Also, I make ‘temperature’ just three
syllables: TEM-per-chur.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.820
This is an easier pronunciation.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.900
Temperature, perfect temperature.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.200
Perfect temperature

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.260
Slight breeze

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:09.530
I made the T in ‘slight’ a stop T because
the next word begins with a consonant.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:17.200
Slight breeze, slight breeze.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.960
Beautiful sun.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:25.320
The T in ‘beautiful’ is a Flap T because
it comes between two vowels.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.590
Beautiful

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.780
Beautiful sun

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.180
Man, it’s such a nice evening.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.620
Perfect temperature, slight breeze, beautiful sun.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.020
That it is.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.700
Going out might be sort of fun.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.060
Except for that I don’t want to have to go forever.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.080
Except for!

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.320
Did you hear that phrase again?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.680
Sep-fer-thut.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.700
I reduced ‘except’ to just ‘sep’,
without releasing the p.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:10:03.280
I also reduced ‘for’ and ‘that’ – ‘that’
had the schwa and a Stop T. Sep-fer-thut.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.840
Except for that. Listen again.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.080
Except for that

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.320
I don’t want to have to go forever.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.220
Wanna.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.380
Another ‘wanna’.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.700
I don’t want to have to go forever.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.140
- I don’t want to have to drive very far.
- No.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:25.440
Do you want to color?

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.200
Wanna. Wanna color.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:34.520
Do you want to color?

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.360
Is he messing up your coloring, Lydia?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.160
Is he messing you up? Should we move him?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.680
Move him.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.880
Dropped H in ‘him’.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.200
Move him, move’um.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.620
Should we move him?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.120
No. No. Tell them no.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.320
Tell them no.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.500
My aunt is dropping the TH in them, tell um, tell um.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.080
This sounds just like ‘him’ when the H is dropped, um, um.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.000
Move um, tell um.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.480
They sound the same when they’re reduced. That’s okay.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.360
Tell them no.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.060
It’s alright.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.100
No, it’s alright.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.550
We also went skiing.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:34.710
When I get tired, this is how I end.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.590
David is a little less graceful.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.040
Haha!

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.080
He’s down!

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.620
What I fun week I had with my family playing
games, swimming.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.540
They’re special people, and I can’t wait
to see them again!

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.650
I hope you liked this video.
