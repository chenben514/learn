00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.120
&gt;&gt; Hey guys. It’s fall, and I’m here with
my friend Laura.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.640
&gt;&gt; Hey!
&gt;&gt; You’ve probably seen some of our other

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.170
baking videos. Every fall, I come up to Massachusetts,
where Laura lives, and we make a variety of

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.210
things. One year we made a pumpkin pie, which
we’re making this year, but not in the video.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.890
But this year, we’re going to focus on apple
dumplings. Not apple fritters. So, if you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.640
want to learn how to make apple dumplings,
you should probably look it up because this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.000
is not really a recipe video. But this is
a real life English video where you get to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.520
study English conversation happening as it
actually does.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.140
&gt;&gt; So, you’re going to do the apples?
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.370
&gt;&gt; Okay. I’ll make the pastry.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.850
As always, there are lots of reductions to
study in American English. Did you notice

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.600
‘gonna’? This is how Americans pronounce
‘going to’ much of the time. Listen again.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.740
&gt;&gt; So, you’re going to do the apples? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.160
&gt;&gt; Okay. I’ll make the pastry.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.630
I used this reduction with another reduction,
yer. The ‘you are’ contraction, you’re,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:33.299
is reduced this way in a sentence. Yer. Yer
gonna. Repeat that. Yer gonna, yer gonna.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.820
Let’s hear it again.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.880
&gt;&gt; So, you’re going to do the apples? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.270
&gt;&gt; Okay. I’ll make the pastry.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.119
The ‘I will’ contraction, I’ll, is often
reduced. Then it sounds more like ‘all’,

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:00.519
all. I’ll make. Repeat that with me. I’ll,
I’ll make. Listen again.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.660
&gt;&gt; I’ll make the pastry. [3x]

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.129
&gt;&gt; Wait. Is this a cup?
&gt;&gt; Yes. It is.

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.860
&gt;&gt; You sure?
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.040
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.219
&gt;&gt; I’m using this one, just…
&gt;&gt; Wait. Just let me see them.

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:25.819
A couple of things to notice about this sentence:
The T in the word ‘just’ was dropped.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:33.180
We often drop the T when it comes between
two consonants, as it does here. Juss-let,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:45.370
juss-let. Next, ‘let me’ became ‘lemme’.
The T was totally dropped. The two words ‘let

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.849
me’ are often pronounced together this way.
Lemme see, lemme try. Repeat that with me.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:05.180
Lemme, lemme, lemme see. And finally, the
reduction of ‘them’ to ‘um’. This

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:16.069
is another common reduction. Repeat that with
me. Um, um. I have a video on this reduction.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:23.809
See it by clicking here or in the description
below. Let’s do the sentence slowly together:

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:37.270
Juss-lemme-see-um. [3x]. Listen again.

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:45.909
&gt;&gt; Just let me see them. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they’re the same.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:52.980
The ‘they are’ contraction, they’re,
can also be reduced. Rather than fully pronouncing

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:03.180
‘they’re’, it’s ‘thur’. The TH
sound and the R sound. Thur. Try that. Thur,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.979
they’re the same. Listen again.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.429
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they’re the same. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Okay?

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.520
&gt;&gt; I just feel more comfortable using the
one that says it’s a cup.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.580
The word ‘comfortable’ looks like it should
have four syllables, but most Americans pronounce

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:33.230
it with three. I pronounced it COMF-der-ble.
I made a video on just this word already,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:41.990
you can see it by clicking here or in the
description below. COMF-der-ble. Listen again.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.570
&gt;&gt; I just feel more comfortable [3x] using
the one that says it’s a cup.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.960
&gt;&gt; Now Laura, for how many years did you train
as a pastry chef?

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.760
&gt;&gt; Fifteen.
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That’s a lot of training.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.460
&gt;&gt; Well, but, wait. Fifteen minus the fifteen
years that I didn’t train.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.810
&gt;&gt; Neither of us are professionals here.
&gt;&gt; No.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.610
&gt;&gt; I know it looks like we are with our methods.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.900
Neither, neither, this word can be pronounced
both ways. Sometimes people think one way

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.690
is British and one way is American, but either
one sounds just fine in American English.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.700
&gt;&gt; Okay. Where is the new flour?
&gt;&gt; In the bag.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.220
&gt;&gt; I had a fan write in and tell me that I
don’t follow the rules for the pronunciation

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.720
of the word ‘the’.
&gt;&gt; Oh really? What are the rules?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.190
&gt;&gt; Well, and I noticed just then that I did
not use it correctly.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:54.370
The rule is, if the word after ‘the’ begins
with a consonant sound, pronounce it ‘the’,

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:02.740
with the schwa vowel, uh, uh, the. If the
word after ‘the’ begins with a vowel or

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:11.860
diphthong, then pronounce it ‘the’, with
the EE as in SHE vowel, ee, ee, the.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.220
&gt;&gt; Um, the. It should be a schwa before, before
a consonant. So, I said, “where’s the

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.990
new”, but I said “where’s theeee new”,
and I said ‘theee’, and you’re really

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.560
only supposed to do that before vowels. But,
since that person pointed it out, I noticed

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.370
that I do that quite a bit.
&gt;&gt; So it’s not like it would be strange.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.750
&gt;&gt; It’s not strange. Because no one has
ever said, Rachel, shouldn’t that be ‘the’.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.170
Like, no native speaker has ever noticed.
&gt;&gt; Right. And I didn’t even think about

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.230
it when you just said it.
&gt;&gt; No. No one thinks about it.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.890
If you ever say ‘thuh’ instead of ‘thee’,
people probably won’t notice. Also, make

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:59.940
sure to always keep this word short, whether
it’s with the schwa or the EE vowel, the, the.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.340
&gt;&gt; This is a very large bag of flour. Okay.
Now, I’m just curious, how much of it can

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:12.230
I spill. I’m guessing quite a bit.
&gt;&gt; We have a vacuum.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.180
&gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, crap.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:22.000
Crap. This is a word you can use when you
mess something up. To mess something up is

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:29.190
an idiom meaning, to do something the wrong
way, or to cause an outcome other than what

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:37.200
you intended. I turned left instead of right
--- I messed up. ‘Crap’ is like a cuss

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.180
word, but less offensive. Still, you don’t
want to use it in a professional setting,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.770
and some people might be offended by it. I
think it’s fine to use in a casual setting

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:57.930
among friends. Crap, crap. This is the less
offensive version of the word ‘shit’.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:04.380
&gt;&gt; Oh, crap. [3x]

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.990
&gt;&gt; What was the article in that Mark was reading
about trans fats?

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.640
&gt;&gt; I don’t know.
&gt;&gt; The Atlantic?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.610
&gt;&gt; I don’t think so. He’s been on this
kick for a while, so.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:23.070
Let’s go back and study the phrase “I
don’t know.” Notice how Laura dropped

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:32.169
the T altogether: I don’t know. I don’t
know. In the phrase ‘I don’t think so’,

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:38.829
there was a little break in the sound before
‘think’, I don’t think so, the sign

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:46.550
of a Stop T. But in ‘I don’t know’,
there was no stop, no T at all. This is a

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:55.589
common pronunciation of this phrase. I don’t
know. I don’t know. Listen again.

00:08:55.589 --> 00:09:01.449
&gt;&gt; I don’t know [3x].
&gt;&gt; The Atlantic?

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:05.399
&gt;&gt; I don’t think so. He’s been on this
kick for a while, so.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:08.180
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
&gt;&gt; I like how you just used the idiom ‘to

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.459
be on a kick’.

00:09:09.459 --> 00:09:16.910
The idiom to be on a kick means to be enthusiastic
about something for a period of time. "I’m

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:24.040
on a yoga kick" means, I don’t typically
do a lot of yoga, but recently I’ve

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:31.699
done it a lot and enjoy it. Or you could say,
I’m on a salad kick. I’ve been eating

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:39.329
a lot of salad lately. Here, Mark is on a
trans fat kick. He’s careful not to eat

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:42.110
trans fats. Listen again.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:49.149
&gt;&gt; He’s been on this kick for a while, so.
[3x]

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:51.249
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:53.350
&gt;&gt; Oh, whoops.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:10:00.800
Before, I said ‘crap’ when I messed up.
Here, I said ‘whoops’ , which, just like

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:08.709
‘oops’, is an exclamation for recognizing
a mistake. This term is not offensive in any

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:18.360
way, and can be used in any context. Oh, whoops,
with the same vowel as ‘book’ or ‘could’.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.819
Whoops, whoops. Listen again.

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:25.579
&gt;&gt; Oh, whoops. [3x]

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:32.929
&gt;&gt; How’s it going, Laur?
&gt;&gt; It’s going. Last half.

00:10:32.929 --> 00:10:33.850
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:40.289
&gt;&gt; And we’re done. Look at those beauties.

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:43.269
&gt;&gt; So Laura, you’re working on the sauce?

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:51.490
Another ‘you are’ yer reduction. I dropped
the NG sound and made an N sound on the end

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.109
of ‘working’.

00:10:54.109 --> 00:11:01.329
&gt;&gt; So Laura, you’re working on the sauce?
[3x]

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:10.490
Workin, working. Native speakers do this quite
a bit, especially with the most common ING

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:20.490
verbs, but I do caution my students against
overuse. Pronounce ING words with the NG sound

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.149
most of the time.

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:27.300
&gt;&gt; So Laura, you’re working on the sauce?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It’s a syrup for the top of the

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.509
dumplings.
&gt;&gt; Syrup.

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:35.619
&gt;&gt; A little butter in there. A lot of sugar.

00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:40.819
&gt;&gt; So I’m rolling the pastry. And then we’ll
put an apple inside.

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:49.410
Another reduction of a contraction, we well.
We’ll. Pronounce this as ‘wul’ in a

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:56.459
sentence. It’s faster than ‘we’ll’.
And we want an unstressed word like this to

00:11:56.459 --> 00:12:04.659
be very fast, wul. Repeat that with me, wul,
wul.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:13.680
&gt;&gt; And then we’ll put an apple [3x] inside.
I’m … they’re not as pretty as they’re

00:12:13.689 --> 00:12:21.079
supposed to be. But, I think the flavor will
be just as good.

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:29.160
As you listen to the next section, listen
for all the reductions ‘and’ to ‘nn’

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:37.699
or ‘an’. No D sound. This is how we usually
say this word in a sentence.

00:12:37.699 --> 00:12:51.079
&gt;&gt; Cinnamon and sugar. Then an apple half.
And then more cinnamon and sugar. And then

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:54.459
fold it up. It’s a little sticky.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.080
&gt;&gt; It’s been a half hour.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:12.800
‘It has’ reduces to ‘it’s’. How
was it pronounced in that sentence?

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.499
&gt;&gt; It’s been a half hour. [3x]

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:29.019
Simply the TS cluster. Ts been, ts been. Repeat
that with me. Ts been. Ts been a half hour.

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:36.999
It’s, that’s, and what’s, all reduce
to the TS cluster. Check out the video I made

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:41.449
on this topic by clicking here or in the description
below.

00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:50.580
&gt;&gt; It’s been a half hour. Oh wow!
&gt;&gt; Bubbling.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:57.060
&gt;&gt; Oh my god. Those look good! I’ve never
made this before. Wow. Yummy.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.220
&gt;&gt; For real.

00:14:02.479 --> 00:14:10.859
&gt;&gt; Sure smells good. Mm. It tastes just like
apple pie.

00:14:10.859 --> 00:14:17.989
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.
&gt;&gt; Really good. Thanks guys. Alright, Laura!

00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:19.709
Thank you so much for helping me make this
video.

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:23.019
&gt;&gt; You’re welcome.
&gt;&gt; And, until next year, with Laura, at our

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:23.519
baking weekend, that’s it guys, and thanks
so much for using Rachel’s English.
