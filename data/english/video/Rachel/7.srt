00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.470
Rachel: In this American English pronunciation
video, you're going to visit my cousin Brad's

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.460
farm.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.480
You’ll learn reductions like the reduction
of the word them and how 'want to' becomes

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.480
'wanna'.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.010
You'll hear the phrase "a lot of' pronounced
'a lotta'.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.220
And you'll hear an example of the reduction
of because and you are.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.999
Rachel: So Brad, how often do you feed 'em?

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.010
Brad: Twice a day.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.640
Sorry about the wind here, guys.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.050
Here was our first reduction.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.460
Did you hear it?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.370
The reduction of THEM.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.079
It’s really common to drop the TH in this
word and change the vowel to the schwa.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.950
When you do this reduction, make sure you
link it on to the word before.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.579
There should be no break between words.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.180
“Feed them” becomes “feed ‘em”,
feed 'em in conversational English.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.280
Feed ‘em.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.880
It’s like an unstressed syllable at the
end of “feed”.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.820
Rachel: So Brad, how often do you feed 'em?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.659
So Brad, how often do you feed 'em?

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.120
So Brad, how often do you feed 'em?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.280
Brad: Twice a day.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.660
Twice a day.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.420
Let’s look at this short sentence to study
stress.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.320
Do you notice that some words are longer and
some are shorter?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.830
They’re all one-syllable long, but “twice”
and “day” are much longer than “a”.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.520
They have an up-down intonation: Day, day.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.980
“A” is flat and said very quickly.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.640
It's unstressed.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.680
The other two words are stressed.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.409
This contrast between stressed and unstressed
is important in American English.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.900
If everything was stressed and longer, it
would sound more like this: twice a day.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.580
Twice a day.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.480
That’s not normal English.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.440
Twice a day.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.680
Brad: Twice a day.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.400
Twice a day.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.060
Twice a day.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.500
Have you ever seen a cockfight Brad?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.880
Brad: No, I don't want to.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.300
Do they have 'em around here?

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.520
Did you hear another “them” reduction
in that small conversation?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520
Listen again.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.950
Do they have 'em around here?

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.460
Do they have ‘em around here?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.000
Here the word ‘them’ refers to “cockfights”.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.860
It's the plural pronoun and it's pronounced
“em”.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.320
Linked to the word before, it sounds like
“have ‘em, have ‘em”.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.520
Do they have 'em around here?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.630
Do they have 'em around here?

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.960
Do they have 'em around here?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.480
Yeah! a lot of guys from Washburn got arrested
a couple of years ago for big cockfight ring.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.800
Big, big betting?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.320
Yeah.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.540
Rachel: So you guys had a lot of rain you were
saying?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.640
Here was another reduction: of.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.110
A lotta rain.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.160
The phrase “a lot of” is common in American
English, and it’s common to change the word

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.320
“of” to “uh”, a lotta.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.220
Notice what happens to the T: it changes to
a Flap sound because it comes between two

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.500
vowels.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.780
That helps link the two words together.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.340
A lotta.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.870
Only “lot” is stressed here, the two other words are unstressed.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.680
Uh uh uhlotta, uhlotta.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.000
Try that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.040
A lotta.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.080
Rachel: So you guys had a lotta rain you were
saying?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.620
So you guys had a lotta rain you were saying?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.260
So you guys had a lotta rain you were saying?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.520
Oh, it's been terrible!

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.840
Brad: You wanna play with 'em?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.840
This wind is making it a little hard to hear,
but did you hear what my cousin said?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.320
Brad: You wanna play with 'em?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.840
You wanna play with 'em?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.600
You wanna play with ‘em?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.760
There’s the “them” reduction again,
referring to the chickens.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.900
With ‘em, with ‘em, with ‘em.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.900
He also reduced “want to” to “wanna”.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.380
This is really common, Americans do it all
the time in spoken English.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.800
It’s not improper English.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.810
You wanna play with ‘em?

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.230
Brad: You wanna play with ‘em?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.650
You wanna play with ‘em?

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.070
You wanna play with ‘em?

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.070
Rachel: No I'd..

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.600
Brad: Okay, you can grab ‘em out of there
and play with 'em.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.280
Rachel: You can grab ‘em out of there.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.300
Another them reduction!

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.000
Grab ‘em, grab ‘em.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.900
Brad: You can grab ‘em out, You can grab
‘em out, You can grab ‘em out of there and play with 'em if you want.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.180
Rachel: No, I do not wanna hold one of those.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.660
I just used the “wanna” reduction.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.760
Did you hear it?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.380
I do not wanna hold, I do not wanna hold,
I do not wanna hold one of those.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.040
Rachel: It's huge!

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.660
How much does that cow weigh?

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.940
About 1400 pounds.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.180
Rachel: Wow, 1400.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.940
Weigh.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.220
This is a homophone.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.820
That means it sounds exactly the same as another
word.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.350
Do you know what word is?

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.620
“Weigh” is pronounced just like “way”. Way.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.820
Different word, different meaning, different
spelling, but same pronunciation.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.620
We have a lot of homophones in American English.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.260
Click here to see a video I made about homophones.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.840
Rachel: It's huge!

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.660
How much does that cow weigh?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.840
About 1400 pounds.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.080
Rachel: Wow, 1400.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.160
Yeah,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.340
Rachel: Hey Ian.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.120
Ian: Hey.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.160
(laughing)

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.640
Rachel: No, that's not how you said it.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.440
You said "I sold 3 of 'em."

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.940
I sold 3 of 'em before we went into winter.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.180
Because I knew I was gonna be short on feed.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.420
Here, my cousin is talking about his cows,
and I made him say it again so I could get

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.820
it on camera.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.340
Do you hear the THEM reduction?

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.340
I sold 3 of 'em

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.340
Three of ‘em.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.420
Three of ‘em.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.760
Try that.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760
Three of ‘em.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.760
I sold 3 of 'em.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.840
I sold 3 of 'em.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.160
I sold 3 of 'em before we went into winter.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.020
Because I knew I was gonna be short on feed.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.740
Good job.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.120
Rachel: I don't think I was meant to be a
farmer.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.520
You wanna feed 'em Ian?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.120
You just heard two reductions that we’ve
already learned in this video.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.620
What are they?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.020
Rachel: You wanna feed 'em Ian?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.880
You wanna feed 'em Ian?

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.280
“Wanna” and “em”.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.440
Do you want to feed them.?

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.790
You wanna feed 'em?

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.120
I dropped the word DO, turned “want to”
into “wanna”, and used the “them”

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.640
reduction.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.400
You wanna feed ‘em, Ian?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.040
Ian is my brother.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.110
Rachel: You wanna feed 'em Ian?

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.150
You wanna feed 'em Ian?

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.660
You wanna feed 'em Ian?

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.040
Cows spend lot of time in there.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.860
Rachel: Who?

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.560
The cows do.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.400
Rachel: Oh, uhuh.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.480
Rachel's Dad: Do you uh, keep 'em in there
during the winter?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.480
My Dad made the “them” reduction too!

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.490
Did you hear it?

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.890
Rachel's Dad: Do you uh, keep 'em in there
during the winter?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.390
keep 'em in there during the winter?

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.100
keep 'em in there during the winter?

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.340
Keep ‘em in there.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.880
Keep ‘em, keep ‘em, just add that unstressed
syllable to the end of the word before.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.000
Keep 'em.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.340
My dad also dropped the T in “winter”. It became 'winner'.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.620
Did you notice that?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.770
Rachel's Dad: keep 'em in there during the
winter? during the winter? during the winter?

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.000
keep 'em in there during the winter?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Actually, I noticed my cousin Brad did this
earlier too.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.640
Did you notice?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.020
Winter became winner.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.880
Brad: Before we went in to winter.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.389
Before we went in to winter.

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.140
Before we went in to winter.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:22.820
Americans sometimes drop the T when it comes
after an N. “Winter” sounds like ”winner”.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:30.140
Other common examples of this: center, interview,
international, internet.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.660
Rachel's Dad: keep 'em in there during the
winter or do they still go out somewhere?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.000
Brad: They go outside.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.380
They, they're actually outside even when it's
snowing.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.300
Because when I come to feed 'em, they have snow
on their backs.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.120
Rachel's Dad: Oh.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.400
Because when I come to feed ‘em.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.820
THEM reduction, also, my cousin Brad reduced
“because”.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.370
It became “cuz”, cuz,.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.280
Cuz when I. Cuz when I.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.480
Brad: Cuz when I come to feed 'em, Cuz when
I come to feed 'emCuz when I come to feed

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.400
'em, they have snow on their backs.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.220
Rachel's Dad: Oh.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.620
Rachel: Brad thanks for showing me your farm.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.560
Brad: You're welcome!

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.720
You’re welcome.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.020
This is a really common phrase.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.699
We don’t say “you are”, you are welcome.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.340
we don’t generally say “you’re” fully
pronounced, but we reduce it.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.120
Yer, yer.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.700
You’re welcome.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.560
You’re welcome.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.680
Brad: You're welcome!

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.720
You're welcome!

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.760
You're welcome!

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.500
You studied a lot of reductions today.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:40.100
Reductions are a part of natural spoken English,
but I don’t recommend using them in writing.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.620
It’s not professional.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.870
But please, please, use them when you speak.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.340
It will sound great!

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.240
Did you like learning this way?

That's it and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.000
Great, thank you.
