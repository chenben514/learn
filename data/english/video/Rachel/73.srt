00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.689
As it's almost Thanksgiving, today I'm going
to show you how to make one of my favorite

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.690
Thanksgiving treats. And that is a pumpkin
pie, which we're going to make from scratch.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.690
Of course, we'll also learn some about American
English pronunciation.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.500
First, we pick out the pumpkin. 
&gt;&gt;What do you think of this one?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.640
What do you think of this one? There's a lot

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.780
of reduction and linking happening in this
phrase. The T in the word 'what' is generally

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.780
pronounced as a stop, not released. However,
the next word is 'do', which begins with a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.319
D sound. That's the same position as the T.
So in this particular case, rather than having

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:59.420
a stop T go into a D, it's even more casual
and the T is dropped altogether. What do you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.660
think? Wha-duh-yuh, wha-duh-yuh. This is a
common way to pronounce the word 'what' and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.770
'do'. What do you think? What do you like?
What do you mean? ... for example. And you've

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.360
probably noticed that in the word 'do', the
oo vowel is reduced to the schwa. This is

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.620
the same as in the word 'you': the vowel is
reduced to the schwa. Wha-duh-yuh, wha-duh-yuh,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.840
wha-duh-yuh. So those three unaccented words
are all linked together, low in pitch, very

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.380
smooth. Wha-duh-yuh, wha-duh-yuh, What do
you think? So the word 'think' is stressed,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.580
none of the sounds reduce here. But the next
word, 'of', I pronounce this with only the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.580
schwa sound. So I reduce it so much that the
vv, V sound is dropped altogether. What do

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.560
you think of this one? So the word 'of' is
simply pronounce uh, uh, uh, uh-this one,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.280
uh-this one. What do you think of this one?
Listen again.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
&gt;&gt;What do you think of this one?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.269
With the sugar pumpkin purchased: 
&gt;&gt;The first step is to cut the pumpkin in half.

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:22.879
It's kind of hard to cut, if I remember correctly.
It's very firm. // This is my friend Laura. I

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:30.939
spent the weekend with her in Massachusetts
and we did lots of baking. &gt;&gt;Oo, beautiful.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:37.939
Next, pull out the pulp and the seeds. &gt;&gt;Ok,
you know what? I'm just going to go with the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.849
hands. Much easier. // While we were in the kitchen,
we looked out the window and noticed the first

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.450
snow of the season was beginning. &gt;&gt;If you'll
notice, we made some apple bran muffins to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.810
tide us over while we're baking, along with
some homemade apple butter. Did you notice?

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.989
I used the idiom 'tide us over'. This means
to have a small amount of something for a

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.469
short period of time until the issue can be
addressed in a larger way. For example, I

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:17.930
had a small snack to tide me over until dinner.
He borrowed some money to tide him over until

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.810
his next paycheck. I picked up a few things
to tide us over until the weekend when we

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.609
can really go shopping. Listen again. &gt;&gt; We
made some apple bran muffins to tide us over

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.069
while we're baking, along with some homemade
apple butter. So that's going to be delicious,

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.779
and we're going to eat that while the pumpkin
roasts. So now, we've put our two emptied-out

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:47.450
halves on the baking pan, and we're going
to put it in the oven at 350 [degrees Fahrenheit]

00:03:47.450 --> 00:04:01.389
for about an hour, hour and a half. Let's
set the timer. Let's dig into these.

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:08.010
Here I used the idiom to dig into something. This
means to start eating, especially something

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.440
you're excited about. Eating with enthusiasm.
Let's dig into these. Listen again.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.440
&gt;&gt;Let's dig into these. 
&gt;&gt;Mark, what are you doing?

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.990
&gt;&gt;I am going to roast some pumpkin seeds,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.940
which you guys extracted from the whole pumpkin.
&gt;&gt;Which is now out of the oven and cooling.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.940
&gt;&gt;Put some seasoning salt, put a little cayenne
pepper, not too much. What else? Kinda just

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.840
eyeballing this here. Kinda just eyeballing
this here. Mark used the idiom to eyeball

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.430
something. That means he's not measuring.
He's just guessing the amounts of the spices

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.520
as he adds them to the seeds. Kinda just eyeballing
this here. &gt;&gt;What else? Kinda just eyeballing

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.680
this here. So when you scoop the seeds out
of the pumpkin, save them. Rinse them well

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.979
and separate them from the stringy orange
part of the pumpkin. Let them air dry some,

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:13.740
and add some oil. Mark recommends using a
lot of salt. He also adds paprika, chili pepper,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.150
and other spices to taste. Then put them in
the oven. When they start popping, they're

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:27.729
ready to be taken out. &gt;&gt;Oh, I heard that.
&gt;&gt;I heard it too. Oh! &gt;&gt;They're popping, indeed,

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.699
so, we can take them out. Did you notice,
Mark reduced the word 'them' to the schwa

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:42.919
and the M sound: uhm, uhm, take 'em, take
'em out. This is a common way to reduce the

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:50.830
word 'them' in everyday speech. Take 'em out,
bring 'em here, give 'em water, for example.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.610
Also notice Mark makes a stop T on the word
'out'. He does not release it: out. He simply

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.830
brings his tongue into position for the T,
out, cutting off the sound. Take 'em out.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:13.120
Listen again. &gt;&gt;They're popping indeed, so,
we can take them out. &gt;&gt;Yum, those look great.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:22.740
Try one. Yum. &gt;&gt;Crunch? &gt;&gt;Mm, mm-hmm. Really
delicious. What do you think chef, are you

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.530
happy? &gt;&gt;Pretty happy. // Back to the pumpkin.
Once it's cooled, separate the skin from the

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.000
rest of the pumpkin. The skin does not go
into the pie.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.500
Now Laura is going to puree
the pumpkin with an immersion blender.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.150
&gt;&gt;Now we're going to put in some 
sugar, egg, evaporated

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:57.979
milk, some spices. For the full recipe, see
the description on YouTube under the video,

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:04.979
or, see the link on my website. Now Laura
has loaded up the food processor... &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:13.680
&gt;&gt;...with all the ingredients for our homemade
pie crust. &gt;&gt;And now, we roll out the crust.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.759
&gt;&gt;What's that you have under the crust? I
have a little plastic wrap underneath it so

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:22.740
that when it's time to transfer it, you just
scoop it up and turn it over and pull the

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.000
plastic off. &gt;&gt;I'm pretty serious about my
pies, it's true. I like a good pie.

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:40.069
Ok, I think we're almost ready. And now, now normally,
you can use a pie pan, we're using a skillet,

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:44.949
a cast-iron skillet, and I've found it makes
a really nice -- nicely done crust. It's not

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:51.000
at all soggy on the bottom. Fast forward,
shaping the crust in the dish.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.509
And now, we pour it in. 
&gt;&gt;How far up should I go?

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:04.009
&gt;&gt;I think put all of it in. 
&gt;&gt;It's gonna be too much.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:15.169
It's gonna be too much. Did you notice
that Laura said 'gonna' instead of going to.

00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:22.409
It's gonna be too much. &gt;&gt;It's gonna be too
much. Oh my gosh, it's gonna fit. All of it

00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:30.560
is going to fit. That's one whole pumpkin,
folks. &gt;&gt;We've determined the pie is done.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:44.740
So, she comes out of the oven. Now she's nice
and puffy, but this will collapse as it cools.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:51.000
Let the pie cool for several hours. &gt;&gt;And
here is the finished product. Unfortunately

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.120
I have to show it to you by candle light because,
if you'll remember, that snow that we were

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:04.670
so excited about: we've gotten maybe 6 inches,
maybe more, and the power's out. It's been

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:11.750
out for a couple of hours. I expect it will
be out for the entire night. So, in the low

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:26.190
light, let's go ahead and cut the pie. Oh
yeah. So, mm, man, I've got to say, I'm pretty

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:35.839
excited about this. I've gotta say. The words
'I have got to' can reduce to 'I've gotta'

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:44.310
or even simply 'I gotta' in everyday conversation.
I gotta go, I gotta say, I gotta see that

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:51.310
... for example. Man, I've gotta say, I'm pretty
excited about this.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:02.000
Mm-hmm. It's really good.
Guten appetit!
