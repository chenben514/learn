00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.359
In this American English pronunciation video,
you're going to meet my parents.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.820
Now, I've been spending a lot of time teaching
you English, and I thought it would be fun

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.820
to show you who taught me English. These are
my parents Rita and Stan.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.000
Rita. Notice we have a flap T there, because
the T is coming between two vowel sounds.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.300
-ta, -ta, Rita. Stan. Now here we have the
AA as in BAT vowel followed by the N consonant.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.320
When this vowel is followed by the N or the
M consonant, we get an extra sound. Aa-uu,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:59.990
uu, an uh-like sound before the nasal consonant.
Stan, Stan, Stan.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.110
These are my parents Rita and Stan.
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.720
&gt;&gt; So guys, do you remember what my first
word was?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.700
&gt;&gt; I remember your brother's first word.
&gt;&gt; Ok. So, I'm the youngest of two. Clearly

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.600
I'm not a memorable child because the first
one is the more interesting one.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.159
&gt;&gt; His first word was 'hi'.
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.400
&gt;&gt; And, I don't remember Rachel's first word,
but once she started speaking, she never stopped.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.030
&gt;&gt; That's true.
&gt;&gt; So you don't remember my first word either?

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.479
&gt;&gt; It was probably 'mama'.
&gt;&gt; But you don't actually know.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630
&gt;&gt; I don't actually know.
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:50.009
The pronunciation of this word is four syllables,
and with the CH consonant sound. Actually.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.810
But I notice both my Mom and I here pronounced
it actually. We're reducing the word by substituting

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.220
the CH with a SH sound, that has no stop; we're
making it a little bit smoother. And we're

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.200
dropping the schwa syllable altogether. Actually.
Actually.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.269
&gt;&gt; But you don't actually know.
&gt;&gt; I don't actually know.  &gt;&gt; Ok.

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.640
&gt;&gt; They're trying to think of something cute
that I might have said to tell you guys. But

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.709
my Mom said:
&gt;&gt; I can think of something cute your brother

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.640
said.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. See? It's terrible.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.590
&gt;&gt; Well, I remember doing lots of things with
you.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.370
&gt;&gt; Right. No, it's fine.
&gt;&gt; I remember riding you to school on the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.640
handlebars of my bike.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That hurt. I always wished that he

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.190
would buy an actual seat to put on the bike.
&gt;&gt; One thing I remember is sending off a card

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.090
three days before she left for summer camp
so she would receive a card on the first day

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.410
of summer camp.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That was nice. I used to go away

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.410
for two weeks, and Mom was very good about
sending cards and also treats.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.260
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks Mom and Dad so much for being
willing to meet my Rachel's English audience.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.900
One last thing I want to say about them is
tomorrow is their 45th wedding anniversary.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.900
So, happy anniversary, guys!
&gt;&gt; Thank you!

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.629
&gt;&gt; Are you ok?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:24.629
&gt;&gt; This is my favorite uncle John. This is
my dad's older brother. Isn't he cute? John,

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:31.349
this is Rachel's English.
&gt;&gt; Hi Rachel's English. How are you? Rachel

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.060
comes from a very talkative family.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We, we all talk a lot.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It makes sense that I'm doing what I'm

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.379
doing.
&gt;&gt; Right. I'm the quietest one I think.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably. And he's not that quiet.
