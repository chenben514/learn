00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.530
This video comes to you from Dillon, Colorado,
where I'm spending Christmas with my family.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.680
I'm going to introduce you to my cousin and
my cousin's husband. Do you notice anything

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.680
interesting about how those words are pronounced?
If not, stay tuned.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.919
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Rachel's cousin Nikki.
&gt;&gt; I'm Rachel's cousin's husband, Steve.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.260
&gt;&gt; Did you notice how they pronounced the
words 'cousin' and 'husband'? Listen again.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.109
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Rachel's cousin Nikki.
&gt;&gt; I'm Rachel's cousin's husband, Steve.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.920
Did you notice how they pronounced the S as
a Z sound? This is actually quite common in

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.039
American English. I've done a video on how
to pronounce plural nouns. There are many

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.249
cases there where the final S will be pronounced
as a final Z. The same rules apply to third

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:06.850
person verb conjugations. But in the words
'cousin' and 'husband', they're not plural

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.980
nouns, and they're not third person verb conjugations.
They're simply words where the S is pronounced

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.500
as a Z. Unfortunately, there are no rules
to tell you why the S is pronounced as a Z.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.690
But there are a whole slew of words where
this is the case, and they just have to be

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.350
memorized.
Two days ago, my cousin's husband Steve took

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.840
me snowboarding. Unfortunately, because I'm
not very good at it, I fell many times. And

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.010
I've ended up with a huge bruise on my knee.
Both knees, actually. Did you notice? Because,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.880
with a Z. But also, did you notice, bruise.
Spelled with an S, pronounced with a Z.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.220
&gt;&gt; Don't believe her, she did an excellent
job. Do believe her about the bruise, though.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.480
&gt;&gt; Yes, the bruise is, is not a lie.
Other words where the S is pronounced as a

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:09.670
Z: is, his, use. Now, let's stop for a minute
and talk about use. In verb form, the S in

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.540
'use' is pronounced as a Z. But when it's
a noun, use, it's pronounced as an S. So that's

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.160
one way you can differentiate between which
form of the word is being used. This also

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.440
applies to a few other words, for example,
house. As a noun it is an S, and as a verb,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:39.480
house, it is a Z. Was, design, lose. These
are just some of the many words where the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.780
S will be pronounced as a Z. Special thanks
to my cousin and her husband for being in

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.590
this video with me. That's it, and thanks
so much for using Rachel's English.
