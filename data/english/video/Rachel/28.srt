00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.259
In this American English pronunciation video,
we’ll study pronunciation in real life English

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.889
while hanging out at a nature reserve in Florida.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.560
First, we chatted with a ranger.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.689
&gt;&gt; We, we came … he’s never … some of
these people have never seen a gator before.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.330
Here’s an example of a dropping the H reduction.
Instead of ‘people have’, I said ‘people

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.250
uv’, dropping the H and reducing the AA
vowel to the schwa. Now ‘have’ just sounds

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:44.460
like a third, unstressed syllable at the end
of ‘people’, ‘people ov’. People – luv.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.590
Try that with me. People have, people have.
Listen again.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.680
&gt;&gt; We, we came … he’s never …
some of these people have never [3x]

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.210
… seen a gator before.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.800
Instead of saying ‘alligator’, I’m just
saying ‘gator’. I think that’s more

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.409
common in my hometown than it is in most other
places.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.510
&gt;&gt; Is that right? Yeah. Well, you’ll see
some right, you know, right on this side of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.710
the trail.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Good. Because we want to give them

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.950
a good scare.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.920
Good. We have two O’s here, and sometimes
non-native speakers make that sound more like

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:29.350
the OO as in BOO vowel, oo. But this is the
UH vowel, like in ‘push’, uh, or ‘should’.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.130
Uh, uh. Listen again.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.530
&gt;&gt; Good. Because we want to give them a good
scare.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.460
&gt;&gt; Don’t get too close.
&gt;&gt; No, we won’t. Thank you.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.790
Don’t get too close, I won’t. Don’t,
won’t. I’ve made a couple of videos on

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:58.240
these n’t contractions. Notice the T is
not released. It’s not won’t, but won’t.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.030
With a stopped N sound, won’t, won’t,
nt, nt. Don’t. Try it yourself. Don’t,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.670
won’t. Make all of your N’T contractions
this way: didn’t, can’t, shouldn’t.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.460
Listen again.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.330
&gt;&gt; Don’t get too close.
&gt;&gt; No, we won’t. Thank you.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.530
&gt;&gt; What do you guys think of that?

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.820
Whaduhyuh. Here I’m taking ‘what’, ‘do’,
‘you’, and linking them together and smoothing

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.970
them out. What do you guys think of that?
We use the phrase ‘what do you think?’

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.250
a lot. How should you reduce and link these
words? Rather than making a T and a D, just

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.180
make one sound, a Flap T, which sounds just
like the D between vowels. What do, what do,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.290
what do. Just bounce the tongue against the
roof of the mouth without stopping the air.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.260
For both ‘do’ and ‘you’, reduce the
OO as in BOO vowel to the schwa: it’s faster,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.010
simpler; those are both common reductions.
What do you, what do you. Try it, what do

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.050
you. Listen again.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.379
&gt;&gt; What do you guys think of that? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.670
&gt;&gt; He’s huge.
&gt;&gt; Prehistoric.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.099
&gt;&gt; God.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.450
&gt;&gt; Can you see the gators?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.590
Can you. Here I’ve reduced ‘you’ again,
yuh, with the schwa. I’ve also reduced ‘can’.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.319
We do this all the time when it’s a helping
verb, and it’s almost always a helping verb.

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.600
This means it’s not the main verb in the
sentence.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.100
&gt;&gt; Can you see the gators?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.670
‘See’ was the main verb, and ‘can’
a helping verb. Since the N is a syllabic

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.370
consonant, it overtakes the vowel, the schwa.
You don’t need to worry about making it.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:09.840
So just make a K sound and an N sound, kn,
very fast. Can you. Try it, can you, can you.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.050
Listen again.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:20.720
&gt;&gt; Can you see the gators? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.390
&gt;&gt; So, it’s February, and winter is the
best time to come see the gators.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.540
&gt;&gt; Yes. Especially on a sunny day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.120
&gt;&gt; Because they like to come out and soak
up the rays on the bank.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.740
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.
&gt;&gt; We’ll probably pass at least 100 on this

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.900
short walk, I would say.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.720
We’ll probably pass. I reduced ‘we will’
to this contraction. This contraction can

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.139
be pronounced a couple of different ways.
We’ll. Then it sounds like ‘wheel’.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.240
This is the most full and complete pronunciation,
so it’s not the most common. Americans like

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.280
to reduce function words like this. It can
also sound like ‘will’. Or, it can sound

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.520
like we’ll, a very quick version of this
word, wool. We’ll,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.030
we’ll, we’ll. I said it like ‘will’.
Listen again.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.320
&gt;&gt; We’ll probably pass [3x]
at least 100 on this short walk, I would say.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.850
Did you notice the ‘probably’ reduction
to two syllables? Probly. Try it. Probly. [2x]

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.820
Listen again.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.620
&gt;&gt; We’ll probably pass [3x]
at least 100 on this short walk, I would say.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.880
&gt;&gt; I would not be surprised.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, let’s keep walking and see

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.930
what all we see.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:49.150
Keep walkin’. I changed the NG sound to
an N sound. Walkin’ instead of walking.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.540
In general, this reduction is not part of
the standard accent,. It’s a stronger habit

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.560
in certain regional dialects, for example
the south, which is where I am in this video,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.370
and where I grew up. Normally I tell my students
not to do it, because if you do it too much,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.330
it does start to sound like a regional dialect
and not the standard accent. Listen again.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:19.579
&gt;&gt; Well, let’s keep walking and see what
all we see. [3x]

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:26.020
What all. Earlier, we used a Flap T to link
‘what do’, whaduh. Here I used one to

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.690
link ‘what’ and ‘all’. When a word
ends in a T (not part of a cluster), and the

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.639
next word begins with a vowel or diphthong,
make a Flap T to link the words. Instead of

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.460
‘what all’, it becomes ‘wha-dall’.
The tongue just flaps once against the roof

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.250
of the mouth, what all, what all, and it connects
those two words. Linking with a Flap T is

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.509
a great way to smooth out your speech. Listen
again.

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:01.509
&gt;&gt; Well, let’s keep walking and see what
all we see. [3x]

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:02.509
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You’re supposed to—I’ve heard different 
theories about what you’re supposed to do.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:24.460
You’re supposed to. What am I saying here?
You are supposed to. You are, contracted,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:33.199
reduces to you’re, you’re. Very fast.
You’re, you’re. Try it. You’re.

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:39.290
Supposed to. I changed a couple of things
here. I dropped the schwa to squeeze the first

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:45.130
and second syllables together into just one
syllable, supposed to, that begins with the

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:51.460
SP cluster, sp. It’s not uncommon to drop
the T and D sounds when they come between

00:07:51.460 --> 00:08:01.430
two other consonant sounds. So I didn’t
say zdt , z-d-t. I dropped the D. Then, because

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:08.930
the next sound is unvoiced, I made the Z unvoiced.
That makes it an S. Supposed to, supposed

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:15.030
to. The final part of the reduction is changing
the ‘oo’ vowel to the schwa in ‘to’.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:21.270
Very common. It’s okay if you don’t understand
all the reasons why I made every reduction.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:27.560
Just know that this is a common way to reduce
‘supposed to’. Supposed to. Try it with

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.830
me. Supposed to. Listen again.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:43.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You’re supposed to—I’ve heard different 
theories about what you’re supposed to do. [3x]

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.749
In the next section of conversation, listen
for contractions with ‘they’. How many

00:08:47.749 --> 00:08:51.919
are there? Then you’ll see the section again
with the answers on-screen.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:57.749
&gt;&gt; …If one starts going after you. I’ve
heard, run in a zig-zag, because they’ll

00:08:57.749 --> 00:09:00.709
try to follow your zig-zag pattern and they’re
not good at running in zig-zag.

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:03.659
&gt;&gt; I don’t know. That sounds reasonable
to me.

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:06.369
&gt;&gt; But why would they follow your zig-zag
pattern?

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:11.609
&gt;&gt; Because they’re stupid. These are small-brained
animals.

00:09:11.609 --> 00:09:17.579
&gt;&gt; So, they’re very similar to snakes, right?
&gt;&gt; I have no idea.

00:09:17.579 --> 00:09:22.180
&gt;&gt; Evolutionarily? They’re reptiles?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:36.339
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think they’re pretty primitive.

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:41.269
&gt;&gt; …If one starts going after you. I’ve
heard, run in a zig-zag, because they’ll

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:44.259
try to follow your zig-zag pattern and they’re
not good at running in zig-zag.

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:47.160
&gt;&gt; I don’t know. That sounds reasonable
to me.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.910
&gt;&gt; But why would they follow your zig-zag
pattern?

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:55.660
&gt;&gt; Because they’re stupid. These are small-brained
animals.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.130
&gt;&gt; So, they’re very similar to snakes, right?
&gt;&gt; I have no idea.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.730
&gt;&gt; Evolutionarily? They’re reptiles?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.009
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think they’re pretty primitive.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.300
&gt;&gt; What do you see up there, Dad?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.769
Another ‘what do you’ reduction. What
do you see? This time was even more sloppy.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:22.120
Whuh-du-see, not even a clear ‘you’ reduction.
Listen again.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.989
&gt;&gt; What do you see up there, Dad? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Well, I was hoping to spot cranes

00:10:28.989 --> 00:10:36.319
Hopin’ to (duh). My dad also dropped the
G in ING to make –in’ instead. Hoping

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:42.839
to. The word ‘to’ was reduced to the Flap
T and schwa. Here, the tongue is already at

00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:47.899
the roof of the mouth for the N. So you don’t
actually have to flap your tongue. Think of

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:56.049
it as a quick D as you release the N. Hopin’
to. Hopin’ to. Listen again.

00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:58.529
&gt;&gt; Well,
I was hoping to [3x]

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:03.319
…spot cranes. But I do not see any.

00:11:03.319 --> 00:11:04.379
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; From miles away.

00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:07.309
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah?
&gt;&gt; You can hear them before you can see them.

00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:13.759
Dad did two ‘them’ reductions, where we
drop the TH and change the vowel to the schwa.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:20.489
Hear them, see them. Notice notice how ‘them’
links to the word before so it just sounds

00:11:20.489 --> 00:11:25.509
like an unstressed syllable on the end of
that word. It doesn’t feel like a separate

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:32.879
word. That’s what you want, words linked
together. Hear them, see them. Try it with

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:38.779
me. Hear them. See them. Listen again.

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:43.889
&gt;&gt; hear them before you can see them. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah?

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.129
&gt;&gt; They’re really noisy.

00:11:46.129 --> 00:11:48.379
&gt;&gt; Hey David?
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:51.100
&gt;&gt; What do you think of my home city so far?

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:57.739
Another ‘whaduhyuh’. Not ‘what do you’,
but ‘whaduhyuh’, ‘whaduhyuh’. Much

00:11:57.739 --> 00:11:58.649
smoother.

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:03.470
&gt;&gt; What do you think of my [3x]
home city so far?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.559
&gt;&gt; It’s pretty great.
&gt;&gt; I like it!

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:12.679
I hope you enjoyed this real English study.
