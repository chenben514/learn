00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.160
Are you ready to fly?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.560
In this week's video, we'll study conversation,
checking in at an airport.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.860
This is a video collaboration with Simple
English Videos, my friends Vicki and Jay.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.470
In this video, we'll study conversation,
checking in at an airport.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.100
A Ben Franklin Exercise.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.380
At the end of the video, there will be a link
to Vicki's video that will go over some of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.350
the specifics of checking in.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.489
Be sure to follow that link to see her video and
subscribe to her channel if you haven't already.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.189
First, let's take a look at the whole scene.

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:42.450
The machine didn't recognize my passport.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.050
I can help. Where are you flying to today?

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.269
-Recife
-Rio

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:53.049
We're flying to Rio and then we have
a connecting flight to Recife.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:54.520
What are you looking for?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.640
My reading glasses.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.829
They're on your head.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.740
I had a bottle of water.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.500
I threw that away.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Why?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.470
You can't take liquids on the plane.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.830
- Are you checking any bags?
- Yes, just one.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.620
- Can you put it on the scale?
- Sure!

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.700
Can you check our bag through the Recife.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.510
No, I can't.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.320
You'll need to pick it up in Rio to go through
customs.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.280
How much time do we have?
How long is our layover?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.300
About two and a half hours.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.990
That's plenty of time.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.130
- Here are your boarding passes.
- Thank you.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.450
Your flight leaves from Gate 19 and boarding
begins at 11:20.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.050
Eleven twenty.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.120
- Have a great trip!
- We will!

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.880
Now, let's take a close look at what we're hearing.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.120
The machine didn't recognize my passport.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.980
Didn't recognize.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.930
Did you notice how Jay pronounced the N apostrophe T contraction 'didn't'?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.920
He didn't release the T. Didn't. But rather,
ending this word with a nasal stop sound.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.460
Didn't. N-n-

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.560
The machine didn't recognize my passport.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.080
Didn't recognize my passport

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080
Didn't recognize

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.110
This is how we pronounce all N apostrophe
T contractions.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.830
N-- Didn't recognize.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.080
I can help.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.640
Did you notice how the word 'can' was reduced?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.340
K, schwa, N sound.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.569
So it sounds like there's no vowel.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.189
Can- can- I can help.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.009
I can help.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.539
This is because 'can' is a helping verb here.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.180
It's not the main verb. The main verb is 'help'.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.080
'Can' is usually a helping verb.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.160
And in these cases, we do reduce it.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.900
I can help.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.620
Where are you flying to today?

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.520
Where are- I reduced the word 'are'
to the schwa R sound, 'ur'.

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.920
Ur- where-ur

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.269
It linked up with the word before: Where-ur.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.519
Where-ur.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.659
Where-ur.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.399
And just sounds like an extra syllable at
the end of 'where'.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.319
Where are you flying to today?

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.319
Where-ur.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:29.179
I pronounced a full OO vowel in the word 'to' but
I reduced the vowel in the word 'today' to the schwa.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.760
Tu- tu- today.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.011
So this syllable was short and this syllable,
'day' was longer.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.239
Today.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.951
What do you notice about the intonation of that question?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.680
Where are you flying to today?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.920
Today.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.900
The pitch went down at the end. But it's a question.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.501
Questions that can't be answered with Yes or
No do go down in pitch at the end,

00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:00.421
just like phrases.

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:05.141
We're flying to Rio and then we have a connecting
flight to Recife.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:09.300
Vicki has pronounced this beautifully in British English.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.659
As you know, this is an American English channel
and that's really where my expertise is.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.400
I'm not going to comment too much on what
Vicki says, except to point out a few differences

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.400
between British English and American English.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.721
What are you looking for?

00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:27.260
My reading glasses.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.620
The first major difference I'll point out
is how she pronounced the phrase 'what are'.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.800
She made a True T here.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.550
And most Americans will make that a Flap T. What-r.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.440
What are you looking for?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.880
I noticed that people who speak British English
tend to make many more True Ts than Americans.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.940
We like to make more Stop Ts and Flap Ts.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.500
What-r.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.440
But Vicki says...

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.140
What are your looking for?

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.200
What do you notice about the intonation of this question?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.800
Looking for?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800
It goes down in pitch at the end.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.640
Because it cannot be answered with Yes or No.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.400
My reading glasses.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.060
No reductions in Jay's short sentence but listen

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.320
to how the sounds and words all flow together.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.100
My reading glasses.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.960
One thought with a swell over the stressed syllable 'read'.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.041
My reading glasses.

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:44.360
All one nice smooth phrase.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.240
My reading glasses.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.420
They're on your head.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.200
I had a bottle of water.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.160
Jay flapped the double T in 'bottle' so that 
it sounded like an American D.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.820
Bottle. Bottle.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.020
Also the word 'water'.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.910
Vicki probably would have said this with True Ts.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.480
Bottle and wat-t-t...True T.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.600
Actually, 'water' is an interesting word because it sounds

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.620
totally different in British English
than it does in American English.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.380
The vowel is different, the pronunciation
of T is different.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.730
And the pronunciation of the last two letters
is different.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.649
I actually have a video on how American pronounce
the word 'water'.

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.029
Check it out!

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.729
I had a bottle of water.

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.049
- I threw that away.
- Why?

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:41.860
Another clear True T from Vicki where an American
probably would have flapped that.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.560
I threw that away.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.280
That-a...

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.680
I threw that away.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.180
But Vicki says...

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.960
I threw that away.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.640
Why?

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.330
Again, up but then down at the end.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.420
Why?

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.060
This is a question that cannot be answered with Yes or No.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.740
Why?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.840
You can't take liquids on the plane.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.440
Are you checking any bags?

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.970
Here, I pronounce the word 'are' more fully
with a vowel.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.321
Are.

00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:18.941
Aaaare.

00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:20.381
I wouldn't have to.

00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:24.199
Even though it's the beginning of the sentence,
I could still reduce it to 'Urr".

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.840
Ur you checking?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.680
But I said 'are'. Are you checking?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.360
Are you checking any bags?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:43.400
Smooth connection across the phrase with the
stressed syllables 'check' and 'bags'.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.800
It's a question.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.040
What do you notice about the intonation?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.670
Are you checking any bags?

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.350
This is a Yes/No question.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.580
So the pitch should go up at the end.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.159
But actually, I made it so the pitch goes down.

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:57.559
Bags.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.140
Are you checking any bags?

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.940
Okay, so the rules aren't perfect.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.700
I also could have said this with intonation
going up at the end.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.540
Are you checking any bags?

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:17.040
And in general, it's more polite to make your
intonation go up at the end of a Yes/No question.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.320
- Are you checking any bags?
- Yes, just one.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.800
Can you put it on the scale?

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.540
Another 'can' reduction.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.710
Kn- kn- Why is that?

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.831
What's the main verb here?

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.830
The main verb is 'put'.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.270
So 'can' is a helping verb. Reduce it.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.860
Can you put it on the scale?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.260
Scale?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.300
The intonation does go up at the end of this
Yes/No question.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.540
Can you put it on the scale?

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.980
I noticed my Flap T is making this little
3-root phrase very smooth.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.800
Puuuttiiiton.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.090
Put it on.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.690
Can you put it on the scale?

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.450
Not True Ts but just flapping the tongue against the mouth

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.060
to make the connection between the words smoother.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.120
Put it on.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:19.380
Can you put it on the scale?

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.880
Sure.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.340
There are a couple different ways to pronounce this word.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.620
I usually say 'sure!'

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.700
Jay said, 'Sure!.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.360
Both are acceptable.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.520
Sure.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.240
Can you check out backs through to Recife?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.380
Notice Jay reduced 'can' to 'kn'.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.720
Can you check our bags?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.540
What's the main verb here?

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.900
Can you check our bags through to Recife?

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:51.400
The main verb is 'check' so 'can' is a helping
verb and we want to reduce that.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.530
The word 'to', Jay pronounced that with a
Flap T and the schwa.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:02.390
This is the common reduction:
Through-da.  Through-da.  Through-da.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.590
Can you check our bags through to Recife?

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.149
Through to Recife?

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:11.709
No, I can't. You'll need to pick it up in Rio to go through customs.

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:12.820
Can't.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.340
I did pronounce a strong True T there, didn't I?

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.040
I was being extra clear.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.520
What do you notice about the vowel in the word 'can't'?

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.800
No, I can't.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.511
It's a full AA vowel.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.540
AA.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:36.480
Even though we reduced the vowel in the word
'can' often, we do not reduce the vowel in

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.540
the word 'can't'.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.670
No, I can't.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.990
You'll need to pick it up in Rio to go through customs.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.530
I reduced the vowel in 'to' to the schwa.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.190
You'll need te-
You'll need te-

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:57.680
You'll need to pick it up in Rio-

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.020
Pick it up.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.520
What do you notice about the T here?

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520
Pick it up.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:09.420
Its a Flap T. It comes between two vowels
so I made that sound like the American D sound.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.630
Pick it up.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.270
You'll need to pick it up in Rio-

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.090
You'll need to pick it up in Rio to go through customs.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.060
Again, I reduced the vowel in 'to'.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.300
Now I could make this T a Flap T, but I didn't.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.740
I made it a True T....in Rio Te ...in Rio Te

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.380
But I could have said 'in Riote'

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.200
You'll need to pick it up in Rio to go through customs.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.960
How much time do we have?
How long is our layover?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.460
What do you notice about the intonation of
these two questions?

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:47.460
After the phrase peaks on the stressed word
'time', 'do we have', the last three words

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.160
are all pretty low in pitch, heading down.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.870
How much time do we have?

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:57.110
Layover. Both of these phrases, questions, but not

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.390
Yes/No questions, go down in pitch.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:09.120
How much time do we have? 
How long is our layover?

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.480
About two and a half hours.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.640
That's plenty of time.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.700
Did you notice the very clear Stop T in 'about'?

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.320
About two and a half hours.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.730
I made it True T for 'two' but I made a Stop T for 'about'.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.220
About, stop the air, two and a half hours.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.079
This is how you'll want to pronounce this
when one word ends in a T and the next word

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.440
begins in a T.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:41.540
About two and a half hours.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.800
Don't make two T sounds.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.700
Just make a stop and then one true T.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:54.780
About two and a half hours.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.030
How did I pronounce the word 'and'?

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.039
I reduced it to just the schwa N sound.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.900
Nn- Two and a half.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.060
Notice the L in 'half' is silent.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.240
About two and a half hours.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.020
That's plenty of time.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.640
Vicki made a nice clear True T here.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:26.020
That's plenty of time.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.840
Americans will often drop the T completely
when it comes after an N.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.140
Actually, we'll see an example of this in
just a minute.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.680
- Here are your boarding passes.
- Thank you.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.080
Here are your boarding passes.

00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:41.019
I did make a full vowel in the word 'are'.

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:44.339
But it was still very fast, very quick.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.580
It's a function word, it doesn't need much time.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.200
Here are your...

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.900
Here are your boarding passes.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.760
Thank you.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.300
Your flight leaves from gate 19 and boarding begins at 11:20.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:08.420
Your flight leaves.. The word 'your' was very fast. I reduced it so that it has the schwa R ending.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.400
Yer.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.860
Yer flight.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.260
Your flight leaves.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.100
Your flight leaves from gate 19 and boarding begins at 11:20.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.880
'Flight leaves' with a clear stop T, not released.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.160
Flight...flight...flight leaves

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.840
Your flight leaves

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.620
Your flight leaves from gate 19 and boarding begins at 11:20.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.040
Eleven twenty.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.680
Here is the example I talked about earlier.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.580
Americans often drop the T when it comes after an N.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.891
'Twenty' is a perfect example.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.180
I did it.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:52.200
Eleven twenty.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.320
And so did Jay.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.100
Eleven twenty.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.100
Twenty.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.100
Eleven twenty.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.180
Have a great trip!

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.170
Great trip.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.309
Again, I did not make two Ts.

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:10.740
One word ended in a T, the next word began
in a T, but I didn't repeat the T.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.220
Great trip.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.680
Have a great trip!

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:23.400
Trip. The TR consonant cluster can be,
and often is pronounced as CHR.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.840
CHRip.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.980
Instead of TRip.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.300
TRip.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.260
Have a great trip.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.150
Let's hear the whole dialogue again.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.899
The machine didn't recognize my passport.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.300
I can help. Where are you flying to today?

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.920
-Rio
-Recife

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:51.340
We're flying to Rio and then we have
a connecting flight to Recife.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.779
-What are you looking for?
-My reading glasses.

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:58.199
They're on your head.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.000
I had a bottle of water.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.930
I threw that away.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:02.690
Why?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.820
You can't take liquids on the plane.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.120
- Are you checking any bags?
- Yes, just one.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.720
- Can you put it on the scale?
- Sure.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.260
Can you check our bags through to Recife?

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.840
No, I can't.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.660
You'll need to pick it up in Rio to go through
customs.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.580
How much time do we have?
How long is our layover?

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.579
About two and a half hours.

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:26.279
That's plenty of time.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.480
- Here are your boarding passes.
- Thank you.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.839
Your flight leaves from Gate 19 and boarding
begins at 11:20.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.220
Eleven twenty.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.740
- Have a great trip!
- We will!

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.940
