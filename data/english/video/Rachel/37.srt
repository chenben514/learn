In this American English pronunciation video,
you’re going to learn how to pronounce the

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.140
word ‘water’.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.320
This video is being made on vacation. So,
the background’s weird, the lighting’s

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.650
weird, but we get the benefit of having lots
of other fun people be in this video so that

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.659
you can better learn American English pronunciation.
We’re going to learn how to pronounce the

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:34.830
word ‘water’. ‘Water’ is especially
interesting because it’s so different in

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.050
American English than it is in British English.
So let’s start. How do we pronounce it?

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.070
The lips will round for the W consonant. Wa-.
Then we have a vowel. It’s a lot more open

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.210
in American English than it is in British
English. I use the AH as in FATHER vowel,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.070
wa-, ah, where my jaw drops quite a bit. The
back part of the tongue presses down a little

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.130
bit. Wa-, ah, wa-. So that’s a very open
sound. Water.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.490
Then we have the letter T. It comes between
two vowels. So, in American English, we’re

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.329
going to make that a Flap T. It will sound
like a D. In British English they don’t

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:25.270
do that. They keep a True ‘tt’ sound.
Water, water. This Flap T sound is the R sound

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.119
in some other languages like Arabic, Spanish,
Portuguese. But, in American English we call

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.130
it a Flap T, and the tongue just bounces up
against the roof of the mouth. Water, -ter,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.139
-ter. So, it’s a quick easy movement and
there’s no stop of air.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:52.499
Then we have the schwa-R sound. In American
English we maintain a real R sound. In British

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:57.700
English, they don’t when it’s at the end
of a word. Water, -er, -er. It’s a very

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.569
closed sound. So to make the sound, the tongue
lifts up and it pulls back a little bit. So,

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.689
the middle part of the tongue is touching:
maybe the roof of the mouth, maybe the teeth,

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.870
rr, rr, while the front has pulled back and
up a little bit, so it’s not touching anything,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.459
rr. We can hold that sound out. The tongue
shouldn’t be flapping, ruh, ruh. That’s

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:30.129
only for the Flap T. Here it holds in place:
water, rr, rr. You can see the lips will round

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.819
a little bit for that final sound as well.
Water.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.430
You don’t need to worry about making a separate
schwa sound. Just go straight from the Flap

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.349
into the R. Water, water. Now we’re going
to see a little bit of video of me walking

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.939
to the well with my family to fill up our
water bottles, and you’re going to hear

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.209
the word ‘water’ lots of times.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.210
&gt;&gt; How, like, old-fashioned are we that we
have to walk to the well to get water?

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.250
&gt;&gt; I know.
&gt;&gt; We’ll here we’re just on our way to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.010
the well to get some water!
&gt;&gt; See, in rural Michigan…

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.760
&gt;&gt; How’s it taste, David?
&gt;&gt; Oh, the water is really good.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.109
&gt;&gt; Jace, how was the water?
&gt;&gt; Cold and good.

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.959
&gt;&gt; How’s the water?
&gt;&gt; ???

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.340
&gt;&gt; That water tastes great.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.999
&gt;&gt; Alright, does everyone have all the water
they need?

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.999
&gt;&gt; I have my water. Let’s go.
&gt;&gt; Wait! One more.

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.779
&gt;&gt; Do you have your water?
&gt;&gt; I got my water.

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.760
&gt;&gt; Jace, do you need more water?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.250
&gt;&gt; Karina, can you way ‘water’?
&gt;&gt; Wa-wa.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.409
&gt;&gt; Say ‘water’ for the camera.
&gt;&gt; Say ‘water’.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.689
&gt;&gt; Wa-wa.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:55.670
&gt;&gt; Water.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.480
