00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:03.161
Happy Thanksgiving everybody!

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.381
I’m here in Pennsylvania at my
boyfriend’s parents’ house.

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.476
And we’re going to celebrate
Thanksgiving tomorrow.

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:12.741
And I know what you’re thinking: “Rachel,
I had no idea you had a boyfriend.”

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.492
It’s true, I’ve been
keeping it secret.

00:00:14.492 --> 00:00:17.474
But in this video, you’re
going to meet my boyfriend,

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:21.206
and you’re also going to have an
American English pronunciation quiz,

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.632
so watch all the way to the
end for the quiz questions.

00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:35.804
Ok guys, are you ready?
This is my boyfriend.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.120
His name is David.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.935
Hey guys.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:41.443
David lives in Philadelphia, which is
about two hours away from New York.

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:43.814
But we’re not in Philadelphia,
we’re at his parents’ house,

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:48.653
which is in a different location
in the state of Pennsylvania.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:51.848
So, to get ready for Thanksgiving,
we’re making four pies tonight.

00:00:51.848 --> 00:00:54.698
So, join in the fun.

00:00:54.723 --> 00:00:56.668
Yeah, we should roll out
the crust probably,

00:00:56.668 --> 00:01:01.621
but let’s go check the temperature
of the apple pie filling.

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:02.956
So, we made the apple pie filling,

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:05.616
and now it needs to cool
before we put it in the pie.

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.370
So we stuck it in the
garage where it’s cooler.

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:12.492
Where’d you put it?

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:13.872
On the floor, I think.

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:15.097
Over in the corner.

00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:16.370
What corner?

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.135
- Back there.
- Oh wow.

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:25.468
Ooo, this is cold on my feet!
Oh, it’s still steamy.

00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:26.548
Alright, well.

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:31.723
Let’s roll out the pie crusts, and maybe
that will have cooled down by then.

00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:34.482
Alright.

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:36.024
We’re going to call that good enough.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.889
So, this is an apple, and we decided

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.219
that we were going to put it in
the ones with the bigger edge.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.349
Here’s one.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.136
Yeah, the pumpkin can
just go where ever.

00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:47.202
How about this? This can go too.

00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:55.541
We’re doing so many ‘can’ reductions:
This can go there, that can go there.

00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:59.603
Alright, we successfully
rolled out the pie crust,

00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:01.460
and now we’re going
to stuff the pies.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.987
That was totally the wrong verb.

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:05.382
We’re going to to fill the pies.

00:02:05.382 --> 00:02:06.322
Stuff the turkey!

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:08.393
- That’s right! They’re in there, right?
- Yep.

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.378
Here, I’ll move this.

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:14.873
Here’s what the apple
pie filling looks like.

00:02:14.873 --> 00:02:17.872
It’s really quite delicious.

00:02:17.872 --> 00:02:19.941
What are you working
on there, Annabelle?

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.492
I’m making the dressing.

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:26.386
I’ve got the toast all
ready, and cutting it up,

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:30.615
and then I’ll add the
onions, celery, and butter.

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:33.296
And you’re actually making
it tomorrow, right?

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:36.999
I’ll make it tonight and
let the seasoning mellow.

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.121
Nice!

00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:42.638
Oops.
That’s flour.

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:48.218
In the mean time, our apple pies came out
of the oven, they’re looking pretty good.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.222
They’re from the 70’s.

00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:52.589
- 70’s, mom?
- I love ’em [THEM reduction!]

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.222
You think they’re from the 70’s, mom?

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:55.595
I think so, yeah.

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:56.823
They’re awesome.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:00.308
Ok. So the oven’s preheated?

00:03:00.308 --> 00:03:02.509
- Yep.
- Alright, let’s do this.

00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:06.471
Where’d I put that recipe? Here.

00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:12.939
Nnnnnnnno.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:13.758
Doesn’t matter.

00:03:13.758 --> 00:03:15.523
Oh, and it’s only
supposed to be at 350?

00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:18.691
So intimidating.

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:25.924
But when it comes out, it’s really worth
it, because it’s Glen’s favorite pie.

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:33.731
Fifteen minutes starts now.

00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.551
Yep, they’re all out.

00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:39.388
And I think they’re going
to be good tomorrow.
