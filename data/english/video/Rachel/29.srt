00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.080
In this American English pronunciation video,
I’m going to discuss, with my Mom, the pronunciation

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.089
of WH.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.340
I’ve gotten a couple questions about how
do you pronounce words that begin with WH.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
And I’ve brought my Mom here because she
pronounces it differently than I do. She does

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.300
the perfect, in my opinion, old fashioned,
hw sound before the W. Whereas, I just make

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.550
a clean W sound. So, for example, let’s
just say some words.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.719
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.059
&gt;&gt; Whale.
&gt;&gt; Whale.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.399
&gt;&gt; White.
&gt;&gt; White.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.739
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.079
&gt;&gt; Why?
&gt;&gt; Why?

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.420
&gt;&gt; While.
&gt;&gt; While.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.960
&gt;&gt; Such a perfect hw. So, either way, totally
acceptable. And Mom, you said sometimes you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.479
leave off the hw? Like for the word ‘whether’,
you said you don’t do it.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.590
&gt;&gt; Whether, W-H-E-T-H-E-R, I would say the
same as weather.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.639
&gt;&gt; Whether or not.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, whether or not, I would say the same

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:13.790
as weather, clouds, rain, sleet.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.619
&gt;&gt; So, there I don’t say the WH.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.880
&gt;&gt; So either one is acceptable. Um, in my
opinion, why learn another sound, hw, when

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.579
you don’t have to. Just make it a nice,
clean W sound. I also think that the way my

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.139
Mom says it, white.
&gt;&gt; White.

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:35.859
&gt;&gt; …is a little old fashioned.  What do 
you think. Do you agree with that?

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.520
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.349
&gt;&gt; I don’t think it’s old-fashioned.
&gt;&gt; What do you think it is?

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:45.149
&gt;&gt; I think it’s the way to say WH.
&gt;&gt; Oh. Its A way to say WH.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.869
Grammar note: when you say THE way, it means
there’s only one way. When you say A way,

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.289
it means there is more than one way. Mom thinks
her way is the only way, the right way,

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.369
but I know that both are acceptable pronunciations.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.460
Listen again to THE way and A way.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.370
&gt;&gt; What do you think it is?
&gt;&gt; I think it’s the way to say WH.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.810
&gt;&gt; Oh. Its A way to say WH.
&gt;&gt; Okay guys, so that’s my opinion on how

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.269
to say WH words. If you’re going to say
it like me, which is a clean W sound, you

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.930
just round the lips, ww, and start your word.
Thanks, Mom.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.939
&gt;&gt; You’re welcome, dear.
&gt;&gt; Alright guys, that’s it, and thanks so

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.939
much for using Rachel’s English.
