00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.220
Hey guys, I’m on my way to take a look at
my wedding venue. You’re going to come along

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.810
and study American English pronunciation in
this real life English video.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.650
In today’s video, we’re going to do a
listening comprehension quiz on two-syllable

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.989
words. Can you identify which syllable is
stressed? Why does it matter? Even if all

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:34.969
of the sounds in a word are correct, one must
speak with long vs. short syllables in order

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.390
to sound American. One of the main things
I work on with advanced students is shortening

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:51.920
short syllables. It has an amazing impact
on reducing their accent. Let’s get started.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.239
&gt;&gt; So, the space that we’re getting married
in used to be a chocolate factory, about a

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.960
century ago.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.329
&gt;&gt; Getting. What syllable is stressed, is
longer? Does it sound like DA-da or da-DA?

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:15.219
Getting, DA-da.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.649
&gt;&gt; The space that we’re getting married
in [3x]

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:31.270
Married. DA-da or da-DA?
Married, DA-da.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.810
&gt;&gt; The space that we’re getting married
in [3x] used to be a chocolate factory.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:47.180
Chocolate. Wait, is this a two-syllable or
a three-syllable word? Choc-late, choc-o-late.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.030
There are many words in English with first
syllable stress that can be pronounced with

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:02.799
either 2 or 3 syllables, I tend to pronounce
them with 2. Chocolate. Other examples: family,

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.669
restaurant. Chocolate, DA-da.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:12.480
&gt;&gt; Used to be a chocolate [3x] factory about
a century ago.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:25.370
About. DA-da or da-DA?
About, da-DA.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.540
&gt;&gt; Used to be a chocolate factory about a
century [3x] ago.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:43.640
Ago. DA-da or da-DA?
Ago, da-DA.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.159
&gt;&gt; Used to be a chocolate factory about a
century ago [3x].

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.099
&gt;&gt; So, the space that we’re getting married
in used to be a chocolate factory, about a

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.540
century ago. And now …

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.090
And now it’s a photography studio, painted
all white with hardwood floors.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:22.560
Painted. DA-da or da-DA?
Painted, DA-da.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.849
&gt;&gt; …painted all [3x] white with hardwood
floors.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:40.590
Hardwood. DA-da or da-DA?
Hardwood, DA-da.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.019
This is a compound word. Most compound words
have stress on the first word. Compound words

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:56.729
are words made by putting two other words
together. Other examples: bedroom, keyboard.

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:03.980
&gt;&gt; With hardwood floors [3x]. It’s a little
industrial, as you can see.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:15.130
Little. DA-da or da-DA?
Little, DA-da.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:23.150
&gt;&gt; It’s a little industrial [3x], as you
can see. Exposed brick up there.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:36.860
Exposed. DA-da or da-DA?
Exposed, da-DA.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.530
&gt;&gt; Exposed brick [3x] up there. Wa—um. Metal
rafters.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:56.040
Metal. DA-da or da-DA?
Metal, DA-da.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.020
&gt;&gt; Wa—um. Metal rafters [3x].

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:16.190
Rafters. DA-da or da-DA?
Rafters, DA-da.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:24.800
&gt;&gt; Metal rafters [3x].

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.690
&gt;&gt; And now it’s a photography studio, painted
all white with hardwood floors. It’s a little

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:45.530
industrial as you can see. Exposed brick up
there. Wa—um. Metal rafters.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:53.960
This used to be the smokestack of the factory.
Smokestack: another compound word. What does

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.150
that mean? Stress is probably on the first
syllable.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.010
Smokestack, DA-da.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:15.220
&gt;&gt; This used to be the smokestack [3x]. And
yeah, this is where we’re going to do it.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.610
Where we’re going to get married.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:29.750
Gonna. DA-da or da-DA?
Gonna, DA-da.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:37.460
&gt;&gt; And yeah. This is where we’re gonna [3x]
do it, where we’re gonna get married.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.980
So we came back today…

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:53.250
Today. DA-da or da-DA?
Today, da-DA.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:02.180
&gt;&gt; So we came back today [3x] so that we could,
sort of, think about decorations and layout.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:15.740
Layout. Another compound word. DA-da or da-DA?
Layout, DA-da.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:23.940
&gt;&gt; …sort of, think about decorations and
layout [3x]. But I’m really excited about

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.290
the space.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:37.800
Really. DA-da or da-DA?
Really, DA-da.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:45.840
&gt;&gt; But I’m really [3x] excited about the
space.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:53.280
&gt;&gt; This used to be the smokestack of the factory.
And, yeah, this is where we’re gonna do

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:00.060
it. Where we’re gonna get married. So we
came back today so that we could, sort of,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.280
think about decorations and layout. But I’m
really excited about the space.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.630
Now it gets harder. You won’t hear the word
on its own, slowly, outside of the sentence.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:19.630
You’ll only hear the word in the sentence.
Can you still tell which syllable is stressed?

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.920
&gt;&gt; I think, I think these tables come with
the space. These high tables.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.390
DA-da.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:38.390
&gt;&gt; I think these tables come with the space.
These high tables. Yeah. Exciting.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:49.310
Another three-syllable word that I’ve turned
into a two-syllable word.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:55.050
&gt;&gt; So, I think the tables are gonna go here.
And the bar is probably going to be somewhere

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.500
else.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.940
DA-da.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:08.940
&gt;&gt; And the bar is probably going to be somewhere
else.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:16.870
&gt;&gt; And the bar is probably going to be somewhere
else.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.810
DA-da.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:27.810
&gt;&gt; Is probably going to be somewhere else.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.230
&gt;&gt; We are having alcohol at our wedding.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:40.570
DA-da. The –ing ending will never be stressed.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.070
&gt;&gt; We are having alcohol at our wedding.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:50.130
&gt;&gt; We are having alcohol at our wedding.  DA-da.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:56.130
&gt;&gt; We are having alcohol at our wedding. Some
people choose not to.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.240
DA-da.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.700
&gt;&gt; Some people choose not to...

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.700
&gt;&gt; although most people do.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.150
da-DA.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:16.870
&gt;&gt; Although most people do. And we’re getting
married, and having the reception all here

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:23.870
in this same space. It used to be really typical
to get married in a church, less so now.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:32.260
&gt;&gt; Most of my cousins have gotten married
outside.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.500
DA-da.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:42.500
&gt;&gt; Most of my cousins have gotten married
outside.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.360
DA-da.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:59.320
&gt;&gt; Most of my cousins have gotten married
outside.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:06.320
DA-da. Outside can actually have stress on
either the first or the second syllable, depending

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.000
on how you’re using it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
&gt;&gt; Most of my cousins have gotten married
outside. A lot of my friends as well. We can’t

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:23.240
do that because it’s going to be January
in Philadelphia.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:30.240
da-DA. I could have reduced this further to
just ‘cuz’.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:36.410
&gt;&gt; We can’t do that because it’s going
to be January in Philadelphia.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:43.410
&gt;&gt; Um, but hopefully this will be just as
lovely!

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.850
DA-da.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:57.529
&gt;&gt; Um, but hopefully this will be just as
lovely! We’re going to have lots of candles.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:01.820
Everywhere, candles, candles, candles.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:08.820
DA-da.  &gt;&gt; We’re going to have lots of candles.
Everywhere, candles, candles, candles. And,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.270
um, the chocolate that used to be made in
this factory.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:21.040
&gt;&gt; It was the precursor to the Hershey’s
kiss.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.820
DA-da.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.850
&gt;&gt; It was the precursor to the Hershey’s
kiss. It’s shaped the same, it’s called

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.530
a Wilburbud.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:36.530
&gt;&gt; And we’re gonna have a lot of those for
our guests to enjoy as well.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.710
da-DA.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.710
&gt;&gt; And we’re gonna have a lot of those for
our guests to enjoy as well.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.710
&gt;&gt; Unless we eat them all before the wedding.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.190
da-DA.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:06.190
&gt;&gt; Unless we eat them all 
before the wedding.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:11.040
da-DA.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:21.940
&gt;&gt; Unless we eat them all before the wedding.
Which might happen.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.420
DA-da.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.010
&gt;&gt; Which might happen.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:34.730
&gt;&gt; Um, we are going to have a full dinner
for our guests.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.959
DA-da.

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:42.380
&gt;&gt; Um, we are going to have a full dinner
for our guests.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.190
&gt;&gt; That’s pretty typical as well.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.430
DA-da.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:54.060
&gt;&gt; That’s pretty typical as well.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:05.180
&gt;&gt; So, I guess I’m curious about, if you’ve
been married before, what was your wedding

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:10.850
like? What was the space like? The venue.
Was it outdoors, indoors, was it in a church?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.160
So let me know in the comments below.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.130
&gt;&gt; So, I guess I’m curious about, if you’ve
been married before, what was your wedding

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:30.800
like? What was the space like? The venue.
Was it outdoors, indoors, was it in a church?

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.190
So let me know in the comments below.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.190
&gt;&gt; The venue. Was it outdoors, indoors, was
it in a church? So let me know in the comments

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.360
below.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:51.529
Let’s review all the words with stress on
the first syllable. DA-da. Getting, married,

00:14:51.529 --> 00:15:04.390
chocolate, painted, hardwood, little, metal,
rafters, smokestack, gonna, layout, really,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:17.250

happen, dinner, pretty, venue, comments, outdoors,
indoors

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:36.130
Now let’s review all the words with stress
on the second syllable. da-DA. About, ago,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:48.290
exposed, today, although, outside, because,
enjoy, unless, before.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:55.290
Many more two-syllable words in English have
stress on the first syllable than the second.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:00.010
Was there anything about the pronunciation
of a word or a phrase in this video that you

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:06.170
found interesting? Next week I’ll release
a bonus video with other topics from this

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.460
trip to the venue!

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:14.230
&gt;&gt; Alright guys, that’s it, and thanks so
much for using Rachel’s English.
