00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.759
In this American English pronunciation video,
we’re going to go over how to introduce

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.710
someone.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.730
First, watch a few introductions. Then, we’ll
talk about what we’re hearing.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.279
&gt;&gt; Hey Staci. Hey.
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.039
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; This is my boyfriend David.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.220
&gt;&gt; Um, hi, David. Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; It’s really nice to meet you.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.610
&gt;&gt; I’m Staci.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is my friend Staci from YouTube.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.129
&gt;&gt; Oh, it’s really nice to meet you. I see.

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.270
&gt;&gt; Hey Hilah, this is my boyfriend David.
&gt;&gt; Hi David. I’m Hilah.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520
&gt;&gt; Hey. Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.430
&gt;&gt; Hilah, I did the program in L. A. with.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.870
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.650
&gt;&gt; This, uh, this will be a boy.
&gt;&gt; Oh! Hi boy!

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.489
&gt;&gt; In November.
&gt;&gt; His name will be Flint.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.940
&gt;&gt; Hi Flint. Really? Aw. Cute!
&gt;&gt; Hi Flint. Nice to meet you.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.990
&gt;&gt; This is our dog Banjo.
&gt;&gt; Hi Banjo. Does Banjo shake?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.809
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.899
You might have noticed we use the phrase ‘this
is.’ Then you can say the name.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.710
This is David, this is Rachel.
It’s also common to say your relationship

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.180
to the person, followed by his or her name.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.570
This is my boyfriend David.
This is my dad, Stan.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.180
This is my colleague, Tom.
This is my friend, Liz.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.820
This is. Stress is on ‘this’. They should
link together. We have an ending consonant

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.939
and a beginning vowel, so we want to link
the consonant to the vowel to connect the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.320
words. This is, this is, this is.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.820
The TH is tough for a lot of students. The
tongue can come through the teeth. But, since

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.950
this is a voiced TH, th instead of th, you
don’t have to bring the tongue tip all the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.229
way out. You can keep the teeth mostly together,
and press your tongue on the backsides of

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.290
the teeth inside the mouth. Thi-, thi-, thi-,
thi-, immediately pulling away. Make sure

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.069
the tongue tip isn’t at the roof of the
mouth, or it will sound like a D. Di-, di-,

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:26.480
dis, dis is, dis is.
Th-, th-, this, this is, this is. Can you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.030
hear the difference?
0:02:58.530,0:02:39.430
This, dis. [3x]

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.830
This is my boyfriend David.
This is my dad, Stan.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.200
This is my colleague, Tom.
This is my friend, Liz.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.890
This is, this is.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.069
&gt;&gt; This is my boyfriend, David,
&gt;&gt; Hi! [3x]

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.519
This is, this is.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.360
&gt;&gt; This is my friend Staci from YouTube. [3x]

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.700
This is, this is.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.409
&gt;&gt; This is my boyfriend, David. [3x]

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.620
This is, this is.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.580
&gt;&gt; This is our dog, Banjo. [3x]

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.939
This is, this is.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.049
&gt;&gt; Hey Hilah, this is my boyfriend David.
&gt;&gt; Hi David. I’m Hilah.

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.629
&gt;&gt; Hey. Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.890
&gt;&gt; Hilah…

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.720
Normally, after being introduced, you say,
“Nice to meet you.” Notice how the T in

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.170
‘meet’ can sound like a CH sound when
the next word is ‘you’. Nice to meet you,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.400
‘chew’, ‘chew’. Nice to meet you.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.730
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; It’s really nice
to meet you. &gt;&gt; I’m Staci. [3x]

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.510
Nice to meet you.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.480
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Hilah… [3x]

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.590
Nice to meet you.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.049
So, the two key phrases for introducing someone:
This is ___. And, if you’ve been introduced,

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.090
Nice to meet you.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.840
