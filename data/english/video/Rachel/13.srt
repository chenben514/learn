00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
In this American English pronunciation video, we'll go for a hike in Colorado.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.860
My dad and I discussed the hike and we'll talk about interesting pronunciations and vocabulary words

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.900
that come up in real English conversation.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.880
This hike is called Chihuahua Gulch.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.140
Chihuahua.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.060
Have you heard this word before? It's a teeny tiny breed of dog.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.800
The spelling is pretty strange in American English because this word comes to us from Spanish.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.020
The breed originated in Mexico.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.480
This hike is called Chihuahua Gulch and it's about seven miles roundtrip.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.980
Roundtrip.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.000
The opposite of this phrase is one way.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.180
So when you go somewhere and come back, that's roundtrip.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.620
Notice how the D is dropped.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200
Roundtrip.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.640
We often drop the D when it comes between two other consonants.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.520
Roundtrip.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.820
Roundtrip.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.420
It's about seven miles roundtrip and it goes up about 1,900 feet.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.580
So this hike ends at a lake?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.180
Yeah. You go… you start off going uphill about thirty minutes, then you go through this long valley.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.000
Notice how my dad really stretches out the word ‘long’.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.760
Why does he do that?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.260
When we want to really stress words, we make them longer,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.660
and you might do that especially with the word ‘long’ making it longer for dramatic purposes.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.440
Long Valley.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.760
That took a long time.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.500
That test was so long.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.960
through this long valley with a lot of gorse and little lakes and—

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.180
Gorse.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.920
Hmm…do you know that word? I didn't either.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.080
Let's find out what it means.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.180
With a lot of gorse and little lakes and little streams.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.180
Gorse.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.020
Gorse are these bushes.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.700
Oh! I didn’t…didn’t know that.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.920
And you sort of go to the end of the trees where the jeep road ends.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.340
Did you understand what he said there?

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.300
He called this road ‘jeep road’.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.140
So a jeep is a really rugged vehicle that has a high clearance.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.800
That is a lot of room between the ground and the bottom of a car.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.540
You would not be able to drive a regular car on this road.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.060
Where the jeep road ends and then it’s just a single path.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.440
And you end up at a mountain lake.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.620
And you said that mountain lake: "Eh, if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all."

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.520
You've seen one. You seen them all.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.880
This is a phrase you might use to say that something isn't special.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.220
Now the full grammatically correct pronunciation of this phrase would be

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.340
‘If you've seen one, you've seen them all.’

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.380
but that's not how we pronounce it.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.120
We like to reduce things in American English

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.900
especially familiar words and phrases

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.680
and this is a familiar known phrase.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.740
You've seen one, you've seen them all.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:17.480
We dropped the word ‘if’, we reduce ‘you've’ to just ye-- and we reduce ‘them’ to ‘um’.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.320
You seen.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.280
Seen um.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.820
You've seen one. You seen them all.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.120
Another scenario where you may use this:

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.360
do you want to visit Paris?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.400
Nah, I'm not that into cities.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.260
You've seen one, you've seen them all.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.620
Eh, You've seen one, you've seen them all.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.320
A lot of them are pretty similar.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.860
A lot of them.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.000
My dad also reduced 'them' to 'um'.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.820
This is a really common reduction just like in the phrase ‘you've seen one, you seen them all’.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.320
A lot of them.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.620
A lot of them.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.640
Practice that with me out loud, smoothly connecting all the words.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.740
A lot of them.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.680
A lot of them.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.920
A lot of them are pretty similar.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.380
But you do have a great view? You can see a long way out over the... a couple of different mountain ranges.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.860
A couple of different mountain ranges.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.900
My dad reduced the word ‘of’ to just the schwa. Uh.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.820
A couple of—

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.280
We do this so much in conversation especially with this phrase: a couple of—

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.000
A couple of different mountain ranges. And the lake itself is probably—

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.140
Probably— This is how we pronounce ‘probably’ most of the time in conversation.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.840
You can do it too. It simplifies the word and makes it easier to say.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.040
Try it now.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.760
Probably.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.820
Probably.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.680
Probably.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.160
Itself is probably hundred yards across and maybe 200 by 400.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.200
Does anyone ever swim there?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680
I did see somebody swim in there once.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.560
- Very cold. 
- Ice cold. Really cold.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.820
Listen to the different ways we describe how cold it is.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.920
- Very cold. 
- Ice cold. Really cold.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.400
Really cold.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.620
Ice cold.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.140
Very cold.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:19.500
'Really’ and ‘very’ are words we use before adjectives to say there's a lot of something.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.140
Really cold.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.500
Very cold.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.000
A high amount of coldness.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.740
Ice cold is another great way to describe something being very cold.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.700
Now this lake is not ice, its water, it's very cold water.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.800
So describing it as ice cold is an exaggeration, a hyperbole.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.860
I know it's not actually ice.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.280
I know it's just extremely cold water.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.740
- Very cold. 
- Ice cold. Really cold.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.680
I had no temptation to do that.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.100
Yeah, I don’t think I will either.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.820
This is just… you can't design a better day.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.900
There's not much wind, hardly any clouds,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.960
cool but not cold, and this time of year, you have a lot of aspens turning yellow.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.660
This time of year.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.960
Another example of reducing the word ‘of’ to just the schwa in natural conversation.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.180
This time of year.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.680
This time of year, you have a lot of aspens turning yellow and these bushes, I mean, they would be green

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.840
and in the summer.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.300
Yeah it looks awesome. I mean, I love, I love the view.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.800
Yeah.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.080
Sweeping views.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.760
And we have seen wildlife along here.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.140
Yeah, just a couple hundred yards down. Once, there were four moose.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.460
Moose.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.900
These animals are fairly rare to see in the wild.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.340
One other time when I was in Colorado, we saw one.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.780
Click here or in the video description to see that video.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.220
There were four moose grazing right by the path.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.800
Further down yet, we saw heard of maybe  10 or 15 antelope.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.880
- Wow.
- Galloping along. You often see deer.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.400
You often see.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.400
My dad reduced ‘you’ to ye, changing the vowel to the schwa.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.740
This is also a common reduction.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.180
Why do we do this?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:26.380
Because in American English, the contrast between stressed and unstressed syllables is really important.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.040
So if we can make unstressed syllables even shorter by changing something, then we do that.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.940
You often see.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.880
You often see deer up here and then on the rocks, you can see marmots

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.880
sometime and pike which are little tiny animals like and they squeak.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.840
How many times have you done this hike?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.360
Probably five or six.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.540
Probably.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.100
There's another probably to probably reduction.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.280
Probably five or six.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.880
And to me, it's the most scenic hike around here especially in September.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:08.440
Scenic. This is a great word you can use to describe a beautiful landscape. Scenic.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.740
Scenic.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.660
To me it's the most scenic hike around here especially in September

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:21.880
because the aspen are turning yellow and a lot of these bushes are turning red and in June, July,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:28.000
it's just the waters too high you'd have to take off your shoes and put on sandals and just wade through.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.780
So usually, we wait till August or September to do this one.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.880
Wade.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.920
This is what you do when you're walking through water.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.720
So you're not swimming. You're walking like through a creek.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.520
If the water is too deep, then you can't wade. You have to swim.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.660
Take off your shoes and put on sandals and just wade through.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:55.640
Here is David walking over the creek that dad says you have to wade through when the water is higher.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.860
We didn't make it to the top.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.100
Yeah but we got to a good turning around point

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.640
and we had a fantastic view, we had lunch looking out down the long valley.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.980
Couldn't have been better.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.880
Couldn't have been better.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.560
A word here is being reduced to just the schwa.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.700
What word is it?

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.060
We noticed before that the word ‘of’ reduces to just the schwa.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.320
But here it's the word ‘have’.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.780
Yes, the word ‘have’ can be changed to just the schwa sound: uh in conversation

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:39.060
especially after could, couldn't, should, shouldn't, would, wouldn't.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:46.300
I've actually seen native speakers mess this up and write ‘should of’ instead of ‘should have’.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:53.860
It makes sense because ‘of’ and ‘have’ can both produce the same single sound, the schwa.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.700
Shoulda.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:04.880
But if this sound is following could, couldn't, should, shouldn't, would, wouldn't, the word is definitely ‘have’

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.380
and reducing ‘have’ to just the schwa after these words will help your English sound natural.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.560
Practice.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.600
Couldn’t have.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.800
Couldn’t have.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.000
Notice I'm dropping the T in the contraction. This is how native speakers will say this phrase.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.240
Couldn’t have.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.720
Couldn’t have.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.280
Special thanks to my dad for being in yet another Rachel's English video.
