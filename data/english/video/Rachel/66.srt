00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.790
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to ride our bikes into Brooklyn

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.950
to make some pizza. And of course, you'll
learn some American English pronunciation

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.950
on the way, including the idioms to catch
up and to fill in. Oh boy!

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.559
This is my bicycle, Jenny. I didn't name her,
she came named. Tonight we're going to go

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.729
for a bike ride into Brooklyn. Brooklyn is
the borough just east of Manhattan (one of

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:45.299
the boroughs just east of Manhattan). So let's
look at Brooklyn. It has two O's. Now, there

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:59.860
are four different ways to pronounce two O's:
oo, as in boo, uh as in book, uh as in blood,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:07.900
and oh as in brooch. So how is it pronounced
in Brooklyn? Uh, uh, Brooklyn. What's your

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:18.340
guess? The answer is: it's the same as the
vowel in 'book'. Brooklyn. Now. Let's get

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.790
going before it gets dark.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.080
It's about a 45-minute bike ride from my home
in Manhattan to my friend's home in Brooklyn.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.450
It involves taking the Manhattan bridge over
the East River.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.550
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.810
It's seven o'clock on the nose, seven o'clock
sharp. Those idioms mean, of course, exactly

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:57.300
seven o'clock. We're right on time. We're very
punctual. Punk - chew - ul. Let's go Sara.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.050
&gt;&gt; So we rode our bikes in from Brooklyn.
&gt;&gt; No! In from Manhattan!

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.039
&gt;&gt; We rode our bikes from Manhattan into Brooklyn
--- because it's been a while since we've

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.000
seen each other. So we're making some dinner,
we're making pizza, and we're going to catch up.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.000
&gt;&gt; We're going to catch up. [2x]
&gt;&gt; Find out what's going on in each other's lives.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.560
&gt;&gt; That's right. Catch up. An idiom that you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.010
would use if you haven't seen somebody in
a while, and you want to know what's going

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.569
on. You would say, "let's catch up". You could
also say, "fill me in". What else could you

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.260
say? Ketchup, by the way, spelled this way,
is also a condiment.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.260
&gt;&gt; This girl can cook. You remember -- from
the turkey.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:55.420
Cook. Does that 'uh' sound sound familiar?
It's the same sound as in 'book' and 'Brooklyn'.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.060
Listen again.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.480
&gt;&gt; This girl can cook. You remember -- from
the turkey.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.340
&gt;&gt; Oh boy.
&gt;&gt; Oh boy. I like that phrase.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.890
&gt;&gt; Oh boy?
&gt;&gt; It's a good one. What, do you say that

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.989
when you're exasperated? Oh boy.
&gt;&gt; Overwhelmed, like when you're overwhelmed?

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.530
&gt;&gt; It's a good one. Oh boy.
&gt;&gt; Or excited.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.269
&gt;&gt; Or excited. Oh boy!

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.269
&gt;&gt; Is this done Beads? I don't know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I think, well.

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.330
The first pie always takes longer because
of the oven.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.900
Did you hear how I said 'cuz of the oven'?
Cuzof, cuzof, cuzof. If I said that out of

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.890
the context of a sentence, nobody would know
what I was talking about. But as a part of

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.650
the whole, that's they way it makes sense
to say it. Cuzof. We reduce it, it's low in

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.450
pitch, cuzofthe, cuzofthe, cuzofthe oven.
Then the 'oven' is the stressed word. So,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.980
this is very important in English: that the
function words, the less important words,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.800
are low in pitch, strung together, maybe reduced,
to contrast with the shape of the stressed

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.900
word: cuzofthe oven.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.020
&gt;&gt; So, when it's pretty much cooked. Actually,
when it's cooked.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.069
&gt;&gt; Hold on, did you, did you guys notice,
she just said 'pretty', with a flap T. Can

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:18.639
you say that again?
&gt;&gt; What? It's pretty much?

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.779
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but say it at the camera!
&gt;&gt; Pretty much.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.199
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the demonstration.
&gt;&gt; You're welcome!

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.559
&gt;&gt; Ok, when it's pretty much cooked?
&gt;&gt; When it's pretty much cooked, we're going

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:34.699
to bring it out, and we're going to put arugula---
&gt;&gt; Hold on. Did you notice? She's using 'gonna'.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.830
We're gonna bring it out, we're gonna put
arugula.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.520
&gt;&gt; Yes, we're going to put arugula, and we're
going to put prosciutto, and we're going to

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.229
crumble some more blue cheese and we're going
to drizzle it with honey.

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.559
&gt;&gt; Wow, that sounds amazing, and it was such
a good demonstration of using 'gonna'. Thank

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.269
you.
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:04:55.269 --> 00:05:02.239
&gt;&gt; This looks pretty good. Pretty good.
&gt;&gt; Pretty: flap T!

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:09.239
&gt;&gt; Ok. Let's slice this baby up.

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.599
&gt;&gt; My favorite topping: pepperoni. I like
it almost as much as I like buying shoes.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.300
Then we made a second pizza, totally different
from the first, and sat down to a nice meal.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.479
After the lovely evening, it was time to say
good-bye.

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.219
&gt;&gt; Bye! Thank you so much!
&gt;&gt; Bye! You're welcome.

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.669
&gt;&gt; It was good to see you, it was so good
to catch up!

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.729
&gt;&gt; It was good to catch up.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.979
That's it, and thanks so much
