00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.279
In this American English pronunciation video,
I'm going to make a steaming bowl of ramen

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:14.270
noodles. Of course, we'll also study pronunciation,
and we'll see a lot of reduction in action,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:21.270
like 'gotta', 'gonna', them, and can. Stay
tuned, it's going to be a blast.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:36.670
This video is actually not entirely about
American English pronunciation. It's by request

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.590
from my mother because when I was with her
over Christmas I was telling her how much

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.210
I love to make ramen noodles. And she thought
that was sort of gross. Did you notice? I

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:58.910
made a flap T out of the T in 'sort of'. This
is because it comes after an R, before a vowel

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.890
sound. Sort of. We'll want to link the D to
the next word, which begins with a vowel,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:15.770
sort of, sort of, so it sounds more like one
word than two separate units. Sort of. 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.979
Let's listen again.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.079
Sort of gross. [3x] --ramen noodles. And she
thought that was sort of gross.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.630
I assured her it's not gross. Not the way
I make it! So this video is for her: how I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.299
make my ramen noodles. Now I was also on vacation
with my aunt. A-U-N-T. I know that aunt is

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.430
not the number one pronunciation for that
word. Most people pronounce it aunt. I use

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:59.689
aunt. So let's look: mom, aunt, ramen. They
all have that AH vowel, but each one of those

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.920
words spells the AH vowel differently. Ok,
let's get cooking.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.110
First, I take the bowl that I'm going to eat
my ramen soup in. Fill it up. It's got to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.900
be kind of big. Do you remember in the Thanksgiving
video when we reduced "I have got to" to "I've

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:32.209
gotta", or, "I gotta"? It's happening here.
"It has got to": I'm reducing it to "It's

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.409
gotta, it's gotta". Listen again.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.129
It's got to be kind of big. [3x]

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:53.569
Maybe leave about an inch at the top. I'm
going to put it on high. Did you notice? I'm

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:02.489
gonna. I've reduced "I am going to" to "I'm
gonna". Of course, use of 'gonna' is very

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:12.250
prevalent in everyday spoken American English.
I'm gonna. The first syllable has the G consonant,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:20.629
'uh' as in 'butter' vowel, a nice, clean N,
and the second syllable, the schwa. The first

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:33.549
syllable is stressed, gon-, and the second syllable
unstressed, -a. Gonna, gonna. Listen again.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.750
I'm going to put it on high. [3x]

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:50.970
Oops. Wrong burner. You'd think I would know
by now. OK. So. While that's heating up, let's

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.980
talk about the vegetable situation. Come over
here camera lady. So I'm going to use mushrooms,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.049
I have some frozen green beans, and carrots.
Um, I love to use bok choy but I don't have

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.870
any. I'm going to garnish with a little cilantro.
And you know what? I'm remembering that in

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.959
my freezer, I have some chopped up onions
that I already fried one time when I made

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.970
an absolutely ridiculous amount of fried onions.
So I'm actually going to chip off a little

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.110
bit of that to throw in as well.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.670
Ok, so, I'm going to chop up my mushrooms.
I'm going to try to be careful not to loose

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.780
any finger parts in the process. I'm not exactly
gifted in the kitchen. I have lost finger

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.910
parts in the past.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.610
Don't make them too small. Did you notice?
I reduced the word 'them' to the schwa-M sound:

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:57.660
um, um. Because in this pronunciation the
word 'them' begins with a vowel, and the word

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.350
before, 'make', ends with a K, I'm going to
make sure that those two words link and feel

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:14.610
like one unit --- make 'em, make 'em --- rather
than two separate words. Listen again.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.640
Don't make them too small [3x], because we
are going to be eating this with chopsticks.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:29.630
It's got to be a grabbable size. Ok, I'm also
going to put in a carrot. Carrots, I like

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.040
to cut them on the diagonal, because again
it makes them bigger. Did you notice? Two

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:44.820
more cases where the word 'them' was reduced
to 'em. I like to cut them on the diagonal,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.260
cut them, cut them. We're taking the final
letter of the word 'cut', we're attaching

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:59.120
it to the word 'em, 'em, and because the T
now comes between two vowels, I turned that

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:07.950
T into a flap, or, a light D sound. Cut them,
cut them. Also, the phrase "it makes them

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:18.500
bigger, makes them bigger." Again, 'them'
reduced to 'em, 'em. Also did you notice,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:31.350
I reduced the word 'because' to simply cuz,
cuz. The K, schwa, Z sound. Cuz it makes 'em,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:38.840
cuz it makes 'em. And, as usual, when you
reduce something, you link it to the words

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:48.430
that come around it. Cuz it, cuz it, cuz it
makes 'em. The Z sound links to the next word

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.450
'it'. Listen to the phrases again.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:58.100
I like to cut them on the diagonal, because
again it makes them bigger, easier to grab

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:08.430
with a chopstick. Ok, so then I'm going to
use the frozen green beans from Trader Joe's.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:18.800
And my frozen onion, which actually, when
I made it, I had fried in grease from ground

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.550
beef. What? She just gave me, camera lady
just gave me a face that was like "that's

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.690
gross." And you know what? It's not gross.
It just --- it makes it more tasty. Ok. I'm

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:40.810
guessing that the water is boiling. So I'm
now ready to head over to the pot. Just a

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:47.940
quick note: did you see how much the jaw dropped
in the word 'pot'? And you can see a dark

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:54.910
space in the mouth because the tongue is pressed
down in the back. Just the way the AH vowel

00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:01.740
should be.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.720
It's not boiling. I need to be patient.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.280
So, to make my broth, I'm not just going to
use the packet that came with the ramen of

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.570
course. I will use some of it, but I'm going
to supplement--- Hey! Another 'gonna'. I'm

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:25.010
gonna supplement. I'm gonna supplement. But
I'm going to supplement with fish sauce, soy

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:34.450
sauce, sugar, some fresh lemon, and probably
a little fresh pepper as well. It's boiling.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:50.000
In goes the ramen. I give it just a few seconds
to start to break up. Even though these are

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.160
frozen, it's ok to throw them right in. Did
you notice how quickly I said the word "it's"?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:04.950
I reduced it by dropping the vowel altogether,
and attaching the TS sound to the next word.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:16.250
Tsokay, tsokay. This was very fast of me,
quite casual. It's ok to throw them right in.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:30.250
And now all the vegetable that we've chopped
goes in. Mmm, tasty. Break up the noodles

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:40.040
a little bit. Ok, I'm going to put in my sauce
ingredients. Little fish sauce, just a few

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:53.730
drops. Little soy sauce, just a few drops.
Little sugar. That wasn't enough. There we

00:09:53.730 --> 00:10:07.270
go. Where did my ramen packet go? There it
is. And then maybe half of this. Ok. Lemon

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:18.080
juice. Oops, don't want that seed to fall
in. Ok, so there it is. I'm going to mix it

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:27.330
up, I'm going to let it go for not very long.
Just maybe two minutes before my next step.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:38.050
We're going to put an egg in this guy. Ok, so, 
I take my egg. Get it all nice and good and

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:50.040
cracked. Can you see? Can you see? I reduced
the word 'can' to cn, cn. That's because,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:58.240
in this sentence, it's a helping verb. 'See'
is the main verb. Helping verbs will usually

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:11.340
be unstressed. And 'can' likes to reduce when
it's unstressed to cn: K sound, schwa, N.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.000
Cn, Cn. Can you see? Listen again.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.390
Can you see? [x3] ---in there?

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:32.720
Then, just split it open, dump it right in,
put on the lid, turn off the heat, boom!

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.810
So now I'm going to dump the ramen into my
bowl, and I have this little spoon because

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:44.000
I'm going to hold up the egg, so that the
egg doesn't get crushed in the process. So

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.590
I dump it all. And now I'll put the egg in.
And now, if I want a runny yolk, I just leave

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:58.260
it as it is. If I want the yolk to be more
cooked, then what I'll do is I'll pick up

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:06.560
some noodles and sort of cover it. And that
will cook it. So that maybe when I'm half

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.370
way through, or towards the end of my bowl
of ramen, I have a delicious yolk that's mostly

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:19.420
cooked. Mmm, I love it. Ok, last thing, going
to garnish with a little bit of cilantro.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:28.630
Not a must, just because I had it. And there
you go, mom, auntie, a bowl of ramen.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:34.300
As a thanks for being my camera lady, I'm
going to let my friend Sara eat this delicious

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.660
bowl of ramen.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:42.460
What do you think Sara?
&gt;&gt; It's delicious.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.930
I know I'm no master chef. And probably a
lot of my students can make a much better

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:54.860
noodle dish than I can. I'm obsessed with
noodles right now, so please send me your

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:01.120
recipes! Post a photo to my Facebook page,
or maybe even post a video of you making your

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.000
noodle dish. I can't wait to get some recipes!

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.839
That's it, and thanks so much 
for using Rachel's English.
