00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.069
As many of you probably know, hurricane Sandy
devastated the east coast at the end of October,

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.580
2012. The next day I hopped on my bike and
checked in on friends who live in southern

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.060
Manhattan to see how they were doing.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.980
First, let me talk about the word 'hurricane'.
Three syllable word, stress on the first syllable.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.480
It has the H consonant sound, the 'ur' as
in 'her' vowel/consonant, hur-, hur-, that's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.739
the stressed syllable. Then the IH as in SIT,
K consonant sound, AY diphthong, and finally

00:00:44.739 --> 00:01:00.370
the N consonant sound. So the two unstressed
syllables: -icane, -icane. No shape in the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.840
voice, lower and flatter. Also, lower in volume.
Hurricane. Hurricane.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.070
&gt;&gt; Laura, the reason why I can hardly see
you is because power's out.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.630
In this sentence, the word 'can' is a helping
verb. It's not the main verb. So, it's a function

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.140
word, and I'm reducing it to 'kn', 'kn', 'I
kn'. Listen again.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.479
&gt;&gt; Laura, the reason why I can [3x]
&gt;&gt; Laura, the reason why I can hardly see

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.590
you is because power's out.
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.479
&gt;&gt; Now, what time did you guys lose power
last night?

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.420
Let's take a look at the T pronunciations
in the sentence fragment 'last night'. Notice

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.890
I didn't say the T in the word 'last'. Normally,
as being part of an ending consonant cluster,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.040
that would be pronounced. But often, when
the next sound is another consonant, the ending

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.970
T in a consonant cluster will be dropped.
Last night, last night. Are you noticing also

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.329
a stop T at the end of the word 'night'? I'm
not releasing the tt sound. Night, night.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:13.829
However, it's not the same as dropping the
T: nigh', nigh'. The stop T makes the word

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:21.359
more abrupt, night, night. And it doesn't
have quite the downward shape in voice, nigh-,

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:30.029
nigh-, that it would have if I dropped the
T altogether. Night, night. Last night. Listen

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:30.669
again.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:36.209
&gt;&gt; Now, what time did you guys lose power
last night? [3x]

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.659
&gt;&gt; Uh, we lost power just a little after 8:30.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:49.230
Another stop T. Eight-thirty. Eight, eight.
Eight-thirty. Notice that the T in the word

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.650
'thirty' is being pronounced as a flap T because
it comes after an R and before a vowel. Thirty,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.779
thirty. Eight-thirty. Listen again.

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:05.889
&gt;&gt; 8:30 [3x]
&gt;&gt; Any idea when you're going to get your

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.209
power back on?
&gt;&gt; No idea --- could be several days.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.769
&gt;&gt; What are you going to do with these days
with no power?

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.439
What are you going to do? A couple reductions
here. First, the word 'are' is being reduced

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.829
to 'er', 'er'. So, the T at the end of 'what'
now comes between two vowel sounds and is

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.579
a flap T. What are, what are, what are, what
are you going to do? Notice I'm also reducing

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.059
'going to' to gonna, gonna. What are you gonna
do? Listen again.

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:42.319
&gt;&gt; What are you going to do [3x] with these
days with no power?

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.180
&gt;&gt; Um, well. Plan to do a lot of sitting and
thinking. Staring out windows. Maybe some

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.930
Balderdash. Who knows?
&gt;&gt; Games.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.109
&gt;&gt; Games.
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a great way to spend the

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.449
next couple of days. If you ever need to recharge
anything, just come on up to my apartment.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:07.680
Apartment. Two stop T's. So the T's in this
word don't really follow the rules for T pronunciations.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.689
Apartment, apartment. Listen again.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:18.319
&gt;&gt; My apartment [3x], you can have all the
power and internet that you want.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.679
Another 'can' reduction: you can, you can.
You can have.

00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:27.370
&gt;&gt; You can have [3x] all the power and internet
that you want.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.309
&gt;&gt; Will do.
&gt;&gt; And hot water.

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.780
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.210
I also want to point out something interesting
about the word 'weather'. 'Weather' can be

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.409
both a noun or a verb. Now, that's not that
interesting. There are lots of words in American

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.889
English that are that way. But thing about
weather is that both as a noun and as a verb,

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.460
it's pronounced the same way. Stress on the
first syllable: weather, weather. Normally,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.669
there will be a difference in pronunciation.
For example, the word 'present'. Present is

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:07.680
the noun, stress is on the first syllable.
Present. But as a verb, present, present,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.370
stress is on the second syllable, so the two
words are pronounced differently. Present,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:20.469
present. But with 'weather', both the same.
Both as a noun: we're having terrible weather.

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.960
And as a verb: we'll weather this storm. Weather,
weather.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.569
&gt;&gt; So Sara, How did you guys weather the storm
last night?

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.789
&gt;&gt; We weathered it amazingly well. Um, perhaps
because the weather was not too crazy around

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.749
here. At least it didn't seem so.
&gt;&gt; But you did lose power.

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.800
&gt;&gt; We lost power.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.819
So, most people are out of power. But luckily,
they don't live too far from me. So my home

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:57.590
has been able to be a haven of internet and
electricity for all my friends.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.569
Thank you to those who showed concern about
me and my family during the hurricane. As

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.530
you can see, I came through just fine. It
was great to see so many supporting those

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.099
who went without electricity, heat, and hot
water for many days. For example, some stores

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.639
that had power set up charging stations in
front so people could see the news and be

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:23.469
in touch with loved ones. It was strange to
walk around a darkened Manhattan. Though for

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:28.189
most people, life is back to normal, others
are still living without electricity and even

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:34.039
running water. And others lost their homes
entirely. As time goes on, let's continue

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.249
to help out those affected by this hurricane.

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:40.249
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
