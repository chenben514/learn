00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.650
In this American English pronunciation video,
you’re going to come with me and my parents

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.730
to Colorado. You’ll get to see some of the
natural beauty of this state, and study American

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.010
English pronunciation in real life.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:33.300
Today’s topics: Words that reduce. At, for,
that’s, can, and, was, and probably.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.720
&gt;&gt; This…
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.419
&gt;&gt; There we go.
&gt;&gt; So, we’re at 12,335 feet. Now, yesterday

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:48.399
morning, when I got on a plane, I was at about
1 foot, there at New York’s LaGuardia airport.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.589
So no wonder I had such a hard time catching
my breath on this hike.

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.949
&gt;&gt; So for the metric fans of Rachel’s English,
this is almost 4,000 meters.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.079
&gt;&gt; It’s pretty high.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.670
Americans speak with a mix of long and short
syllables. It’s what helps make speech clear

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.380
to us. Short syllables are often reductions—words
where we’ve changed or dropped a sound to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.409
help us say them faster.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.229
Let’s discuss three reductions in the passage
you just saw.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.770
The first is the word AT. AT has the AA vowel.
But usually we reduce that in a sentence to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.469
the schwa, at. I can make that very fast,
at. It’s abrupt because I’m making a Stop

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:45.310
T. That’s because the next word begins with
a consonant. At twelve, at, at, at twelve,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.100
we’re at twelve. When I make the word ‘at’
very short, it makes the word ‘twelve’

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.189
more important. This is what makes English
clear. Listen again.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:04.219
&gt;&gt; at 12 [3x]
&gt;&gt; At 12,335 feet. Now, yesterday morning,

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.679
when I got on a plane, I was at about 1 foot

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:16.340
Another ‘at’ example: I was at about 1
foot. I was at about. I was at about. Do you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.150
hear how ‘I’ and ‘bout’ are clearer?
The middle three syllables are all less clear:

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.430
was at a, was at a. Though it may seem wrong
to make some syllables less clear, it actually

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.620
makes speech overall more clear to Americans,
because American English depends on this contrast

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:48.739
of long and short syllables. Was at a, was
at a. Practice that with me. Was at a, was

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.239
at a, was at a. You really need to simplify
the sounds and mouth movements, and take some

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.879
of the energy and volume out of the voice
to make these syllables this fast. Yes, do

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:09.239
that. Was at a. Was at a. 
I was at about. Listen again.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.879
&gt;&gt; I was at about [3x]
1 foot, there at New York’s LaGuardia

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.969
airport. So no wonder I had such a hard time
catching my breath on this hike.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.250
&gt;&gt; So for the metric fans of Rachel’s English…

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.750
The reduction of the word ‘for’. For.
In a sentence, you’ll usually hear it as

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:42.620
‘fer’. How fast can you make it? Practice.
Fer, fer, fer. Listen again.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.709
&gt;&gt; For the metric fans
&gt;&gt; for [5x] the metric fans of Rachel’s

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.989
English, this is almost 4,000 meters.
&gt;&gt; It’s pretty high.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:01.420
Finally, the word ‘that’s’ was reduced
to ‘ts’. TS pretty. TS pretty high, ts.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.980
This is the same reduction we would use for
‘what’s’ or ‘it’s’. At the end

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.849
of the video, follow the link for more information
on the TS reduction.

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.199
&gt;&gt; That’s pretty high.
&gt;&gt; Ts [6x] pretty high.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.759
&gt;&gt; Ts pretty high. [2x]
&gt;&gt; Very high.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.490
&gt;&gt; As you can see.
&gt;&gt; Very cold and windy.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.620
We just heard two more reductions. The word
‘can’, a helping verb here, was reduced

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:49.949
to kn. How fast can you make that? Practice
with me: kn, kn, kn. Can see. Listen again.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.620
&gt;&gt; You can see [2x]
&gt;&gt; Can [4x]

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.500
&gt;&gt; You can see.
&gt;&gt; Very cold and windy.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:10.680
And the ‘and’ reduction: nn, nn. Practice
with me. Nn, nn. Make it fast. Cold n,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.510
cold n windy.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.610
&gt;&gt; Very cold and windy.
&gt;&gt; Cold and [3x]

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.150
&gt;&gt; Very cold and windy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It’s very interesting landscape.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.580
&gt;&gt; Mom, what did that sign say about this
area?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.110
&gt;&gt; It said that this was once a vast plain.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:42.120
Mom reduced ‘was’. She said wuz instead
of was. It’s less clear, isn’t it? Was,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.690
was. That this was once, wuz. That’s exactly
what we want for these unimportant words.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.430
Listen again.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:03.159
&gt;&gt; It said that
this was [3x], was [4x]

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:12.059
&gt;&gt; It said that
this was [3x], was [4x]

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:17.330
&gt;&gt; It said that this was once a vast plain,
that was pushed…

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.689
Another reduced was, wuz, wuz. That was pushed.

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.650
&gt;&gt; That was [3x]
pushed and thrust upward by tremendous pressures

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.569
of the earth.
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You can see some patches of snow
over there.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:44.320
Did you catch that ‘can’ reduction? Can,
you can, you can see, can, can.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You
can [3x] see some patches of snow

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.970
you can see some patches of snow over there.
&gt;&gt; Where?

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.139
&gt;&gt; Right over there.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.879
&gt;&gt; They’re very dirty.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:07:00.190
&gt;&gt; That’s all that’s left from last year’s
snowfall. And they’ll probably get snow

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.419
here within the next couple of weeks.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.170
Did you hear how my dad said probably? He
reduced it to ‘prolly’.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:14.330
&gt;&gt; Probably [3x]
And they’ll probably get snow [3x]

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.810
A real life example of the word ‘probably’
– At the end of the video, follow the link

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.150
for information on reducing this word.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.770
&gt;&gt; You can see some patches of snow over there.
&gt;&gt; Where?

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.939
&gt;&gt; Right over there.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:30.680
&gt;&gt; They’re very dirty.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.990
&gt;&gt; That’s all that’s left from last year’s
snowfall. And they’ll probably get snow

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.910
here within the next couple of weeks.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:46.900
I hope you enjoyed this cold mountaintop study
of real life American English. I know it seems

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:53.060
strange to pronounce things quickly, not fully,
but reductions are an important part of American

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:59.610
English. Follow the links here, or in the
description below, for more information on

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:06.910
the reductions we studied today. That’s it,
and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.
