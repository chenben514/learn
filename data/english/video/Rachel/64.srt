00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.099
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to talk about places.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.050
In this video, we're talking about trips we've
taken recently. Notice how we use phrases

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.699
like 'for work', 'for fun', 'for school' when
talking about a trip. 'For' is one of those

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:34.230
words that's often reduced (to 'fer'). You'll
also hear several idioms.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.719
So Annie is our dear, dear friend visiting
from Denver. Denver. Now, my voice went up,

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.359
Denver, because I was making a pause but not
done with my thought. But normally, that word

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:53.219
would be said 'Denver'. Stress is on the first
syllable, and the -er ending, unstressed,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.409
as always, must be very short: -ver, -ver,
-ver. Denver.

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.019
&gt;&gt; Now, where were you before you came here?
&gt;&gt; Um, I was in Boston.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.660
Boston. Another two syllable city name with
stress on the first syllable. So the second

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.480
syllable, unstressed, must be short to contrast
the length and shape of the first syllable. Boston.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.400
&gt;&gt; Annie, now, where were you before you came
here?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.220
&gt;&gt; Um, I was in Boston.
&gt;&gt; For work?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.060
&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed.
&gt;&gt; Umm-hmm.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.650
&gt;&gt; There was a minor hiccup with a situation
with a badge where I was not allowed access.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
&gt;&gt; Wait, hold on, I love your use of the word
'hiccup' here. Now, can you explain it? What

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.530
do you mean by hiccup?
&gt;&gt; Um, there was a situation which was not

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.670
ideal, it was a bump in the road.
&gt;&gt; Bump in the road. Now that's a---that's

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.930
also an idiom. Could you explain that?
&gt;&gt; It was really what I would call a hurdle

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.160
that I had to jump.
&gt;&gt; A hurdle.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.660
We're laughing because sometimes it's hard
to explain an idiom without using another

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.260
idiom. A hiccup. A bump in the road. A hurdle
to jump. So a hiccup or a bump in the road

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.149
is something that comes up that was not planned.
So, during her new job orientation, there

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.440
was a hiccup. A hurdle to jump, meaning there
were some unforeseen difficulties that she

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.790
had to deal with. Listen again to this string
of idioms.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.480
&gt;&gt; There was a minor hiccup with a situation
with a badge where I was not allowed access.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.620
&gt;&gt; What do you mean by hiccup?
&gt;&gt; Um, there was a situation which was not

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.750
ideal, it was a bump in the road.
&gt;&gt; Bump in the road. Now that's a---that's

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.060
also an idiom. Could you explain that?
&gt;&gt; It was really what I would call a hurdle

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.200
that I had to jump.
&gt;&gt; A hurdle.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.480
&gt;&gt; And you were---you had this hiccup in your
new job orientation.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; How excited are you though for your new

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.290
job?
&gt;&gt; I'm excited. Um, it's a great opportunity,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.960
um, just such an amazing experience to meet
some new people. This is all very genuine.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.790
Um, um yeah.
&gt;&gt; I may or may not be putting you on the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.959
spot.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.819
To be put on the spot, or, to put somebody
on the spot. This is an idiom that means to

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.340
ask somebody to do something or make a decision
without preparation, and maybe in front of

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.270
other people. In this case, I'm putting Annie
on the spot because I'm asking her to talk

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.319
about something in front of the video camera
with no preparation. Here the T in 'put' is

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.819
a flap T, or a D sound, because it comes between
two vowels when we link the words together. 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.120
Put on the spot.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.270
&gt;&gt; Putting you on the spot. Could you explain
that idiom?

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.349
&gt;&gt; Um, that means that you are the focal point.
You are really---there is a certain amount

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.170
of pressure.
&gt;&gt; And there was no preparation, maybe.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.480
&gt;&gt; Hot seat. Hot seat. No preparation. It's
spontaneous, it's, um...

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.120
&gt;&gt; You didn't know you were going to be asked
to speak.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.849
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Now, the other idiom you came up with

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.680
was 'hot seat'.
&gt;&gt; Yes it was.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.069
&gt;&gt; Can you make up a sentence with 'hot seat'?
&gt;&gt; Man. I hate being in the hot seat when

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.629
topic turns to something I am not quite comfortable
answering.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Shall I take you off the hot seat?
&gt;&gt; Please do, Rachel.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.560
&gt;&gt; Now Katherine, you were saying earlier
that you've been on a trip recently.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.930
&gt;&gt; Yes, I went to Baltimore.
&gt;&gt; I thought you went to DC?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.430
&gt;&gt; I went to DC too.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.860
Two more place names. Baltimore. Stress is
on the first syllable, so that should be the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.680
longest. After the stressed syllable, the
voice will come down in volume and pitch.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.529
So the last syllable: -more, -more, -more,
will be quick, low in pitch, and low in volume.

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.550
Baltimore. With DC, it's just the opposite. 
Stress is on the last syllable. 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.550
Any time you're naming

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:54.870
something by a list of letters, like DC or
HBO or MLK, stress is always on the last letter.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.049
So that letter will be the longest and have
the most shape. DC, C, DC.

00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:05.320
&gt;&gt; So, tell me a little bit about that trip.
&gt;&gt; To DC?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.210
&gt;&gt; Well, either one.
&gt;&gt; Um, well, I went to a college in DC. Um,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:18.070
and I looked at a fashion show, and looked
at portfolios, and ... um...

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.119
&gt;&gt; So this was for work.
&gt;&gt; This was for work.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.530
&gt;&gt; Well thanks for telling me about your trips
to Baltimore and DC.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.819
&gt;&gt; We were just talking, I went to India.
&gt;&gt; Oh you did? Recently?

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.300
&gt;&gt; About four years ago.
&gt;&gt; Was that for work or for fun?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.959
&gt;&gt; For fun.
&gt;&gt; What did you do there?

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:37.759
&gt;&gt; I studied Buddhism and Tibetan community
politics.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:43.039
&gt;&gt; That sounds like it's for school.
&gt;&gt; It was for school, but it was, ah, I took

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.740
a semester off from college to go.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.129
&gt;&gt; Renee, and, I hear that you took a trip
last weekend.

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:49.479
&gt;&gt; I did.
&gt;&gt; Where did you go?

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.779
&gt;&gt; I went to upstate New York.
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.819
&gt;&gt; Town called Hudson, on the Hudson River.
It was actually---are you interested in why

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.819
it was founded?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:05.419
&gt;&gt; It was founded by whalers who originally
whaled in Nantucket. But they decided to move

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.149
their families up the Hudson River to another
place that would still be on the water.

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:11.319
&gt;&gt; Why did they want to move their families
away from Nantucket?

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.519
&gt;&gt; I don't remember that part of the story.

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:19.889
&gt;&gt; Sara, where were you last weekend?
&gt;&gt; I went to visit my sister's family in Virginia.

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.110
&gt;&gt; Virginia. That's a fun state name.
&gt;&gt; It's a great state.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.830
&gt;&gt; Where did you go?
&gt;&gt; I went to Florida.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.689
&gt;&gt; Florida. Is that where you're from?
&gt;&gt; That's where I'm from!

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.089
&gt;&gt; I know, but you're from further north,
and I'm from further south.

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:36.849
&gt;&gt; I know. What did you do there?
&gt;&gt; Spend time with my family at my parent's

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.969
house. Went in the pool. I went to the beach
a bit, walked at sunset. And that's about it.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.089
&gt;&gt; That sounds lovely. Guys, thank you, everybody,

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.499
for telling me about the places that you've
recently been.

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.489
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Oh, we were so happy to share.

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:55.699
&gt;&gt; Really appreciate it.

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.189
&gt;&gt; Katherine.
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:03.919
&gt;&gt; If you were going to work on your American
English pronunciation---let's say you already

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.409
know some of the concepts, you've seen some
videos, but you want to really work it, to

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:13.339
get it into your habit. What would you do
to do that?

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:16.699
&gt;&gt; I would take the Rachel's English video
class.

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.699
&gt;&gt; Do you mean the Rachel's English online
course in July and August?

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.050
&gt;&gt; I'd take the Rachel's English ...
&gt;&gt; Ok, who can keep a straight face in here?

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:36.710
Because she can't, and she can't.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:42.219
To keep a straight face is to be able to do
something without laughing. Something my friends

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:48.849
clearly have a difficult time doing, which
is why we have so much fun together. Take

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:50.459
two.

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:53.699
&gt;&gt; Katherine.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.599
&gt;&gt; If you felt like you wanted to work on
your American English pronunciation this summer,

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:01.979
what would you do?
&gt;&gt; I would take the Rachel's English course

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:06.569
in July and August.
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a very smart woman. If

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:13.029
you didn't know, I am giving an online course
in July and August of 2012. Check out my website

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:14.860
for more details.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.729
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:25.419
Don't stop there. Have fun with my real-life
English videos. Or get more comfortable with

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:31.439
