00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.509
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to talk a little more about the

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.509
vowels EE and IH.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.270
Here along the Hudson River for Fleet Week,
they're bringing out some old-time replica

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.810
ships.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.140
Like the ones taken in this photo by my friend
Jovon.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.140
And this made me think about the vowels EE
and IH. 'Ships' has the IH as in SIT vowel.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.160
And 'fleet' 'week' both have the EE as in
SHE vowels. Now, I just did a video on the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.310
IH vowel versus the EE vowel, a comparison.
And I didn't talk about length at all. That's

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.630
because I don't think length really comes into
play when we're talking about a vowel on its

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.530
own. But since a lot of people teach length
when they teach these two vowels, I thought

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.350
I should talk about it. A lot of people will
say that 'ee' is a long vowel, and 'ih' is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.520
a short vowel. But I feel like vowels themselves
don't have a length. To me the length of a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.869
syllable depends on: is it a stressed syllable,
or is it unstressed? So, if the IH vowel is

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.490
in the stressed syllable of a content word,
then it will be long, even though some people

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.159
would call it a 'short' vowel.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.759
Another thing that can effect vowel length
is the ending consonant. If everything else

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.319
is the same, and the ending consonant is voiced,
then that vowel will be a little bit longer

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:37.229
than if the ending consonant is unvoiced.
So, for example, the word 'cap' will be a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.549
little bit shorter than the word 'cab'. Cap,
cab.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.939
So, in looking at the 'ee' vowel and the 'ih'
vowel: in the word 'beat' -- an unvoiced consonant

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.380
there at the end -- that 'ee' vowel is short.
Beat. But in the word 'bid' -- the ending

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.569
consonant there is voiced, so 'ih' will be
a little bit longer.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.229
So don't think about the length of the vowel
being tied to the vowel itself. It's tied

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.069
to the syllable, and the sentence position,
and maybe the ending consonant.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.950
This ship was interesting because instead
of raising their sails, they had people standing

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.640
where the sails would have been.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.989
Notice how 'been', spelled with two E's, is
actually pronounced with the IH as in SIT

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.989
vowel. Listen again. ...where the sails would
have been. [3x]

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.060
&gt;&gt; They're holding on to something.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.570
&gt;&gt; Hey Jovon.
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.489
&gt;&gt; Nice socks.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.989
&gt;&gt; Really like them.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, that means a lot.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:03.349
A couple interesting things happening with
pronunciation here. When I said, "nice socks,"

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:10.319
notice how I didn't make two separate S sounds,
nice--socks. Just one, connecting the two

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:22.329
words: nice socks. I also said, "really like
them," reducing the word 'them' to 'um'. And

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:29.329
connecting that word to the word before. Like
'em, like 'em. Listen again.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.869
&gt;&gt; Hey Jovon.
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.290
&gt;&gt; Nice socks.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.629
&gt;&gt; Really like them.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, that means a lot.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.450
&gt;&gt; Hey guys, what do you think of these ships?
&gt;&gt; I think these ships are great. Where I'm

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.739
from, in Arizona, there's no water. We don't
even have any lakes. And so ...

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.260
&gt;&gt; So this is a totally new experience for
you.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.019
&gt;&gt; It's a totally new experience.
&gt;&gt; They're really beautiful. Um, this is the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.499
200th anniversary of the War of 1812, so they're
celebrating this and some of them are, I think

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.459
are replicas from that time.
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.249
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I didn't know that. She knows everything.
&gt;&gt; Only a little bit. Thanks Wikipedia.

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:18.500
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.980

to know you.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.020
Don't stop there. Have fun with my real-life
English videos. Or get more comfortable with
