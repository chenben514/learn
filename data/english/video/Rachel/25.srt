00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:04.799
In this American English pronunciation video,
we’re going to go over:

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.580
&gt;&gt; Cheers [3x]

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.140
&gt;&gt; Cheers! Great to see you, HaQuyen.
&gt;&gt; Great to see you too, Rachel.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.640
At the table, at the bar, when you’re drinking
the first round, you might want to say “cheers.”

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.920
Do this if it’s a special occasion, if you’re
with friends you don’t see often, or just

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.920
because. David and I do it at home sometimes
when we sit down to dinner on just a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.660
regular day.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.620
&gt;&gt; Cheers!
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.840
This is a one-syllable word, and it’s a
stressed word. So it will have an up-down

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.979
shape in the voice. Uh, cheers, cheers.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:02.620
Start with the CH sound, ch, ch. To make the
sound, the tongue goes to the roof of the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:12.500
mouth, and your lips will flare. Hold the
air, ch, and then release, ch. In this case,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.020
release right into the EE vowel. Chee-. The
tongue tip is normally down for this vowel,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.950
but since it was up, and needs to be back
up for the R, you don’t need to bring it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:34.289
all the way down. The tongue tip doesn’t
have to touch back here. Cheer. Now the R.

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.219
The tongue should lift in the middle so it’s
lightly touching the sides of the roof of

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:44.329
the mouth. And the tip pulls back, it’s
not touching anything. So don’t pull back

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:53.630
the whole tongue, just the front. Flare the
lips a little bit. Cheers. We end with the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.520
Z sound. But the ending voiced consonants
are weak, so it shouldn’t sound like this:

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:12.709
zzz. It’s more like this: ss, ss: actually,
a really light S. Cheers, s, s, s. And don’t

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.370
forget the shape. Cheers, cheers.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.400
You might want to toast something in particular.
For example, “to summer vacation” or “Here’s

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.530
to Tom and Julie”.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.360
So use the phrase ‘to’ or ‘here’s
to’ – and you’ll to reduce ‘to’

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.260
in both of those cases: tuh. To summer vacation.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.400
&gt;&gt; To summer vacation.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.480
Here’s to. Here’s to Tom and Julie!

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.190
&gt;&gt; Here’s to Tom and Julie!

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.959
The T sound plus the schwa, really fast, to,
to, to. Because it’s not the word that matters,

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.030
what matters is summer vacation. To summer
vacation!

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.310
&gt;&gt; To the road trip!
&gt;&gt; To the road trip!

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.450
&gt;&gt; Cheers!

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.860
