00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.940
In this American English pronunciation video,
I'm going to talk about Thanksgiving with

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.940
my friend Sara. And then make an awesome imitation
exercise from it.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.860
What's so great about an imitation exercise?
When I make an imitation exercise, I'll take

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.920
a little bit of speech and loop it three times.
When this happens, it starts to sound less

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.020
like speech and maybe a little bit more like
music. This is a good thing, because as a

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.390
learner of English, you already have some
ideas about speech. And some of them probably

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.110
aren't right. So, if we can get you to hear
American English in a new way, it's a good

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.150
thing. Don't be so worried about what you're
saying, but think more about the pitches that

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.680
you're hearing, the rhythm that you're hearing,
and try to imitate that exactly.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.240
You'll hear each phrase three times, then
there will be a small pause for you to repeat.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.010
&gt;&gt; Everybody, you know my friend Sara. She's
been in some videos before. 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:17.350
[Sara, what is your favorite Thanksgiving memory?]
&gt;&gt; Um, my favorite Thanksgiving memory is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:31.049
when [my whole family, all my sisters] and
their husbands---

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:47.640
&gt;&gt; [She has three sisters and one brother.]

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.980
&gt;&gt; It's a lot of people.
&gt;&gt; That's a lot.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:02:15.059
&gt;&gt; [A couple years ago we got together] 
[for my parents' fortieth wedding anniversary], 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:29.959
and so we [had Thanksgiving and had a 
good time together.]

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.749
Um, and every year I'm near my 
dad for Thanksgiving,

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:49.340
I have to watch out because he likes to [get
involved in whatever I'm trying to cook.]

00:02:49.340 --> 00:03:00.080
&gt;&gt; Oh. [He tries to take over?]
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.419
&gt;&gt; So, that brings me to my next question:
which is, 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:15.419
[what is your favorite thing to eat
on Thanksgiving?]

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:37.170
&gt;&gt; Um, [my favorite thing 
is cranberry sauce, I love it.]

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:48.870
&gt;&gt; Love it too.
&gt;&gt; [It goes with lots of things.]

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:59.739
&gt;&gt; So Rachel, [what are you doing for Thanksgiving
this year?]

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:20.230
&gt;&gt; Well, [for Thanksgiving on Thursday], [I'm
actually not planning on doing anything].

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:41.010
[I'm probably going to do a lot of video editing]
[for Rachel's English. Gonna work.] 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:05:06.410
[The reason why I'm doing that is because]
[on Friday I'm going up to Massachusetts],

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:22.010
[and we're going to have
Thanksgiving dinner on Saturday.]

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:37.710
[Some friends that I used to live 
with when I lived in Boston.]

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:59.210
[So I'm still getting Thanksgiving,]
[just not on Thanksgiving Day.]

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:18.490
&gt;&gt; [Will you make anything?]
&gt;&gt; [I am going to make a corn casserole.] 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:42.790
[It's been requested.] [Apparently,
I make a very memorable corn casserole.]

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.710
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much Sara for being in my video.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.060
And happy Thanksgiving to everybody out there.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.960
That's, it, and thanks so much 
for using Rachel's English.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.620
