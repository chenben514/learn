00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.250
I'm here celebrating the 4th of July on my
rooftop. Come watch the fireworks with me.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.500
Happy 4th everyone!

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.099
Even the Empire State Building is celebrating!

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.910
Fireworks. This is a compound word. That is,
a word made up of two other words. In compound

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.390
words, the first word is stressed. So the
stress in this word falls on 'fire', fire.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.260
Fireworks begins with the F consonant sound.
Bottom lip up to touch the bottom of the top

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.079
front teeth. Fi-. Then we have the AI as in
BUY diphthong, fi-, fire. Next, the schwa-R

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.690
sound. 'Fire' is a one-syllable word. But
the schwa-R ending after the AI diphthong

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.890
will sort of make it feel like a two-syllable
word, with an unstressed 'er' ending. Fire,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.820
fire. Fireworks. The lips must come into a
tight circle for the W sound. Fireworks. Then

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:18.740
we have the UR as in HER / R consonant sound,
-wor-, firewor-, fireworks. And finally, the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.740
KS consonant cluster at the end. Fireworks.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.229
&gt;&gt; That's a finale.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.420
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
