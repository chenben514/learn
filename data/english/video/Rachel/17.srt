00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.520
In this American English pronunciation video,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.440
my uncle John is going to teach you how to make a Peach Melba.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.100
In this scene, my uncle is going to be listing things.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.140
He's going to be giving steps.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.500
Listen to how he introduces each step.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.580
Want to make peach melba? You make a raspberry currant sauce, that's what this is.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.780
And you start with the currant sauce at the bottom,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.880
and then you add some peaches,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.300
and then you want ice cream,  you add some ice cream.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.820
Is that vanilla?

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.520
Yup vanilla.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.940
And then a little more sauce.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.700
Another layer.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.240
And more peaches.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.960
Wow! Many layers!

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.640
Add in the whipped cream,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.520
Voila!

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.100
A lot of ‘and’ and ‘and then’.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400
Let's look at the pronunciation.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.700
Want to make peach melba? You make a raspberry currant sauce, that's what this is.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.900
And you start with the--

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.480
And you start— and—, nd— the word ‘and’ reduced, nd—

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.840
Schwa N

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.780
And you start—, and you start—, and you start with the...

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.200
currant sauce at the bottom.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.260
Bonus reduction, the word ‘at’. At the—, at the—, at the—, at the bottom…

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.300
At the—, quick schwa, stop T.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.080
Currant sauce at the bottom—, at the bottom-, at the bottom—

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.960
And then you add—

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.740
And then—, and then—,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.140
And, and, and— again, the word ‘and’ reduced.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.860
And then you add—, and then you add-,  and then you add some peaches,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.780
And then—

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.720
Again, schwa N.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.220
And then—

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.100
If you want ice cream, you add some ice cream.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.360
Is that vanilla?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.020
Yeah, vanilla.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.120
And then a little more sauce,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.560
And then—

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.260
And then a little more sauce,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
another ‘and’ reduction,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.040
And then a little more sauce…

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.380
Notice the word ‘little’ is pronounced with a Flap T.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.020
Little, ra- ra- ra- ra, little.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.500
This is a tricky word.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.560
And I do have a video on how to pronounce this word

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.020
so check the description below

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.560
or click here.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.860
And then a little more sauce…

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.900
Another layer!

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.280
Then more peaches.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.080
Wow! Many layers!

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.200
Add in the whipped cream,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820
Voila!

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.480
Voila is a French word but we do use it sometimes in American English.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.480
Voila or voila!

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.080
And when we use it in American English, the pronunciation is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.980
changed a little bit so it fits in more with American sounds.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.460
Voila! Voila!

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.940
With that lower American placement.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.160
And it means ‘there it is’, ‘here it is’ and you might say that when you're

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.320
finished with something and you're showing it to people.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.040
Voila! or as some Americans may pronounce it, voila!

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.040
Voila!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.780
And what’s the —— in French?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.800
Peach melba.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.700
Voila!

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.760
- Wow, look at that!
- Bon Appetit!

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.740
I had a Pêche melba in at Rick's Cafe’ in Morocco that was to die for.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.200
That was to die for.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.340
Okay, ‘to die for’. This is an idiom we use when

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.120
something is just exceptional, so good.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.340
We use it a lot with food, tastes:

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.480
Oh, it was to die for! It was so delicious!

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.140
—was to die for!

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.500
Now she does not reduce the word ‘to’

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.780
To die for. She is clearly pronouncing each word

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.720
stressing it, bringing even more emotion in.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.360
So that we understand just how good this Peach Melba was.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.460
And you can reduce that word ‘to’: to die for— to die for—

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.760
We usually reduce the word ‘for’ but we don't hear

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.360
because it's going to be the final word in the thought.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.740
So we don't want to reduce it to fur like we so often do in conversation.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.240
Leave it ‘for’.  To die for.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.500
—was to die for!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.620
-Oh really?
-It was wonderful!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.700
Is that what gave you the idea to make it?

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.760
Is that what gave you? Is that what gave you?

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.060
Notice I dropped the TH in ‘that’

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.100
and connected it to the word before: Is that? Is that?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.560
Is that what gave— Is that what gave—
Is that what gave you the idea to make it?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.560
No, we've been making it got a long time.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.860
Ok, well, there you go, Teresa!

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.580
He made a monster!

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.580
He made a monster!

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.680
What do I mean by that?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.520
We can use the word monster to mean really big.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.100
Have you ever heard of a monster truck?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.280
When I say he made a monster, I mean he made a very big portion of peach melba.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.560
He made a monster!

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.520
 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.020
In Casablanca, in the movie, there is a Rick’s Cafe.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.660
And people kept coming to Morocco—

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.680
And—, and—, there's another word ‘and’ reduced.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.320
The D is dropped. We almost never say the D in the word ‘and’.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.840
And—, and—,  and people kept coming to Morocco!

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.840
Coming to Morocco—

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.280
To Morocco— the word ‘to’ reduced: coming to Morocco.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.200
Coming to Morocco—

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.280
Coming to Morocco and asking for Rick’s Cafe!

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.000
There's another and reduction: —and asking, —and asking.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.260
—and asking, —and asking, —and asking for Rick’s Cafe.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.680
-in Casablanca.
-But Casablanca was filmed in the United States.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.040
So a rich American woman decided she was going to make a Rick’s Cafe.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.120
She was gonna make—, she was gonna make—

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.180
‘Going to’ reduced to ‘gonna’: she was gonna make—

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.620
she was gonna make— she was gonna make— she was gonna make a Rick’s Cafe.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.180
And it's very nice!

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.180
Oh really?

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.180
That's fun!

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.180
Maybe a few more peaches,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.480
actually no, no more peaches.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.260
Actually— actually—.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.100
This word is supposed to be pronounced with the CH sound: actually.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.660
And four syllables: ac-tu-ah-lly.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.660
But you will notice that very often, the CH sound is changed to the SH sound.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.460
This is because we often drop the T when it comes between two other consonants.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.000
So the CH sound changes to the SH sound.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.500
Actually. Actually

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.780
So I'm reducing it to three syllables, this is a common and an easier pronunciation.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.620
I encourage you to try it: ack- shull- lee.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:01.560
So the middle syllable is the SH sound and then the Dark L Shull: shull— shull— shull—

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.520
Actually. Actually.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.060
Actually no— Actually no— Actually no, no more peaches.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.080
-No more peaches.
-Just a little more sauce,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.640
and then, a little cream.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.640
Little, litte, little

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.500
That word’s popping up a lot in this conversation.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.660
A little more, a little less, a little bit.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.980
Just a little more sauce and then a little cream.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.820
I'm getting pretty bossy here, aren't I?

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.440
Pretty with a Flap T. I'm getting pretty bossy.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.600
What does that mean to be bossy?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.200
Notice I'm not saying please or thank you, I'm just telling him what to do.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.060
That's pretty bossy, that's pretty rude.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.280
Luckily, I noticed I was doing it.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.440
I'm getting pretty bossy here, aren't I?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.540
Everyone, this man right here, is my cousin Ken.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.380
His daughter, Luisa, and you've met Stoney before.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.160
Ken, do you have anything you want to say?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.260
-Voila!
-You just want to make faces!

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.460
Wanna make faces. ‘Want to’ reduced to ‘wanna’.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.460
You just want to make faces!

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.840
Also the word ‘just’. I dropped the T there. Why?

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.660
Because it came between two other consonants.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.120
Just want to— just wanna—, just wanna—

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.020
dropping that T between two other consonants

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.760
makes a smoother transition between sounds

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.440
and we love connected speech in American English.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.260
You just wanna— You just wanna— You just want to make faces!

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.880
Thank you so much, John!

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.620
- You're welcome! 
- That looks amazing!

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.400
Delicious!

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.140
Thanks so much to my family for being in this video.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.800
If you're interested in making a Peach Melba, I noticed my good friend Hilah,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.820
over at Hilah cooking, has a recipe.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.880
