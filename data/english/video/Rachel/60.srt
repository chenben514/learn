00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.730
In this American English pronunciation video,
you're going to come on vacation with me and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.009
my family, where we play games, water ski,
and go to the beach. We'll also study some

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.250
American English pronunciation by taking a
look at various reductions, and linking consonant

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.250
to vowel.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.030
This is my uncle Frank
&gt;&gt; Hey!

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.480
Uncle Frank brings his boat every year so
that we can try skiing.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.589
Did you notice the reductions of the word 'that'
and 'can'? These two function words will often

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:45.260
reduce. 'That' becomes thut, with either a
flap or a stop T, depending on the next sound.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.550
And 'can', when not the main verb in the sentence,
becomes kn, kn. So that we can. So that we

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.510
can. So that we can try skiing. 'Try' and
'skiing', the two content words in this sentence,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.030
are clearly much longer than 'so that we can'.
[3x] These four function words are low in

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.570
pitch and very fast. Listen again.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.230
So that we can try skiing. [3x]
Sure appreciate that uncle Frank.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.330
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad to bring it.
Glad to bring it. Here, Frank reduced the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.630
word 'to' to the flap T and the schwa sound: de
de, de, glad de, Glad to bring it. Listen again.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.570
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad to bring it. [3x] This boat
is 17 years old, and I was beginning to wonder

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.030
earlier in the week if I was going to bring
it back again.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.030
Here Frank reduced the phrase 'going to' to
'gonna'. A very common reduction in American

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.650
English. If I was going to bring it back,
gonna, gonna. If I was going to bring it back.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.370
Listen again.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.240
&gt;&gt; I was beginning to wonder earlier in the
week if I was going to bring it back again, [3x]

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.189
but it seems like people are still kind
of interested in skiing, so.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.960
&gt;&gt; We love it.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.659
Love it. Did you hear how I connected the
V sound to the word it? One of the easiest

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.700
ways to link in American English pronunciation,
is the case when one word ends in a consonant

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.280
and the next word begins with a vowel or diphthong.
You can practice the connection between words

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.640
by putting the ending consonant on the next
word: vit, vit, vit, love it, love it, love it.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.910
This will help to eliminate gaps between
words. In American English, we want to link

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.730
all the words in one thought group. Listen
again.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.700
&gt;&gt; We love it. [3x]
&gt;&gt; We'll see if it'll go a couple more years.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.150
&gt;&gt; Yep. I hope it does.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.460
&gt;&gt; So Jace, you going to go skiing today?
Another 'gonna'.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.959
&gt;&gt; You going to go skiing today? [3x]

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am.
&gt;&gt; Have you been before?

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.909
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; This is the first year.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.930
&gt;&gt; Yup.
&gt;&gt; Are you nervous?

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.150
&gt;&gt; Mmm, a little. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It might take a couple tries, so don't

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.550
be discouraged if it doesn't happen right
away.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.700
Right away. Did you notice how I linked the
ending T of 'right' to the beginning vowel

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.000
sound of 'away'. This means that the T comes
between two vowels, so it becomes a flap T,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.140
or, a D sound. So, 'right away' sounds just
like 'ride away'. Listen again.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:34.250
&gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen right away. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Ok, ok, ok. Ok.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.060
&gt;&gt; Meg, are you going to try skiing?
Another 'gonna'. Also notice, I've reduced

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.379
the word 'are' to er, er, er. Listen again.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:50.400
&gt;&gt; Meg, are you going to try skiing? [3x]
&gt;&gt; I don't think so. I tried it when I was

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.790
ten, and I was traumatized because I felt,
and it hurt.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.520
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I think I'm just going to stick to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.959
a bystander.
&gt;&gt; Haley, have you skiied before?

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.870
&gt;&gt; I've done sit skiing before, when I was,
like, six.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.410
&gt;&gt; Wait, yeah, what is that?

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.819
What is. Just like with 'right away', we're
connecting the ending T in 'what' to the beginning

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:19.000
vowel of the word 'is'. So the T turns into a flap
T, or D sound. What is, what is. Listen again.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.860
&gt;&gt; What is that? [3x]
&gt;&gt; It's got the skis

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah?
&gt;&gt; And there's a chair in the middle and you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.950
just sit.
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I've never even heard of that.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.840
Heard of. Another linking consonant to vowel
heard of, heard of. Notice that I am reducing

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.200
the word 'of' to the schwa-V sound: uv, uv,
duv, duv, heard of.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.139
&gt;&gt; I've never even heard of that. [3x]
&gt;&gt; I haven't either.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.400
&gt;&gt; I've done it.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.500
Done it. Another great example of linking
ending consonant to beginning vowel. Done

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.949
it, done it.

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.449
&gt;&gt; I've done it. [3x] So, I'm nervous to do this.
&gt;&gt; I think you'll be just fine.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.870
&gt;&gt; I think so too. I'm ready.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.080
Here, Haley reduced the contraction 'I'm',
to simply the M consonant. I'm ready. Of course,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.050
with that reduction, she linked it to the
next word, mmready. Listen again.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.180
&gt;&gt; I'm ready. [3x]

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.340
This is my cousin Brooke.
&gt;&gt; Brooke, how are you enjoying your vacation?

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.870
&gt;&gt; I'm having a great time on my vacation.
It's a lot of fun.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.920
&gt;&gt; What's the highlight of your vacation so
far?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.680
&gt;&gt; I think the highlight of vacation so far
is spending time with you, Rachel.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.770
&gt;&gt; Oh. That's so sweet.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.039
&gt;&gt; Ani, did you make that necklace?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.320
&gt;&gt; Can you hold it up for me?

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.010
Another reduction of 'can': kn, can you, can
you.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:52.340
&gt;&gt; Can you hold it up for me? [3x]
&gt;&gt; This?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's really pretty.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.120
It's really pretty. A reduction of 'it's'
to the TS sound. It's really, it's really.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.300
&gt;&gt; It's really pretty. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Where'd you make that?

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.759
&gt;&gt; At the craft shop.
&gt;&gt; The craft shop? Let me see?

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:18.000
Have you ever heard someone say 'lemme'? I've
dropped the T in 'let', and connected it to

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.850
'me'. Let me, let me, let me see that.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.410
&gt;&gt; Let me see? [3x]
&gt;&gt; What's it say?

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.830
&gt;&gt; Giggle. Giggle.
&gt;&gt; Giggle? Oh, it does say giggle. That's

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.470
a hard word. It has those gg sounds, and a
dark L. Giggle.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.000
&gt;&gt; Hey Brad.
&gt;&gt; What are you doing? Doing some advertising?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.570
&gt;&gt; We're doing a little advertising, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hey, Rach, I love that shirt. Where did

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.270
you get that?
&gt;&gt; Well, I made it.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.259
Made it. Linking ending consonant to beginning
vowel. Made it.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.710
&gt;&gt; Well, I made it. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Oh, now, what is this?

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.470
&gt;&gt; It says 'I love English' in the International
Phonetic Alphabet.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.020
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, that's so great. Where can
I get one?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:11.379
&gt;&gt; Actually, you can get one right here.
&gt;&gt; RachelsEnglish.com!

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you want to be on my website,
Brad?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.769
Wanna. Here, I use the 'wanna' reduction for
'want to'. Do you wanna.

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:28.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you want to be on my website,
Brad? [3x]   &gt;&gt; Kinda.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:37.110
Kinda. Here, Brad reduced 'kind of' to kinda.
So the word 'of' is pronounced with just the

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.800
schwa, no consonant sound. Kinda.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.560
&gt;&gt; Kinda. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Ok! This is my cousin Brad.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.560
&gt;&gt; Hi!
&gt;&gt; Brad, B-R-A-D, it has the 'aa' as in 'bat'

00:07:52.560 --> 00:08:00.350
vowel. And remember, cousin: spelled with
an S, pronounced, zz, like a Z.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:07.539
Now, it's game time. Here, we'll all tell
the score keeper if we made our bet or not.

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:13.760
Made it. Listen for how we all link those
two words together, made it, no gap.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.219
&gt;&gt; K, who made it?
&gt;&gt; I made it.

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:19.560
&gt;&gt; Roberta.
&gt;&gt; I made it.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.779
&gt;&gt; Rachel.
&gt;&gt; I made it.

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:28.869
&gt;&gt; Made it.

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:34.570
&gt;&gt; Made it.
&gt;&gt; Yes, I also made it.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.009
&gt;&gt; Uncle Dale, did you make that fire?
&gt;&gt; I helped with it, yeah.

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:39.570
&gt;&gt; It's a nice-looking fire.
&gt;&gt; Well thanks.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.000
&gt;&gt; Hey everybody, this is my uncle Dale. He
lives in Texas.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.510
&gt;&gt; Houston, Texas.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.770
I hope that even with just these few snippets
of conversation, you've learned a bit about

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.890
linking consonant to vowel and reductions.
They're an important part to the smoothness

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:03.700
and the rhythm of American English. And as
you can see, they're used all the time in

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:09.560
conversation. Special thanks to my family
for letting me video tape our vacation, and

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:15.850
if you didn't get enough, don't worry. We're
all getting together again at Christmas.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.050
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
