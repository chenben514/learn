00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.980
Hey, happy fourth!

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.720
So, today isn't the fourth but the day that you'll be seeing this is the fourth of July.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.100
So today is the 2nd of July and I'm here with some friends in the park

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.980
and we're gonna talk about what we're doing for the 4th and Fourth of July traditions.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.980
What do you typically do on the fourth of July,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.760
- like the 4th of July is on Tuesday.
-Fireworks.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.060
Fireworks.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.220
Going to see fireworks is a much beloved tradition on the 4th of July in America.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.620
Probably the most common tradition.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.660
A couple years ago, I took you up

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.460
to see the view of the fireworks from the roof of my apartment in Manhattan

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.840
and made a video there. That was a great view.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.180
We're going to see fireworks and then like, usually there's like a family grill out.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.700
Family grill out.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.220
The verb 'grill out'.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.720
This confuses some people because the word 'out' seems like an extra word.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.420
Almost always when you grill, you're grilling outside.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
Certainly, he could've dropped the word but he said grill out

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.100
which is similar to cookout

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700
which implies that the food is being cooked and eaten outside.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.960
Usually, you invite people over for this. It's a  little bit of a party.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.760
So a grill out is where you do this with a grill.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.300
He definitely could've just said: We're going to grill.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.480
Or he could've said: We're going to have a cookout.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.460
But some people do use the term grill out.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.440
Usually, there's like a family grill out.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.700
Family grill out.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.860
But that was before I had my own family.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.680
Yeah. So what do you do now?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.800
Uhm. Now, I'm not sure. We're new to the starting traditions.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.480
No fireworks though, right?

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.300
I heard they scare babies.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.560
--We might go to fireworks. Probably not this year.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.940
Did you notice how he pronounced the word 'probably'?

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.740
He reduced it to something more like pry--
 pry not--

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.680
But pry not this year: Pry-- pry--

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.880
Americans really reduce this word.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.560
You can say probly, prolly, or pry.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.360
He doesn't even really make an L sound.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.960
I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a non-native speaker.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.900
But you will hear native speakers do this.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.640
Pry not this year. Pry not. Pry not. Pry not.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.000
- We might go to fireworks. Probably not this year.
- Really?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.220
- Yeah. We're not going to try this year either.
- Eventually. Eventually, we'll go to fireworks.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.440
Fireworks really scare dogs. We need to take care of him.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.400
So you guys have no idea what you'll do on Tuesday? Do you have off?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.140
Do you have off means have you been given the day off at work?

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.020
As in for a holiday in this case.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.300
Do you have off?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.660
I do have off. We might do some grilling. We'll see friends.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.200
But uh, it's to be determined.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.060
Yeah.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.480
To be determined.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.180
This is a phrase you can use for something that's not yet certain.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.540
We're definitely leaving tomorrow but I don't know the time yet.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.240
It's to be determined.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.420
But uh, It's to be determined.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.820
Yeah.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.920
We might try to go one of these state parks with like a swimming beach lake in New Jersey.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.060
-- That sounds pretty cool.
-- I just feel like,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.180
for me, I want a body of water involved in my 4th of July plans.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.840
A body of water refers to something like an ocean, lake,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.280
maybe a spring, sea, pond, that kind of thing.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.280
For me, I want a body of water involved in my 4th of July plans.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.980
That sounds like a good plan to me.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.020
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.160
I don't know.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.660
-- Find a place to swim.
-- Yeah.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.760
It's just hard with the nap time. Don't you hate it when your life gets ruined by naptime?

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.000
Dave and I both have babies about the same age, a little over a year.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.200
And I know for us, we want to keep our baby on a schedule because we think it makes life easier.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
But at the same time, it kind of makes life harder.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.700
Yeah. It's just hard with the nap time.
Don't you hate it when your life gets ruined by naptime?

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.240
You guys haven't made that happen yet, right? You guys are still flexible.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.400
Nope. We are pretty flexible.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.600
Yeah.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.080
Our son pretty much dictates when everyone is to fall asleep.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.320
We still live and die by a schedule.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.040
- We're not very scheduled.
- Yeah.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.440
Besides our own work schedule.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.200
- Pros and cons to both approaches.
- Yeah!

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.760
Pros and cons.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.780
This is a way to discusss and talk about things that are positive about a situation

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.740
and things that are negative about a situation.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.560
For example, if someone's having a hard time making a decision, sometimes, the advice is:

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.660
Why don't you write out at list of pros and cons?

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.580
He started talking about traditions again so I turned the camera back on.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:59.320
Where I grew up in Lancaster, there was always a bunch of fireworks done by each like little borough.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.920
Vocabulary word: borough.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.720
A borough is a town or district incorporated within the US.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.100
So here, he's talking about Lancaster which is a country.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.880
And within that county, there would be Lancaster city but there are also lots of little boroughs.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:26.840
Also in New York city, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island are called The 5 Boroughs.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.560
A bunch of fireworks done by each like little borough.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.340
So there would be days of fireworks around the 4th of July.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.580
What do you mean days? Like entire days where there was like a fireworks

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.940
-- in 2, 3...
-- No, there would be like the 3rd,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.640
-- the 4th, 5th..
-- Yeah. Right.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.440
Depending on if it's on a weekend.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.620
But like you can go to a like couple consecutive nights of fireworks.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.840
Yeah.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.820
Vocabulary word: consecutive.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.580
This means following continuously or right in a row.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.620
An unbroken sequence.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.080
So 'on 2 consecutive days' means 1 day right after the other.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.080
No extra days in between.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.580
-- to a like couple consecutive nights of fireworks.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.040
So did you ever?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.000
Sometimes, we would. Uhm, the biggest one was in Lancaster County Park

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.800
where there actually had an orchestra

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.020
-- as well. 
-- Oh, nice!

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.760
That's-- where I grew up in Gainesville, there was like an outdoor amphitheater.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.240
Vocabulary word: amphitheater.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.080
This is a building, usually an outdoor building, often without a roof,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.540
rounded, semi-circular,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.560
used for the presentation of musical events or maybe some drama.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.180
There can also be tiers of seating.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:58.700
--in Gainesville, there was like an outdoor amphitheater with some pops band doing stuff and some fireworks.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.900
That was every year. Never strayed from that. Picnic and fireworks.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.140
Yeah, that was like the biggest one.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.140
There are definitely places like that in Philly, right?

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.920
We're just not going cause we have babies.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.080
-- Right.
-- Yeah.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.060
They-- in Philly, they set up at the art museum.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.060
Oh yeah!

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.520
And they do really big firework production

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.800
with even, there's always like some live band.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.620
I'm not sure who it is this year though.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.360
Okay.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.020
-- I think The Roots did it one year.
-- Really?

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.940
Well maybe next year when the kids are older, we'll all go together.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.420
-- That sounds good to me.
-- That'll be fun!

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.280
Huge thanks to my friend, Dave, for being in this video.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.300
That's it guys! Thanks so much for using Rachel's English!
