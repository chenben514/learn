00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Hey guys! Welcome to dinner.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.460
Thanks for having dinner with us.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.500
We had this idea to do a video about American English conversation with our family at dinner,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.940
and then we thought, that's a terrible idea, because we have a baby and a toddler.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.220
So I said, why don't we just sit down to dinner?

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.760
And then I started seeing about this thing called a mukbang.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.100
 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.440
And so we're kind of doing that, kind of not, mostly, we're just eating dinner with you,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.620
and we're going to turn it into an English conversation lesson. So whenever we're talking,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.780
and some phrasal verb or idiom or vocabulary word comes up, that I think you might not know,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.520
or that I want to explain, you'll see it on screen in red, red and white text, and then at the end of the video,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.480
I’m going to sit down, we're going to go over all of these terms. So, let's start.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.200
Cheers, David!

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.820
Cheers.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.340
&gt;&gt; Cheers everybody.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for joining me at dinner.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.420
Now David's being a really good sport by 
joining me here.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.740
As you can see, we only have one plate of 
food, and it's huge.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.140
So I was reading an article about eating on YouTube,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.000
and it was talking about this thing that they called a mukbang,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.740
which is, I’m doing an English pronunciation of it, but the origin is two Korean words put together.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.100
But basically, people were making videos of themselves eating and then

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.360
posting that, and people were eating with them, so they wouldn't feel like they're eating alone.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.120
And then it kind of turned into this thing where people were binging on mass amounts of food,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.420
and that's kind of what we're doing.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.600
Seems like a great idea to me.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.660
Yeah. When I told David I wanted to do this, he got really excited

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.380
because he loves binging on mass amounts of food.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.100
Now, obviously we're not going to finish this, right?

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.640
We'll see.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.840
Okay, but the thing about it is, I’ve watched a few mukbang videos,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.520
it involves one huge plate of food, multiple people eating off of it, mouth noises are encouraged,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.820
sloppy eating is encouraged.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.380
Wow.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.080
So feel free.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.020
Um, and let's just dig in and see... See what happens.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.220
You say what you're eating?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.600
Yeah, I guess we do.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.920
Okay, so we got carryout from a local indian restaurant, we have samosas, we have naan,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.380
a big pile of rice underneath, and then some saag paneer, and some chicken tikka masala.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.600
And I’m vegetarian, mostly.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.420
I eat almost no meat, except I do eat this chicken tikka masala because it's...

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.020
&gt;&gt; ...that good.
&gt;&gt; that's how good it is.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.440
All right, so I’m actually, I feel embarrassed to start.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.940
I don't.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.400
Okay, I’m going to let you start then. I’m just going to have another sip of wine.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.180
I'm hungry.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.020
While I think about getting ready to eat in front of the camera.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.540
So good.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.340
I know. We know. This food is so good that's why we decided to get this.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.260
It's unbelievable.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.880
We were like if there's anything that we 
can eat a ton of, it's this.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.340
So anyway, David you've been watching a few of these mukbang videos, right?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.540
Yeah.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.140
What do you think?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.340
What do I think of the idea?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.120
You know, I have my elbow on the table.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.440
&gt;&gt; that's actually like...
&gt;&gt; that's not okay.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.280
Considered bad manners.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.420
Especially when I’m trying to get out a huge plate of food.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.140
Let me take it off.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.980
So what did you...well, first of all, the thing I love about YouTube is niches can flourish.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.480
Yeah.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.600
Right? I mean most people would not have thought a video of someone eating a meal

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.280
would be that big of a deal.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.260
'Cause it's ridiculous.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.520
But people love it, like, these videos have millions of views. Okay, I’m going to take my first bite.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.940
Oh. That reminds me.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.920
 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.500
I’ve been having problems with my jaw lately.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.360
I can't open it that much, and I, I got the first part of a root canal yesterday,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.620
finally, after like, months of pain and different dentist appointments.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.660
 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.560
Going to have it finished next week, so that's that makes it extra awkward to try to eat on camera,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.920
when you can barely open your mouth.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.580
Like, I open my mouth and not enough and food falls off my fork because I was not able to open my jaw enough.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.340
So I’m going to take a little bites.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.440
Messy eating.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.800
A little messy.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.780
Anyway, what I was saying was, that's what's so great about YouTube is that

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:44.120
there's so much content there that even something that seems like almost no one would watch it,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.740
there are still millions of people to watch it.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.260
And it was interesting, some people were talking about

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.420
they had like loss of appetite due to various problems in their lives,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:04.580
and that watching these videos of people really loving food, kind of help them get their appetite back.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.260
I could see it going the other way, too. But no, I’m glad it worked for them.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.320
I can see it going the other way as well.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.300
Also, I noticed there seems to be a disproportionate amount of mukbangs on seafood.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.160
Oh yeah, I noticed that too. No, thanks.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.980
&gt;&gt; I think it's partly because...
&gt;&gt; maybe how it started...

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.640
That food, like, there's a lot of slurping, with crab legs and mussels and stuff.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.560
Part of it is like, the sound, people like the sound.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.020
Is this one mint?

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.240
Hmm mm.  Isn't it?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.020
&gt;&gt; What would you say?
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.760
Yeah. Herb, general herb.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:51.040
I was just doing a video on silent letters, herb.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.860
I think they say the H in British English.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.400
But we don't in American English. Isn't that funny?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.440
Samosa got cold. Shame.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.360
Shame that.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.840
David went to go get more water.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.060
More wine, too.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.640
That's got to be a nice sound. I guess I’ll 
have a little more.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.300
For the past 3 weeks, I’ve been so doped 
up on pain killers,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.380
that I’ve not been having any wine or 
anything to drink ever.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.520
And today is the first day. 
Wait, did I take some this morning?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.180
 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.920
&gt;&gt; not wine.
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.780
I did. So today's the first day I haven't had pain killers.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.700
&gt;&gt; cheers.
&gt;&gt; cheers to that.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:40.420
And yeah I did take it this morning, I mean I’ve been taking it every four hours, and still hurting all the time.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.560
When he was digging in...

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.460
Oh, man!

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.560
I know. He said it was worse than... Worse than average, way worse than average. What?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.920
Meal conversation.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.740
It's fine. It's a root canal. It's not gross.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.860
 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.840
A little bit.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.740
Not really.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.740
 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.220
The naan is so good.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.120
 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.120
I thought you didn't usually care for the naan,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.860
No, it's not that I don't care for it. I usually don't have room for it.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.080
Oh, that's fair.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.580
Also, we only get one. Stoney loves it.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.740
Right. He eats most of it.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.480
You love it so I’m like okay, I’ll back off, I’ll let these people eat their naan.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.840
Alright.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.280
Whereas if you were going to try to eat my samosa, I would be like, no.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.760
Oh yeah, I know that.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.140
You may not.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.340
Okay, here's a story David and I had not been dating for very long, and we took a trip.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.320
Yeah.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.440
We went to Montreal with some friends and we went out to a kind of nice dinner.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:55.640
And they brought all these small plates but it was a small plates kind of place. And one of them was kimchi.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:04.260
And I had it sitting there on my plate for a long time because I wasn't sure yet what I wanted to eat it with.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.300
I was saving it and David really casually takes his fork

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.580
and just like about to stab it to take it for himself because he's like 'this woman doesn't want this

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.480
kimchi 'cause it's just sitting on her plate'.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.600
Luckily, I had my hand here, and it went

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.420
 

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.800
It was just like cat-like reflexes. I saw his fork going in, and I went--

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.800
&gt;&gt; Yep, you did.
&gt;&gt; And I said: I’m saving that.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.220
So he knows. Certain foods...

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.680
Don't mess.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.700
Don't take Rachel's portion.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.320
We got a lot of work to do here.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.020
Leftovers.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.840
Tomorrow night's dinner.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.720
All right. Well, I can stop.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.220
All right.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.260
We'll wrap it up.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.320
And I’m going to have a lot of fun going through and watching this,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.120
and picking all those words that we're going to use, so guys don't go anywhere because right now,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.020
we're going to have the lesson that goes with this conversation.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.180
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.540
Ok, the first word up was ‘mukbang’.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:17.900
We talked about this a little. It’s a genre of online video where people record themselves eating a meal.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.620
The word is derived from the Korean words for eating and broadcast.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.640
What did you think of this format? Was it gross watching us eat? Was it fun?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.460
Did you feel like you were sitting at our dinner table?

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.320
&gt;&gt; Cheers, David.
&gt;&gt; Cheers!

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.340
The next word was ‘cheers’.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.140
There’s a good chance you know this is the word we toast with in American English.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.700
I have a longer video lesson on that topic, which I’ll link to at the end of this video,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.580
you can see the link in the video description.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.820
It’s used to express good wishes.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:56.520
In the UK, you can also use it not just in a toast but when you’re parting ways with someone.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.100
See you, cheers.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.060
That's not at all common in the US.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.060
A cheer is also a showing of support from a crowd, like at a sporting event.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.700
[crowd cheering]

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.040
Then of course we have a cheerleader, whose job it is to get the crowd excited.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.980
Now, David's being a really good sport by joining me here.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.800
A 'good sport' is someone who can remain positive when something goes wrong,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.840
or agree to do something that he or she might not really want to do.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:34.680
I thought David was being a good sport by joining me in my idea to eat dinner on camera, but really, he enjoyed it.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.760
But basically, people were making videos of themselves eating and then posting that.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.340
And people were eating with them so they don't feel like they were eating alone.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.220
And then it kind of turned into this thing where people were binging on mass amounts of food

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.800
&gt;&gt; and that's kind of what we're doing.
&gt;&gt; Seems like a great idea to me.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.800
Binging on mass amounts of food.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.520
So the word to 'binge' means to do something in excess for a short period of time.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.860
We use it with the preposition ‘on’; you can binge on food or alcohol.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.620
As I said in the video, in mukbangs, people binge on a mass amount of food.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:16.460
Mass, a large number, a large amount. You could say, she has a mass following.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.520
She has a massive amount of followers.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.740
With binge, aside from food or drink, we also use it with TV. Binge watching.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:32.120
With streaming programs, you can now watch all of the episodes of a season of a show, or the whole series.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.940
You used to have to wait every week for one half-hour show to come out.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.380
But now with these services like Netflix, you can binge-watch Friends.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:46.540
You can log on and watch episode after episode all weekend. What did you do last weekend?

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.940
I binge-watched Friends.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.040
Or you might hear someone describe a show as binge-worthy.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.400
That means it’s worth it to spend all weekend watching that show.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.220
Let's just dig in and see...see what happens.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.240
&gt;&gt; When he was digging in...
&gt;&gt; Oh, man!

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.900
I know. He said it was worse than...worse than average.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.220
Dig in.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.860
Now, in the course of this conversation, we used this phrase two really different ways.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.980
Let's just dig in and see...see what happens.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.340
We used it to describe eating. To dig means to start eating. Go ahead, dig in.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.420
&gt;&gt; When he was digging in...
&gt;&gt; Oh, man!

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.740
I know. He said it was worse than...worse than average.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.120
But we also use it to talk about something sharp, penetrating something.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:44.760
We use it with fingernails. You’re digging into my arm. Or, the back of my shoe is digging into my heel.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.700
I used to talk about the dentist digging into my gum.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.760
When he was digging in...

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.820
Oh, man!

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.260
I know. He said it was worse than...worse than average.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:01.120
There’s a third way we use it, and that means to mentally prepare to work through a hard situation

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.980
or do some hard work.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.220
For example, if there’s something at work that you really don’t want to work on, you could say,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:14.820
This project is going to be so much work, but I need to just dig in and do it. Dig in.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.360
Okay, so, we got carry-out.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.600
Carry out. This is different from delivery. For carry out, you call the restaurant to order, or you order it online,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.540
and then you go pick it up.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.200
I don’t feel like cooking. Let’s get carry out.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.680
And I’m vegetarian. Mostly.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.060
A vegetarian is someone who doesn’t eat meat.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:41.860
I call myself vegetarian, but if I eat chicken every once in a while, come on Rachel, you’re not a vegetarian.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:50.480
This is a five-syllable word with stress on the middle syllable. Vege-tar-ian. Vegetarian.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.280
In the word ‘vegetable’, we drop the second E. VEG-table.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:03.260
But in ‘vegetarian’, we do say it. 
Vege-- It’s the schwa. Vegetarian.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.240
If there's anything we can eat a ton of, it's this.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.240
A ton. A very common term to mean ‘a lot’.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:17.180
It’s interchangeable with ‘tons’. It’s a huge company, they have tons of employees.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.760
Or, it’s a huge company, they have a ton of employees.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.280
A ton of. Tons of.  You know what, I have 
my elbow on the table.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.560
&gt;&gt; That's actually like...
&gt;&gt; That's not okay.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.340
Considered bad manners.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.480
Especially when I’m trying to get out a huge plate of food.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.140
Let me take it off.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.080
Manners.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.040
This is your way of being.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.740
We usually use the adjectives ‘good’ and ‘bad’ with it.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:45.000
As the parent of a young child, I’m definitely in the middle of trying to teach good manners.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.380
Good manners at the table, like ‘don’t talk 
with your mouth full’;

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:54.360
or good manners when meeting 
someone, like ‘make eye contact.’ Manners.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:00.620
Well, first of all, the thing I love about YouTube is niches can flourish.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:06.540
Niches can flourish. There are two different pronunciations that you’ll hear for 'niche'.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:15.320
It can be ‘niche’ or ‘niche’. Both are in the dictionary, both are okay. A niche is a specialized segment.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:22.660
So not general, something that applies to a lot of people, but niche. Something more narrow and focused.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:29.260
For example, I don’t teach English as a Second Language, I focus on the niche of pronunciation.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:35.320
Well, first of all, the thing I love about YouTube is niches can flourish.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.220
I also used the word ‘flourish’ there.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.360
Flourish means to grow, develop, thrive, be healthy.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.500
Children flourish in a health and positive environment. Her business is flourishing.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.500
And I got the first part of a root canal yesterday.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.100
Root canal. Have you had one? I’ve 
learned a lot about them recently.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.980
This is a procedure to remove inflamed tissue around the root of a tooth.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.600
Not comfortable.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.640
That makes it extra awkward to try to eat on camera.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:14.460
Awkward. I like the spelling of this word. The first W goes with the letter A to make the AW vowel, aw.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.660
Awkward.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:25.180
The second W is a W sound. AWK-wwww. Awkward. Here, meaning embarrassing. Awkward.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:30.380
They had, like, loss of appetite due to various problems in their lives.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:37.540
Appetite is hunger, your desire for food. Some medications can cause a loss of appetite.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:44.960
I remember once when one of my boyfriends broke up with me, I was so sad, and I had no appetite for weeks.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.460
Appetite.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:52.180
I notice there seems to be a disproportionate amount of mukbangs on seafood.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.760
Disproportionate. A longer word, five syllables, with middle syllable stress.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.160
It means a number that is too large or too 
small in context.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.200
I said there is a disproportionate number of mukbang videos on seafood.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.820
It seems like there are a lot of these videos on seafood compared to how much a person actually eats seafood.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.620
That food, like, there's a lot of slurping, with crab legs and mussels and stuff.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:27.380
Slurping. Sluuurp! Speaking of manners, it’s considered bad manners in the US to make a lot of noise while eating,

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:33.160
like slurping. In some countries, it’s no problem but in the US, it’s a no-no.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.600
Herb, general herb.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:45.240
Herb. Herbal. Silent H, R vowel. Rrrrb. herb. In British English, they do say the H

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.260
and they pronounce the vowel differently, 
without the R sound.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:57.460
herb.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.920
Herb in American English.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.360
Samosa got cold. Shame.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:10.640
‘Shame’ or ‘it’s a shame’ is something you say to show disappointment. Our local coffee shop shut down.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:17.540
It’s a shame, I loved going there. But it’s also used in the phrase ‘shame on you’, which is very different.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:22.800
If someone thinks you should feel shame, feel bad about something you’ve done or said.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:29.620
Or you could say I’m ashamed – that means you feel bad, terrible, about something you did.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:35.060
You needed help, and I didn’t help you, 
and I’m ashamed about that.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.700
For the past 3 weeks, I’ve been so doped up on pain killers.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:46.780
'Doped up' means to have a lot of drugs, sometimes to the point where it interferes with you acting normally.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.680
I was taking the maximum amount of pain killers every four hours.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:59.680
Pain killers: Tylenol, Advil, Motrin, or the ingredients, acetemetaphin or ibuprofen.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.740
I thought you don't usually care for naan.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.700
No, it's not that I don't care for it. I usually don't have room for it.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.260
Care for. This is another way to say ‘like’ or ‘enjoy’.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.380
I don’t care for sweets is another way to 
say I don’t like sweets.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.380
So I’m like, Okay, I’ll back off. 
I’ll let these people eat their naan.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.460
Alright.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.520
Back off.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.480
Stop doing what you’re doing a move 
away, or to not touch something.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:29.620
Since Stoney and David like naan better than I do, I just back off and let them have it.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.800
Okay, here's a story. 
David and I had not been dating for very long.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.920
Dating. This is what we call it when you are becoming romantically involved with someone.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:45.020
Are they in a serious relationship? No, they're just dating. Or, she was dating three people at once.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.380
They brought all these small plates, it was a small plates kinds of place.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:55.120
Small plates. This refers to the style of dining where rather than everybody getting their own meal,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.140
there are small portions, you order a lot, 
and everyone shares.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.900
Everyone at the table just has a bite or two of each thing.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.660
One of them was kimchi.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:11.260
Kimchi, pickled, fermented vegetables, a Korean dish that David and I both really love.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.100
It was just like, cat-like reflexes. I saw his 
fork going in and I went--

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:22.540
Have you heard this phrase before? If someone has cat-like reflexes, it means they react very quickly.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.320
Maybe you catch something that someone else has dropped before it hits the floor.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.940
They might say, Wow! you have cat-like reflexes.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.520
We got a lot of work to do here.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.340
Leftovers.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:40.420
Leftovers. I don’t mind eating leftovers for days, but David hates eating the same thing over and over.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.240
What do you think? Are you a leftover person?

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.800
Well, I can stop.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.300
Alright.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.440
We'll wrap it up.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.360
To 'wrap it up' means to conclude something.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:55.100
If Stoney is playing at a playground, I might say, Stoney, we need to wrap it up and head out.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.380
Stop doing this, and leave. Wrap it up.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.920
Guys, thanks for having dinner with us. If you want to see a video where we're having a meal with our kids,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.300
it's a little more chaotic,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:11.940
check out the My Morning Routine video where we had breakfast with the baby and the toddler.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.140
That video is right here, and please subscribe. We make new videos every Tuesday,

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.580
I love teaching you English.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.340
Thank you for spending your time with me.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.280
That's it and thanks so much for using Rachel's English.
