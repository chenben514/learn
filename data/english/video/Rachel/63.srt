00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.780
&gt;&gt; Sara, where are we going?
&gt;&gt; We're going to Coney Island!

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.450
In this American English pronunciation video,
you'll come with me and some friends to Coney

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.450
Island, and study some American English pronunciation
in real life.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.190
&gt;&gt; There's a special trick about the word
'island', pronunciation-wise. Can you tell

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.070
me what it is?
&gt;&gt; Well, there's an S in it, but you don't

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.320
really pronounce it in the word 'island'.
&gt;&gt; It's silent.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.210
&gt;&gt; That's right. It is silent.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:52.579
Other examples of words with a silent S: aisle,
debris, and two state names: Arkansas, and

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.989
Illinois.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.360
In this video you'll hear English conversation.
A few specific topics that I'll point out

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.790
for study: first, the ending, unaccented EE
sound. My students whose native languages

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.270
are Russian and Polish often have difficulty
with the ending, unaccented EE sound. It tends

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.600
to be too relaxed, and turns into a sound like
'ih'. For example, the word 'many' will be

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.200
pronounced men-ih, men-ih: too relaxed and
spread. Many, ee, ee, ee. So, the trick is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.479
to keep the tongue position very high. Many,
many. Words with the ending unaccented EE

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:51.670
sound in this video: many, Coney, fatty, scary,
city. Notice that two of those words, 'fatty'

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.920
and 'city', have a flap T. That is, a T coming
between two vowel sounds, so it's pronounced

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.879
like a D sound. Fatty, city. We'll also study
some reduction: 'em for the word 'them', 'er

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:20.000
for the word 'her', ts for the word 'it's',
and 'cuz' for the word 'because'.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.489
&gt;&gt; There are many, many stops before Coney
Island. Sara, how long do we have yet?

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:37.509
&gt;&gt; At least 45 minutes.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I love New York City. Don't you?

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:43.900
&gt;&gt; You can see here, Coney Island is in south
Brooklyn. It's on the Atlantic and has a wide,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.959
sandy beach, and also a boardwalk. From my
home in Manhattan, it's about an hour's ride

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.550
on the subway. There's also a park with roller
coasters.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.550
&gt;&gt; Say something to the Rachel's English audience!
&gt;&gt; AHH! This is crazy!

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.090
&gt;&gt; How was it?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:29.400
&gt;&gt; Which one did you like best?
&gt;&gt; Uh, I liked that one better.
0:03:29.400,0:03:23.859
&gt;&gt; Why?
&gt;&gt; Uh, this was too fast for me. And I felt,

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.239
it was just kind of weird. That was like I
was flying. It was fun.

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.239
&gt;&gt; You were flying.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that one was better, because it was

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.510
longer and you felt like you were flying.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:40.059
Because it was longer. Here Megan has reduced
the word 'because' to simply 'cuz', 'cuz'.

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:46.939
Of course, when we reduce, we always want
to link. Cuz it, cuz it, cuz it was longer.

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:55.109
Cuz it was, cuz it was. Notice how those three
words, unstressed, less important, are low

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:02.109
in pitch and flatter compared to the adjective,
the content word, the stressed word, 'longer',

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:13.000
which is longer in length, a little louder,
and had more shape. Cuz it was longer [2x]

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.249
&gt;&gt; Cuz it was longer [3x] and you felt like
you were flying.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.159
&gt;&gt; No! I don't like it, I don't like it, I
don't like it!

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:45.060
&gt;&gt; Never going to do it again.
&gt;&gt; She is a blast.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.310
&gt;&gt; Scary.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.150
But not as scary as this. Don't worry, I didn't
try this one.

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.699
&gt;&gt; We want funnel cake, but we don't know
if we can use our tickets!

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.939
&gt;&gt; Ah! The frustration! Why don't you just
ask her?

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:11.530
It's common practice in English to drop the
H in words like 'her', 'his', 'him'. So, 'her'

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:18.110
becomes 'er', 'er'. Make sure that you link
this to the word before: ask her, ask her,

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.809
just ask her. This smoothes out the language
and sounds more natural.

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:28.000
&gt;&gt; Why don't you just ask her? [3x]

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.330
&gt;&gt; It's okay, I can get it in that place.
&gt;&gt; You just said 'tsokay'! I taught a lesson

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.949
on that once, not too long ago.
&gt;&gt; Oh perfect!

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:43.569
Tsokay. Here, Janae reduced the word 'it's'
to simply 'ts', 'ts'. As always, when you

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.529
reduce, you have to link. Tsokay, tsokay.

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.259
&gt;&gt; It's okay [3x], I can get it in that place.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:06:01.889
&gt;&gt; The famous Coney Island boardwalk. With
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.059
&gt;&gt; Tim, how are your Dippin' Dots?
&gt;&gt; They're great.

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.090
&gt;&gt; I've never had them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've never had them either.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:17.090
Did you notice how Tim and I both reduced
the word 'them' to 'em, 'em. Of course, we

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:24.560
also linked that word to the word before:
had 'em, had 'em, had 'em.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:32.000
&gt;&gt; I've never had them. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've never had them either. [3x]

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.199
&gt;&gt; They kind of melt together.
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.409
&gt;&gt; And then they just become this gelatinous
mass.

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.650
&gt;&gt; Let me see?
&gt;&gt; Look at that.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.070
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.070
&gt;&gt; I'm just kidding, I love it. Here's the
thing. I forgot that I'm sort of afraid of

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.800
heights. And then I got on the Ferris Wheel,
and my friends made me get on the car that

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.520
swings back and forth, and you never know
quite when it's going to start swinging again.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.000
Um, I'm holding on to the side, just...
&gt;&gt; WOAH!!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:12.370
&gt;&gt; ...just to prepare for the swing. I also
get motion sickness, so. It's a bit much.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.960
&gt;&gt; Oh wow!

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:22.169
Again, reducing the word 'it's' to simply
'ts'. Tsa bit much. Tsa bit much.

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:28.240
&gt;&gt; It's a bit much. [3x]

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:35.240
After the Wonder Wheel, we still went on a
few more rides and did bumper cars. Then we

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:41.180
went to Nathan's on the boardwalk and ate
a bunch of hot dogs and fried food. We felt

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.789
pretty gross, but we really still wanted to
try funnel cakes.

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:54.090
&gt;&gt; What is a funnel cake, Kayon?
&gt;&gt; Well. Funnel, beginning with F ... is a

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.590
delicious treat eaten at the beach.
&gt;&gt; But what is it? Why is it called funnel

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.969
cake?
&gt;&gt; Cuz of the way they make it.

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:07.059
Did you notice? Another 'cuz'. Cuz of the
way, cuz of the way they make it.

00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:12.460
&gt;&gt; Cuz of the way they make it. [3x] They put the
dough in a funnel

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.789
&gt;&gt; ...and it's runny...
&gt;&gt; And they go around like this.

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:16.830
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; All different ways.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.650
&gt;&gt; They do that in what?
&gt;&gt; A fryer.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.300
&gt;&gt; Some oil.
&gt;&gt; It's a deep fryer.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.020
&gt;&gt; How's it taste?
&gt;&gt; Tastes like dough-nuts.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.550
&gt;&gt; How's this one taste, Linds? Pretty good?
&gt;&gt; It's delicious.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:38.819
&gt;&gt; I might need some.
&gt;&gt; Yum.

00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:43.300
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's delicious.
&gt;&gt; Dee-licious.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.779
Before we headed home, we were able to catch
the fire works that they were setting off

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:54.050
at the stadium next door because of the minor
league baseball game. It was the perfect ending

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.240
to a great night.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:02.220
&gt;&gt; You guys tired?
&gt;&gt; I think we're mostly tired because we ate

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.410
fatty food.
&gt;&gt; We did eat fatty, fatty food.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:13.880
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
