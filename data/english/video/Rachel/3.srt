00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
Are we there yet?

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.900
Today we’ll study phrases and idioms and we’ll do a little listening comprehension quiz

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.080
as we study conversation that came up on a road trip I took with my two kids,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.240
my husband, and our friend Steve.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.600
 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.780
Alright, let m buckle up.
Did everybody buckle up?

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.780
Yup!

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.000
&gt;&gt; Steve?
&gt;&gt; We're buckled in.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.080
I did buckle up.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.920
Buckle up – that’s a phrasal verb that 
means to put on your seatbelt.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.580
I noticed with my kids’ car seats, sometimes I use the phrase buckle in.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.960
Hold still so I can buckle you in. Then I’ll buckle up.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.160
Did everybody buckle up?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.700
Yup!

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.000
&gt;&gt; Steve?
&gt;&gt; We're buckled in.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760
I did buckle up.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.280
Buckle up, buckle down.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.940
The meaning of the phrase buckle down is completely unrelated.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.580
It means to really focus on something, to work hard on it.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.600
I need to buckle down and study for this exam.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.680
I don’t feel like doing my homework.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.420
Just buckle down and get it done.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.320
Now, about 4 minutes into the car ride, Stoney started asking if he could watch a video.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.400
He knows he gets to watch one with his headphones when Sawyer needs to take his nap,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.460
to help keep the car quiet.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.300
The next 20 seconds of video won’t have subtitles, so see if you can understand what we’re saying.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.640
There’s going to be a one-question quiz at the end of the 20 seconds:  How long is the car ride?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:50.620
 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.360
Ok, do you know the answer?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.660
How long is the car ride?  David said it once, more clearly, and then I repeated it, less clearly, I said it faster.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.720
Two hundred and seventy one, that's all.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.740
So 271 miles. So that's why we're going to 
be driving after lunch.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.060
271 miles.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.620
Oh, I hope this slow down doesn't last too long.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.900
One thing you hope you never have on a roadtrip with two small children is a delay.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.480
I hope we don't hit many delays.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.340
The GPS says that it's clear sailing. Knock on wood, it'll stay that way.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.500
Okay, clear sailing. Knock on wood, guys.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.740
David used two phrases there. ‘Clear 
sailing’ and ‘knock on wood’.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.840
'Clear sailing’, we use this not just with sailing, but also driving to mean nothing in the way, no obstacles,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.100
nothing to delay us on a trip.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.040
But we also use it in general to mean no problems or obstacles with a situation.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.700
It doesn’t just have to be transportation. It could be with something like completing a project.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.560
For example, now that we got the new budget approved, it should be clear sailing to finish the project.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.980
That is, we foresee no problems, no issues, and no obstacles arising.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.660
The other phrase he used was ‘knock on wood’.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.920
Both of these phrases are really common. 
Have you heard them before?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.080
'Knock on wood' is a superstitious expression.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.960
If you comment out loud on something that’s going well, you might say ‘knock on wood’

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.560
as a way to say: And I hope things keep going well.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.000
I hope my having mentioned it doesn’t mean it ends!  For example, Hey Rachel, how’s the baby sleeping?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.140
He sleeps through the night, knock on wood.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.720
I’ve run out of gas more than once on a road trip.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.700
Actually, years ago, I made a video on another road trip where I did run out of gas.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.300
I’ll link to that video at the end of this video, there’s a lot to learn about American English in that lesson.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.760
David and I have also run out of gas on a road trip before.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.960
Run out is a phrasal verb with more than one meaning.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.040
It can mean to do an errand that won’t take very long.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.100
Can you run out and get some milk? Or, I’m going to run out and pick up the kids from school.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.160
But it also means to deplete something, to have nothing left. I ran out of time, I couldn’t finish the test.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.480
We ran out of gas on the highway.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.760
So now, I pay more attention to how much gas we have.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.700
How we doin' on gas?

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.340
 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.740
Just over 3 quarters.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.360
 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.640
How we doing on.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.840
I dropped the word ‘are’ there.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.880
This is somewhat common in casual English after ‘how’.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.160
How you doing?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.580
How we doing on gas?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.900
How we doing on time?

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.680
How we doin' on gas?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.640
Have you ever taken a road trip with two small kids?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.740
So, Stoney's asking when we're getting out of the car. How long have we been in the car?

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.220
We've been in the car for about 12 minutes.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.420
&gt;&gt; Ten?
&gt;&gt; Ten minutes.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.540
We have about 5 hours.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.120
5 hours?
&gt;&gt;Mmhmm.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.180
&gt;&gt;Yup.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.340
 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.560
It can get long.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.640
But really, the boys did great.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.020
Some of you have asked about English books, videos, songs, and so on to expose your kids to English.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.500
One thing that Stoney loves to do is to listen to audiobooks.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.660
So now is a great time to talk about Audible who has so kindly sponsored this video.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.020
I've really gotten into audiobooks lately and they do have a selection for kids.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.500
You can choose by age so Stoney's just 3, and there are so many fun audiobooks.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.240
Stoney, what are we listening to?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.920
Laurie Berkner.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.820
Do you like it?

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.040
Yeah!

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.980
The one we listened to in the car was Laurie Berkner's song and story kitchen.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.980
If you have young kids and they love music, this would be audiobook to listen to with them.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.360

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.420
After "Are we there yet?", maybe the most common thing  a kid says on  road trip is: I'm hungry.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.440
I'm hungry. I've got to eat lunch in here?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.560
No, we'll probably eat lunch somewhere outside of the car.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.560
 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.340
Mom, where are we going to eat? Because I'm really hungry.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.440
You're very hungry? Well, we're probably not going to eat for about an hour, and it will be a quick,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.120
quick bite so we can get back on the road.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.220
Quick bite.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.160
Have you ever heard the word 'bite' to mean meal or snack?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.840
A bite is singular, it's a noun.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.080
Mmm, this is so good.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.760
Do you want a bite?

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:16.400
It's also sometimes a verb, I have to tell my one-year-old: Don't bite me. But we also use it to mean food in general.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.240
I said: It will be a quick bite so we can get back on the road. a quick bite.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.500
A meal that you hope doesn't take long. I'm going to grab a quick bite and then stop by.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.800
You might also hear it in the phrase: A bite to eat. Hmmm it's almost lunch time.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.640
Do you want to get a bite to eat? I don't mean one bite of food, of course. I mean a meal.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.300
David, do you remember when we were in Italy?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.880
And you couldn't figure out the gas pump?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.280
What was the deal with that?

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.540
It's just different from what we're used to in the-- finally, some other guy pulled up to fill up the--

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.920
Yeah, yeah. Pity on me. But I don't remember what was so different.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.400
I don't either, but we should, we should take the camera out when we will up and explain how it works.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.340
Because that's intimidating I feel like, when you're in another country, you're not

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.720
&gt;&gt; totally sure how something like that works.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.540
Ok, so a quick rundown about getting gas in the US.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.780
Rundown, one word, this is a noun.  It means an analysis, a summary.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.560
As two words, it’s a phrasal verb with various meanings.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.420
But I said, let's do a quick rundown about getting gas in the US. Let's do a quick summary.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:35.720
There are 2 kinds: self and full. Self means you pump your own gas.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.940
And full means someone else pumps your gas for you and you don't have to get out of your car.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.480
It's short for full service.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.020
And the gas pumps will be marked 'self' or 'full'.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:52.680
Now, almost everywhere in the US is self serve. Except for New Jersey where it's all full

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.680
and also some spots in Oregon and a few towns elsewhere.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.660
If you're at a self-serve spot, and you use a credit or debit card,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.380
you just insert it, you'll usually have to enter your zipcode, select the grade,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.980
that is the quality or purity of the gas you're using, and sometimes you have to flip up part of the pump.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.980
If you're paying cash, you usually have to do that before you start pumping.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.920
So you'll find the cashier inside, tell them how much you want and what is your pump number.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.480
You can say something like "Twenty dollars on four."

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.200
Now, when you’re on a long road trip, there’s a chance you’re going to have to stop for food.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.000
We found a service plaza, that’s something that caters only to people coming on and off the highway,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.720
and the idea is that it’s faster than getting off at an exit and driving to a restaurant.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.140
But it’s pretty easy to get pretty terrible food there.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.400
Are your beans and rice good?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.000
How's your burrito?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.400
Honestly, the first bite was really bland.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.480
Oh no. Okay.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.300
Bland.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.420
That is, tasteless, not flavorful, not very good.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.260
You can also use this to describe a person. He’s got a bland personality.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
That means he’s not very interesting, pretty boring.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.660
Luckily, I made Sawyer some really tasty corn puree so he was happy.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.600
Now, if we’re not eating food, often, we’re 
talking about food.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.620
We tried to go to Loco Pez last night and it was so on fire.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.020
It was like it-- I don't know.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.180
But it was something.'

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.380
They were slammed.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.660
 

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:34.540
So we had to bail and we went to Cedar Point which was totally empty.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.840
 

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.640
Did you enjoy it?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.660
It was okay.  I didn't think it would-- we were not blown away, were we, babe?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.700
What's that?

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.640
&gt;&gt; We weren't blown away, were we? I wasn't.
&gt;&gt;No.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.740
Loco Pez, that’s a local restaurant in Philadelphia, Mexican inspired food,

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.360
Spanish inspired name with the old American twist and pronunciation.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.720
Did you hear some of the words we used to describe this restaurant?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.020
And it was so on fire.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:09.660
On fire.  No, the restaurant was not burning down, it was very busy, very popular.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.440
We can use this term to mean really good.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:18.180
Maybe you’re at a family wedding and your uncle is dancing all night, he’s got great moves, you could say,

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.700
he’s on fire.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:25.380
You could say this in sports too, basketball, someone just keeps making shot after shot, you could say,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.380
she’s on fire!

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.760
We tried to go to Loco Pez last night and it was so on fire.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.820
It was like it-- I don't know. But it was something.'

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.440
They were slammed.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.700
David said, they were slammed.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.780
So that means really busy.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:49.120
Actually, you may have already learned that in the video I did earlier this month on ways to say you’re busy.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.940
That was one of the terms we learned! Slammed.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.480
So we had to bail.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.200
I said we had to bail.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.780
That means we had to give up, we had to do something different than what was planned.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.400
We were going to eat there, but it was so busy, we had to bail and go somewhere else.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.560
And we went to Cedar Point which was totally empty.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.620
 

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.700
Did you enjoy it?

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.480
It was okay.  I didn't think it would-- we were not blown away, were we, babe?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.580
What's that?

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.700
&gt;&gt; We weren't blown away, were we? I wasn't.
&gt;&gt; No.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.820
And the place we went, we were not blown away.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.500
Blown away is a good thing.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.640
You get blown away by something that exceeds expectation.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.660
 

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:41.040
Just dropped off our friend, going to head home, the final 3 minutes of the drive. It went well.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:48.780
Everyone's in one piece. No blown out tires. One tipped camera, however.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.880
 

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.100
&gt;&gt; Was that..what's her name?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.500
What is her name?

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.660
 

00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:01.520
If you can’t think of someone’s name, you can call her what’s-her-name, notice I'm dropping the H in there.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:09.720
What's her-- what's her name? Or what's his name? Again, dropping the H, what's his-- what's his name?

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.160
What's her name? What's his name?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.580
&gt;&gt; Was that..what's her name?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.820
What is her name?

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.060
 

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:27.620
We made it! Good roadtrip, everybody? Yay! That's it and thanks so much for using Rachel's English!

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.760
That's not even my ending anymore, I don't know why I did that.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.560
 

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.660
I was being crazy.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.520
Next week’s video was also shot on this road trip, and it’s driving vocabulary.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.520
It covers terms like blind spot, shoulder, tailgate, and back seat driver.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.440
Be sure to join mere here next Tuesday to see it.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.440
Now, I promised you the video where I ran out of gas on a road trip, and that’s a fun one, do check it out.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.560
If you’ve already seen it, please watch another Rachel’s English video from the suggested videos.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.020
I love teaching you English, thank you for joining me here.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.800
Now I will say it: That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.
