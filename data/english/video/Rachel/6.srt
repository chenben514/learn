00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Today we’ll study some travel vocabulary phrases together as you come with me for a weekend

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.580
at the Standard hotel in New York City.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.120
You’ll learn phrases and vocabulary that you might use at a hotel, like ‘amenities’ or ‘incidentals’.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.120
We’ll order room service together and 
enjoy some amazing views.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.020
 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.020
First, let's check in.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.580
Hi! Um, I booked online.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.200
Rachel Smith.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.280
And then about an hour after I booked, I 
booked an upgrade.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.600
I’m using the verb here to ‘book’.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.720
I’m sure you’re very familiar with the noun 
version of this word, book,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.980
but it’s also a verb which means to reserve something.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.880
I booked a hotel room, you could also 
book a table at a restaurant.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.020
This means you’ve made a reservation.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.020
You could book a venue for your wedding, or a concert venue could book an act or band.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.000
The bar around the corner booked my 
friend’s band for Friday.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.940
Here, OO makes the UH as in PUSH vowel.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.800
Book.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.960
Uh. Book.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.700
So both the noun ‘book’ and the verb 
‘book’ are pronounced exactly the same.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.360
Hi! Um, I booked online.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.020
Rachel Smith.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.140
And then about an hour after I booked, I 
booked an upgrade.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.400
I used the term ‘upgrade’.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.560
This means to improve on something.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.200
To get a higher quality.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.800
For example, if you’ve had your cell phone for a while, and it’s a bit slow, you might want to get an upgrade.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000
Here, I'm using it as a noun.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.540
On a flight, you might be upgraded from 
an economy to a first class seat.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.640
Here, I'm using it as a verb.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.820
Upgrade.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.840
In this case, I booked a hotel room, and then the system asked me if I wanted to upgrade.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.460
The offer seemed like a good deal to me, 
so I did upgrade.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.940
A paid a bit more money for a bigger, better room.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.940
And then about an hour after I booked, I 
booked an upgrade.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.880
Because it sounded very enticing, what 
was being offered.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.680
Do you see how pregnant I am here?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.580
I’m 8 months pregnant, and this was the last weekend that my doctor said I could travel away from home.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.000
So we took Stoney to my in-laws, that is, David’s parents, and took this short trip.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.300
In the US, you might hear people call this a babymoon.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.200
That is, a relaxing trip you take before 
before it’s harder to travel because you have a baby.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.420
This is related to the term ‘honeymoon’,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.340
which is a trip you take alone with your 
partner right after you get married.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.280
You booked for a water-view, de luxe king, correct?
Yes. South-facing.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.020
Here, we’re using some terms that you 
might use when describing a room.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.020
We booked a king, which means it has a 
king-sized bed in it.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.920
King and California King are the two largest-sized beds.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.060
She used the term water-view.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.160
This simply means what you can see from your room.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.520
You might have city-view, park-view, water-view, ocean-view, garden-view, street-view.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.760
This hotel is close to the Hudson River.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.280
I used the term ‘south-facing’.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.420
This means when you’re in your room looking out the window, which direction are you looking?

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.660
I knew I wanted to be south-facing because just north of the hotel are some taller buildings.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.300
I didn’t want to look directly at another building, so I upgraded to a south-facing room.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.240
You might also see a room described as a corner room,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.460
which of course means you’re on the 
corner of the building,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.420
and you might get views in two different directions.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.320
- You booked for a water-view, de luxe king, correct?
- Yes. South-facing.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.320
If I could just see a form of ID and a credit card for the reservation.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.080
Sure.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.400
When checking into a hotel, there’s a good chance that they’ll ask for a form of ID, like she did.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.560
That would be something official with your picture and name on it, like a driver’s license or passport.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.900
ID is short for ‘identification.’

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.260
They’ll also usually want a credit card from you

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.380
so they can make charges to the room if 
you damage or take anything.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.360
If I could just see a form of ID and a credit card for the reservation.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.860
Sure.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.380
So I see that initially, you kind of deposit down for the room so we would just need the card for incidentals.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.840
Okay, no problem.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.280
Incidentals.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.020
This is the word they use for anything in 
addition to the cost of the room.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.180
For example, if you eat or drink from the 
mini-bar in your room,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.000
they will keep track of that and charge it 
to your card after you leave.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.320
- so we would just need the card for incidentals.
- Okay, no problem.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.780
- And it doesn't...it's not ready yet by chance, is it?
- It is!

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.900
Oh, perfect!

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.200
She asks, “have you stayed here before?”

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.600
Oh, no. I've not. It's been on my bucket list.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.760
Bucket list.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.500
Have you heard this term before?

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.460
It means something you want to do within your lifetime.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.440
For example, visiting Paris is on my bucket list.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.440
Oh, no. I've not. It's been on my bucket 
list. So I'm glad that it's happening.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.540
Yes.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.780
This initial here, here, and a signature there.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.580
And if you can just add this gentleman's 
name right there.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.380
Sure.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.340
There might be something you have to initial or sign when checking into a hotel.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.020
Initial, of course, means you just put RS instead of your whole signature, Rachel Smith.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.120
This initial here, here, and a signature there. And if you can just add this gentleman's name right there.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.980
Sure.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.940
We finish checking in and head up to our room.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.540
Room number 814, we have a card as a key.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.720
Very dark elevator.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.600
So this is why I don't want to be north-facing. It's because then you're just looking at a building.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.920
North-facing, south-facing.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.400
It can be very handy to know the details of the room you want when booking a hotel.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.840
Let’s go find the room.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.020
There's the river.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:06:00.040
And there's the city.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.940
And there's The High Line.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.680
How cool is that?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.400
The Highline is a park in NYC that was 
built on top of an abandoned raised train line.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.980
I’ll also talk about The Whitney, which is an art museum.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.080
That's The Whitney, right there.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.340
Have you ever been to The Whitney, David? The new one?

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.480
Yeah.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.180
And that's the little rooftop spot there.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.460
Maybe we'll...maybe we should go. They have um,

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.300
pay-as-you-wish entrance on Friday evenings.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.060
Alright, well, let's settle in.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.760
“Settle in” is a phrase that means to unpack, to get comfortable, to arrange your things in a new place.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.360
After a big move, it can take some time to settle in.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.880
Whenever we stay somewhere, even if it’s just for a night or two,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.820
I like to spend some time settling in when we first arrive to make the stay more comfortable.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.720
Alright, well, let's settle in.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.920
That night, our friend Renee dropped by 
and we ordered room service.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.480
Generally you can reach the front desk by pressing 0.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.440
The front desk is there in the lobby, where 
we checked in.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.400
You call them with all your needs and questions.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.240
Room service is for the restaurant in the hotel that can make and bring food to your room.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.800
 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.280
Hi! Is this where I call to place a room service order?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.220
 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.860
Thank you.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.940
It was the front desk, not room service.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.440
Thank you for calling room service.
How can I help you?

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.320
Hi! I'm in room 814.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.900
And I'd like to order two orders of fries 
and does that come with ketchup?

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.860
- Yeah! 
- Okay.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.220
And also, two orders of a good pickle.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.620
Okay.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.220
Do you want anything to drink with that?

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.680
Um, anyone thirsty?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.500
No. I think we're good.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:59.180
If you ask someone if they want something, or offer them something, and they say “I’m good” or “we’re good”,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.440
that’s like saying “no thank you.”  
That person does not want it.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.240
Anyone thirsty?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.740
No. I think we're good.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.060
They told me it would be a 30-minute wait.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.240
Okay, I am 8 months pregnant, if that 
helps boost me forward.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.900
Okay, not a problem.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.340
Okay, I'm just kidding. Thank you!

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.840
Bye!

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.680
I mean I'm not kidding.
I am 8 months pregnant, if that makes a difference.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.860
Luckily, the food came quickly.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.480
- Wow. That's a lot of fries.
- That is a lot of fries.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.740
Ooh. I didn't expect them to be so little.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.120
I think we could've gotten by with one order.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.840
Nope.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.560
No?

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.080
No. I'm so glad we have two.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.420
Mini mayonaise.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.380
All the best to go with the mini ketchup.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.720
Mini ketchup.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.780
And then 2 good pickles.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.360
Okay, what did you think of yours?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.880
I give it an 8 out of 10.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.720
- I think I'm going to give it a 6 or 7 out of 10.
- Oh, so low.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.140
Do you do this too?

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.760
We rated how much we liked the pickle on 
a scale of 1-10.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.260
1 is always the lowest, and 10 the highest, 
the very best of the best.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.200
So I didn’t love the pickle.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.800
Still, there’s something very luxurious about eating French fries in your hotel room at 10:30 at night.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.060
Many hotels have an ice machine.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.660
This one was labeled an ice dispenser.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.940
So almost every hotel room in America has an ice bucket that you can take to the machine to fill up.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.060
This one also had tongs to serve ice into glasses.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.120
David and I had such a relaxing stay here 
enjoying slow days.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.160
Before we leave,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.860
let’s go over a few more words and phrases that might be useful to you as you travel, as you stay in hotels.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.240
First, when you check into a hotel, you will find the front desk in the lobby,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.520
and you can probably find a luggage cart there to help you get all your luggage to your room.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.520
The opposite of checking in is checking out.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.540
Check out, of course, is when you leave 
the hotel room and you give back your key.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.980
Two phrasal verbs for your travel 
vocabulary:  check in, check out.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.320
Here, I called the front desk to ask what 
time check out was.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.460
I also had to report an issue about the room.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.540
 

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.780
Hi Freddie! I am wondering what time 
check out is tomorrow morning?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.860
It is 12 pm.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.040
Okay, perfect.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:27.300
Uh, my other question is I'm in room 814 and the drain to the bathtub doesn't seem to close all the way.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.740
 

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.040
That's great! We're actually going to head out in a minute. Is it okay if we're not here?

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040
 

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.960
Okay, thank you so much.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.980
I used the phrasal verb ‘head out’.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.360
This means to leave.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.780
We were just getting ready to leave our room for a walk.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.900
Head out.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.260
That's great! We're actually going to head out in a minute. Is it okay if we're not here?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.140
 

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.040
Okay, thank you so much.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.740
We don't even need to try to get a late check out 'cause check out's noon. It's perfect.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.240
This particular hotel  does have a mini bar.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:05.180
So that is place where they're going to 
have some food and snacks for you.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.520
They have some glasses for us, nice.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.300
And there's also a refrigerator.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.840
Mini-bar usually refers to refrigerator.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.140
refrigerator.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:21.260
And this one is fully stocked so that means it came with all sorts of goodies ready for us.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.640
Now, usually, if you eat or drink what 
comes here in hotel, it's quite expensive.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.940
Much more expensive that just running 
out and buying it yourself.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:39.800
Another neat thing that this particular 
hotel room has is a shower bathroom.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.720
So it's this whole room, floor, ceiling, it doesn't matter if they get the whole thing wet,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:53.040
a big bath tub, and then there are some slats that look out into the room so you can still see the view

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.940
as you take your shower.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.360
This hotel room also has a safe.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:08.260
Many, many hotel rooms do so you can put passports or money, valuables, whatever, in this safe when you leave.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:14.280
One thing that people are often interested in when choosing a hotel is the list of amenities.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:20.700
Amenities would be things like a gym or a 
pool or room service.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.920
Other things that you get in addition to your room or special things that you might get in your room.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.000
Many hotels come with a little card like this.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.180
This one says 'Privacy Please'

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.980
and you hang this on your door knob to let them know: I don't want anyone to come in and work on my room.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:45.780
Or on the other side: I do want someone to come in, change out my towels for clean towels, maybe vacuum.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:51.820
So this card says "Privacy Please" but you might also see "Do Not Disturb".

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.520
Thank you guys for traveling with me to 
New York city this weekend.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.880
I also have a video that I made on travel phrases that you may use when checking in at an airport.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.520
Be sure to check that out.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.340
Are there other travel vocabularies or 
phrases videos that you'd like to see?

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.600
Please let me know in the comments below.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.920
Big thanks to David and Renee for being 
in this video with me.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.840
That's it guys and thanks so much for using 
Rachel's English.
