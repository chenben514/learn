00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.766
In this American English Pronunciation video,
we’re going to go over a few idioms relating to golf.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:08.586
Check out this swing.

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:24.159
So the word ‘par’ and some idioms around ‘par’
are used for things not relating to golf.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.342
‘Par,’ let’s practice that together,
like ‘car’ and ‘star’, it’s a little tricky.

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:37.433
You have to let your jaw drop with your
tongue forward for ‘a.’ ‘Par,’ -a-.

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:45.179
Then the tongue will lift back and up for the ‘r’ sound.
‘Par.’ The tip shouldn’t be touching anything.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:54.961
Try it slowly, ‘Par,’ ‘par,’ ‘par.’
Keep listening to the word ‘par’ in this conversation.

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:58.700
But I think ‘par’ comes from golf.
This is my Dad, everybody.

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.628
&gt;&gt;Hello!
&gt;&gt; He just went golfing today.

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.642
&gt;&gt; Dad what does ‘par’ mean in golf?

00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:11.518
&gt;&gt; ‘Par’ is the score for any given hole
or for the whole 18 holes of a round,

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:17.446
that would be an expectation for a very good golfer.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So can you give an example?

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:23.460
&gt;&gt; Well, holes are either…a fairly short hole is a ‘par’ 3

00:01:23.468 --> 00:01:28.625
so a very good golfer should be able
to make it in the cup within 3 shots.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:40.100
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, let’s talk about what ‘par’ means 
in these idioms. We have the idioms ‘subpar’ or ‘below par.’

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:50.195
&gt;&gt; ‘Below Par’ in golf would be very good because,
say, a round of 18 holes where ‘par’ might be 72,

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:52.910
a very good golfer might do a 70.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:56.061
&gt;&gt; Or ev--, 68, or even a 65.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:56.062 --> 00:02:00.017
&gt;&gt; So ‘below par’ is great in golf.
&gt;&gt; Because of course,

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:05.507
the point is to do it in the fewest strokes possible.
&gt;&gt; That’s right.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:10.688
&gt;&gt; But ‘below par’ or ‘subpar’ in…as an idiom…

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.572
&gt;&gt; Is usually a negative thing.
&gt;&gt; Right. Opposite meaning.

00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:19.698
&gt;&gt; So, if you feel sort of sick you’re feeling 
a little ‘below par’ today… &gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.080
&gt;&gt; You don’t feel real well.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:29.385
‘Below par’ or ‘subpar’:
great in golf because you want the lowest score possible.

00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:38.086
But as an idiom, ‘below par’ or ‘subpar’
is a bad thing, not meeting expectation.

00:02:38.087 --> 00:02:44.936
A note on the pronunciation of ‘subpar.’
You don’t need to release the ‘B’ then make a ‘P’.

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:53.858
That will make it choppy, ‘subpar,’ ‘subpar.’
Hold your lips in place and voice the vocal cords.

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:02.356
Sub-, -b-, -b-, -b-, -par. Then go right into the ‘P’ sound.
Don’t release the ‘B.’ ‘Subpar.’

00:03:02.357 --> 00:03:08.605
Last night I was eating a cookie that wasn’t very good,
happened to have the video camera running,

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:12.107
and I used the idiom, let’s check it out.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:20.713
&gt;&gt; These cookies aren’t very good, not up to par, subpar.
I’m not going to eat the rest.

00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:27.743
So another idiom would be ‘on par,’ right?
Which basically just means meeting expectations.

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:32.038
&gt;&gt; Yeah, ‘par for the course’ means,
it’s just sort of a normal thing,

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.833
it wasn’t particularly great,
it wasn’t particularly bad.

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:38.065
&gt;&gt; Right.  &gt;&gt; But it’s, it’s the normal.
&gt;&gt; Expectation.

00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:42.501
On ‘par’: meeting expectations or equal to something.

00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:48.287
An example,
let’s say Renee was a great employee who had to leave.

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:55.408
Your friend asks, how is the new employee?
And you say, she’s great, on par with Renee.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:04.428
‘Par for the course.’ Note the stress pattern here.
‘Par’ and ‘course’ are stressed. ‘Par for the course.’

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:16.678
‘For’ and ‘the’ are unstressed. For the, for the, for the.
‘Par for the course.’ ‘Par for the course.’ Listen again,

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:24.019
&gt;&gt; Par for the course [4x]

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.022
But how would you use it. So, when you think
of saying something as ‘par for the course,’

00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:37.436
and… I think it sometimes has a negative meaning
like, this is what was expected and it’s not great.

00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:42.757
Like for example,
we’re on vacation, it’s been raining every day,

00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:48.993
and you say Rachel what’s the weather forecast for today?
And I say ‘par for the course,’ rain again.

00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:51.727
&gt;&gt; I disagree with that.
&gt;&gt; That’s okay.

00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:55.933
Granted, you’re not the pronunciation expert that I am but…
&gt;&gt; This is true.

00:04:55.934 --> 00:04:58.398
&gt;&gt; You have been speaking English longer than I have.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.682
&gt;&gt; This is true also. 
&gt;&gt; So what do you think about it?

00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:07.719
&gt;&gt; I think it just means, it’s the normal, its average.
So ‘par for the course,’

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.900
if you’re having great weather 5 days in
a row and the 6th day is great weather,

00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:16.872
you say, well ‘par for the course’ for this week.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:16.873 --> 00:05:21.380
&gt;&gt; It’s been great every day. 
&gt;&gt; Okay, I, I agree that you can say it like that.

00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:29.413
But I think most of the time it’s used to reinforce a
negative expectation. But we can agree to disagree.

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:33.905
&gt;&gt; Well, that’s ‘par for the course’ for you.
You would disagree with what I have to say.

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:39.813
&gt;&gt; That’s true, great use of the idiom. 
&gt;&gt; And that is a negative, it really is.

00:05:39.814 --> 00:05:49.889
A couple other idioms, ‘above par’: that means above average
or expectation. Sara’s work is ‘above par’ she’s fantastic.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:57.592
‘Up to par,’ as good as expected or average.
Examples: I’m not feeling ‘up to par’ today.

00:05:57.593 --> 00:06:01.137
Or Sally’s work is good, ‘up to par’.

00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:03.438
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Dad, for joining me on this video.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.399
Guys if you liked my Dad, like the video, 
and share with everyone you know.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.524
That’s it and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.

00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:22.650
Check out this swing. Was it a good swing? Okay.
