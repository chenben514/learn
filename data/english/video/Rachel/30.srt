00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; Here with my friend Tom, my favorite Rachel’s
English teacher, besides myself.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.919
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; We’re going to have a little conversation

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.919
and then turn it into a Ben Franklin exercise.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.330
&gt;&gt; Are you stressed about anything, Rach?
Can I call you Rach?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.240
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach.
&gt;&gt; Um, sort, of, but in a very good way. You

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.270
know I’m leaving for Europe.
&gt;&gt; Yes, that’s right. How long are you going

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.870
to be gone for?
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.730
&gt;&gt; That’s a good long time.
&gt;&gt; It’s a good long time. I’m leaving

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.730
in 10 days. So it feels like there’s a lot
to be done.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.270
&gt;&gt; Are you stressed about anything, Rach?
[2x]

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.270
Are you stressed about anything, Rach? Every
word there was quite fast except for the word

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.270
‘you’. It’s a little uncommon to stress
a function word like this. Normally, I think

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.500
I would stress the word ‘stressed’. Are
you stressed about anything, Rach? But the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.970
reason why Tom stressed the word ‘you’
is because I had just asked him if he was

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.780
stressed about anything. So now, he was turning
the question to me, and he stressed ‘you’.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.330
Are you stressed about anything, Rach?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.780
&gt;&gt; Are you stressed about anything, Rach?
[2x]

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.950
A couple other things I notice about this
sentence, Tom turns the T into a D, making

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.000
it a flap. About anything, about anything.
He’s doing this because it’s a T coming

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.950
between two vowel sounds. Even though it’s
two separate words, the T still comes between

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.170
two vowel sounds, which means it’s a great
opportunity to link the two words together

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.270
with a Flap T (which sounds like the American
D).

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.460
About anything [3x]. Are you stressed about
anything, Rach?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.770
&gt;&gt; Are you stressed about anything, Rach?
[2x]

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.380
Did you notice how the intonation went up
at the end? About anything Rach? Rach? Rach?

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.120
That’s because this is a yes/no question.
And yes/no questions go up in pitch at the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.150
end.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.809
&gt;&gt; Are you stressed about anything, Rach?
Can I call you Rach?

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.379
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.279
&gt;&gt; Can I call you Rach?
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:25.459
These next two sentences are great examples
of reducing the word ‘can’.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.819
&gt;&gt; Can I call you Rach?
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.669
The word ‘can’ is so fast there, as if
it has no vowels at all. Just the K sound

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:41.450
and the N sound. Kn, kn, kn. Can I call you
Rach? You can call me Rach.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.450
&gt;&gt; Can I call you Rach?
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach. [2x]

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.329
Notice how everything flows together. We don’t
feel like we have five separate words in this

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.349
sentence. Can I call you Rach? Can I call
you Rach? It’s just like one long word.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.590
We do that by linking words together. When
a word begins with a vowel, and the word before

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.809
ends in a consonant, this is an easy time
to link. Just like up here, when we used a

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:17.599
Flap T to link. Can I. [3x] Linking an ending
consonant to a beginning vowel helps smooth

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:24.299
out the line. Can I. Can I call you Rach?
You can call me Rach. Again, the word ‘can’

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.679
is almost lost here. Kn, kn. You can call
me Rach.

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:33.049
&gt;&gt; Can I call you Rach?
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach. [2x]

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.790
We reduce the word ‘can’ like this when
it’s not the only verb in the sentence.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.089
In these two sentences, the main verb is ‘call’.
That means the word ‘can’ is a helping

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:50.639
verb. That’s a function word, it’s not
as important as the main verb ‘call’.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.760
The word ‘can’ is usually a helping verb.
When you pronounce it reduced, kn, kn, it

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.780
will help you sound more American. Can I call
you Rach? You can call me Rach. Kn, kn.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.939
&gt;&gt; Can I call you Rach?
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.109
&gt;&gt; Um, sort of, but in a very good way.

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.950
Did you notice? Another Flap T here, linking
the word ‘sort’ and ‘of’. Sort of,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.850
sort of, sort of. So it sounded like an American
D. I just said that when the T comes between

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:31.120
two vowel sounds, it turns into a Flap T and
can link words. But R is not a vowel sound.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.510
The rule is, if the T comes between two vowels,
or after an R, before a vowel, that it becomes

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:45.350
a Flap T. Sort of. [3x] If we think of this
as one word, stress is on the first syllable.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:54.270
Sor-duv. And the second syllable is very fast.
It has the schwa, not a full vowel. Sort of. [2x]

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.720
&gt;&gt; Um, sort of, but in a very good way.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.560
Let’s go back for a second. I left something
important out. The word ‘um’. This is

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.660
the word we use when we’re thinking. Um
or uh. These thinking sounds use the UH as

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.550
in BUTTER vowel. Uh, uh. I call this the core
sound of American English. Everything in the

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:28.710
mouth, face, neck, throat is extremely relaxed.
Uh, um. That allows the placement to be lower

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.990
in the body, less in the face. Very American.
Um, uh.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:43.150
&gt;&gt; Um, sort of, but in a very good way. [2x]

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.980
The first syllable of the word ‘very’,
ver-, and the word ‘way’, but in a very

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.480
good way, are the most stressed. Do you hear
how fast this string of function words is?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:04.240
But in a. [4x] But in a very good way. They
all link together. Again, we have ending consonant

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.420
linking into a beginning vowel, ending consonant
linking into a beginning vowel. Both of these

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:17.340
links help to make it sound like one word,
very smooth. But in a, but in a. Again, this

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.320
T is turning into a Flap T, or, a D sound.
But in a, but in a. But in a very good way.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.980
&gt;&gt; Um, sort of, but in a very good way. You
know I’m leaving for Europe.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.890
You know I’m leaving for Europe. What do
you hear as the most stressed syllables in

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:45.280
this sentence? I hear ‘know’, ‘leav-‘,
‘Eur-‘. You know I’m leaving for Europe.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.620
&gt;&gt; You know I’m leaving for Europe. [2x]

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:55.000
These are all the most important parts of
the sentence, the content words. Content words

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.680
are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
Here we have verb, verb, and proper noun.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.130
You know I’m leaving for Europe. Notice
that in a content word, for example, leaving,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.360
that only the stressed syllable is stressed.
Even though this is an important word, and

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.030
it’s a stressed word in the sentence, the
unstressed syllable, the –ing ending, is

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:30.280
not stressed. So, unstressed syllables, even
in stressed words, are still unstressed syllables.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.000
&gt;&gt; You know I’m leaving for Europe. [2x]

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.320
Notice I use the contraction I’m. Some of
my students don’t like to use contractions

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.169
because they don’t think they’re clear
enough. They will say ‘I am’. You know

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:50.780
I’m leaving for Europe. But using a contraction,
like I’m, is just like up here, where we

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:57.010
took these three words and linked them together
and made them very fast. But in a. So, contractions

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:03.199
are words we reduce and link together in writing
and in speech. I’m, I’m.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:07.330
&gt;&gt; You know I’m leaving for Europe. [2x]

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.210
Reducing and contracting words will help you sound
very American. There’s actually one more

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:18.530
example of a reduction in this sentence. It’s
the word ‘for’. For Europe. For Europe.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:26.700
I reduced that vowel to the schwa. And the
schwa-R together make one sound, rr. Rr, rr,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:34.659
fr, fr. For Europe, for Europe. And again,
here we have an ending consonant linking into

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:43.180
a beginning vowel. For Europe. [3x] So those
two words glide together very easily. For

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.739
Europe, for Europe.

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:50.709
&gt;&gt; You know I’m leaving for Europe.
&gt;&gt; Yes, that’s right. How long are you going

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:51.240
to be gone for?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.889
This was all very fast. Yes, that’s right.
How long are you going to be gone for? Wow.

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:03.809
Tom didn’t even really finish the word ‘right’.
Yes that’s right how long? He certainly

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:08.249
didn’t pronounce a full T. He moved on to
the next sentence before he even finished

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:09.089
that word.

00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:11.279
&gt;&gt; Yes, that’s right. How long are you going
to be gone for?

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:18.499
So there was no real break here between sentences.
You probably noticed he took ‘going to’

00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:25.709
and turned it into ‘gonna’. How long are
you gonna? You gonna? [3x] How long are you

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:26.510
gonna be gone for?

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.930
&gt;&gt; Yes, that’s right. How long are you going
to be gone for? [2x]

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.889
Did you notice Tom did not reduce the word
‘for’ to the schwa. Well, I just said

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:39.899
that that’s something that we want to do
with this word in order to make it sound more

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:45.360
American. But, I do need to add: we don’t
reduce words like ‘for’ when they’re

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.559
at the end of a sentence.

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:48.829
&gt;&gt; Yes, that’s right. How long are you going
to be gone for?

00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:53.759
There, they need to be fully pronounced. Even
though it was still very fast, it wasn’t

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:59.390
a stressed word, it did have the full vowel.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.620
&gt;&gt; Yes, that’s right. How long are you going
to be gone for?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.169
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:10.529
I’m going to be gone for five weeks. [2x]
Again, I used ‘I’m’ instead of ‘I

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:15.019
am’. That helped me make it fast and less
important, compared to the more important

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:16.199
words in the sentence.

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:20.309
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
[2x]

00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:25.369
You also may have noticed, I also took ‘going
to’ and pronounced it ‘gonna’.

00:10:25.369 --> 00:10:27.649
I’m gonna [3x].

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:31.740
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
[2x]

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.350
How do you hear this word ‘for’? Listen
again.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.239
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
[2x]

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:44.410
You’re right, it’s reduced. For, for,
for, for five, for five. For five weeks.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.600
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
[2x]

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:58.269
So, the most important words there, the loudest,
the clearest, are ‘gone’, ‘five’,

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:03.389
and ‘weeks’. Those are the words that
carry the actual meaning of the sentence.

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:10.430
So, we don’t reduce these more important
words. But if we say all the other words fast,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:16.290
reduce them, then it makes these more important
words stand out the most. I’m going to be

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.879
gone for five weeks.

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:21.029
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
&gt;&gt; That’s a good long time.

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:27.059
That’s a good long time. Tom didn’t really
pronounce the TH here. He reduced the word

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:34.189
‘that’s’ to just the schwa-TS sound.
Utsa, utsa, utsa good long time. [2x]

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:40.790
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
&gt;&gt; That’s a good long time. [2x]

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:46.100
We reduce that’s, it’s, what’s, at the
beginning of a sentence like this a lot. And

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.619
look, we have an ending consonant beginning
vowel to link. That’s a, [3x]

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:56.989
that’s a good long time. He stressed 
the last three words.

00:11:56.989 --> 00:12:03.209
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
&gt;&gt; That’s a good long time. [2x]

00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:15.209
We have adjective, adjective, noun. 

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:20.220
The three content words are stressed, 
longer, clearer.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.299
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.
&gt;&gt; That’s a good long time.

00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:26.399
&gt;&gt; It’s a good long time. I’m leaving
in ten days.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:32.169
I reduced the word ‘it’s’ by dropping
the vowel. Tsa, tsa, it’s a good long time.

00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.910
&gt;&gt; It’s a good long time. I’m leaving
in ten days.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:42.509
It’s a good long time. Linking the TS cluster
into the schwa. Tsa, tsa, it’s a good long

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:48.769
time. It’s a good long time. Again, these
three words are stressed, good long time.

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:54.689
I stressed the word ‘good’ the most. It’s
a good long time. It’s a good long time.

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:59.679
Just like Tom did earlier, I didn’t really
leave a sentence break here, did I? I went

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.989
straight on to my next thought.

00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:05.240
&gt;&gt; It’s a good long time. I’m leaving
in ten days.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:13.819
Look. Another contraction. The most important
syllables in that sentence: leav-, ten, days.

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:24.670
I’m leaving in ten days. [4x] Again, they’re
the most important parts of the sentence for

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.939
content. The verb leaving, and the time amount,
ten days.

00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:33.119
&gt;&gt; I’m leaving in ten days, so it feels
like there’s a lot to be done.

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:38.069
I notice the word ‘it’ is not very clear.
So it feels. [2x]

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:42.739
&gt;&gt; I’m leaving in ten days, so it feels
like there’s a lot to be done.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:47.910
So it feels like. The word ‘it’ begins
with a vowel. Here, the word before ends with

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:55.779
a vowel. So we can link vowel to vowel. So
it. [3x] So it feels like. It’s a very smooth

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:03.689
transition. And it can feel like I go through
the glide consonant W. So it. [3x] That helps

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:06.089
me link them together. So it feels like.

00:14:06.089 --> 00:14:13.000
What’s happening with the T in ‘it’?
It’s a Stop T. So it, so it, so it feels.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.860
So it feels like. The T is not fully pronounced,
tt. So it, so it. But instead, I stop the

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:28.489
air. So it. In general, we pronounce T’s
this way when the next sound is a consonant.

00:14:28.489 --> 00:14:34.059
So it feels like there’s a lot to be done.
And the ending Z sound of ‘there’s’

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:40.699
links right into the schwa sound uh. There’s
a, there’s a, there’s a lot to be done.

00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:44.509
&gt;&gt; There’s a lot to be done. [2x]

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:51.249
How are these two words pronounced? Lot to,
lot to. This is clearly not an ‘oo’ vowel,

00:14:51.249 --> 00:14:59.800
it’s a schwa. Lot to. But what about the
T’s? Lot to. I’m making the first T a

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:08.499
Stop T. Lot. So I’m just stopping the air
for a second—lot to, lot to—before releasing

00:15:08.499 --> 00:15:12.019
to make the second T. There’s a lot to be
done.

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:15.809
&gt;&gt; There’s a lot to be done. [2x]

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:22.790
We use these three words together, a lot to,
quite a bit. Let’s do a quick comparison

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:29.230
to ‘a lot of’, which we also use together
frequently. Here we have an ending T consonant

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:35.970
and beginning vowel. The T comes between two
vowels, so it’s a Flap T or a D sound. A

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:43.980
lot of, a lot of. So the T in ‘lot’ is
pronounced one way in this phrase, a lot to,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.980
and a different way in this phrase, a lot
of. Let’s listen to the whole bit of conversation

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.509
one more time.

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:55.489
&gt;&gt; Are you stressed about anything, Rach?
Can I call you Rach?

00:15:54.489 --> 00:16:00.199
&gt;&gt; You can call me Rach.
&gt;&gt; Um, sort, of, but in a very good way. You

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:03.179
know I’m leaving for Europe.
&gt;&gt; Yes, that’s right. How long are you going

00:16:03.179 --> 00:16:04.809
to be gone for?
&gt;&gt; I’m going to be gone for five weeks.

00:16:04.809 --> 00:16:07.660
&gt;&gt; That’s a good long time.
&gt;&gt; It’s a good long time. I’m leaving

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.439
in 10 days. So it feels like there’s a lot
to be done.

00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:18.499
Even with just a little bit of speech, there’s
a lot to study. Thanks for studying with me.

00:16:18.499 --> 00:16:23.499
That’s it, and thanks so much for using
Rachel’s English.
