You guys love Ben Franklin videos.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.839
They're one of the best ways for you to improve listening comprehension and

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.540
learn tricks to sound more natural when speaking English, like using specific reductions.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.220
This January, you're getting five all new Ben Franklin videos

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.160
where we do a full analysis of real American English conversations.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.200
Today's topic: grocery shopping.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.460
Let's get started with this analysis.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.360
First, the whole conversation.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.380
I just got my first weird look.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.360
But you know what? At the end of the day,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.340
- it doesn't matter.
- I know.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.340
At the end of the day, it's the students who matter.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.260
That's right.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.400
- Ok green beans.
- Ooo.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.380
- Cranberries. Fresh.
- Oh yeah.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.600
Oh, and I was hoping that we wouldn't have to buy a huge bag.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180
How many do we need?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.700
Now, The analysis.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.740
I just got my first weird look.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.980
I just got my first weird look.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.085
The words that I hear being the most stressed there are just, weird, and look.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:08.280
They're a little bit longer: So I just got my first weird look.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.339
Let's talk about the pronunciations of T here. They're interesting.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.000
First, we have a stop T in 'got my'.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.240
This is how we usually pronounce an ending T when the next word begins with a consonant.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.600
Got my-- So it's not: gah my-- gah my-- with a continuous flow of sound

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.160
but it's: got my-- got-- an abrupt stop for the word, then the word 'my'.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.300
Got my- We stopped the air in our throat and that signifies the stop T.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.260
Got my--

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Got my-- Got my-- Got my--

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.080
The other two T's are also ending T's but
now they're part of a cluster, the ST cluster

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.020
and it's very common when a T is
between two other consonants, to drop that T.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.340
So if you look, when we link the
two words together, which we always do

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.960
with a thought group, the T's now come
between two consonants.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.080
So we will drop them. This is so common with ST ending clusters.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.900
When the next word begins the consonant, we drop it.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.180
So the word 'just' is a very common word and when it is followed by a consonant word, we drop that T sound.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.740
So instead of 'I just got' it becomes 'I just got'

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.480
Just got- The S sound right into the G.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.400
Does this sound familiar to you?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.100
Do you think you've heard Americans doing this?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.720
It's really common.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.820
Just got-

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.460
Just got- Just got- Just got my first weird look.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.540
And for 'first weird', we pronounce that: first weird- firsts weird-

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.660
Right from the S into the W

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.680
and this helps us link the two words more smoothly,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.120
and we always like a smooth  line in American English.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.380
First weird look. First weird look. First weird look.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.580
But you know what? At the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.660
She's speaking really quickly here:

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.320
But you know what? At the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.520
So even though she's speaking really quickly,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.880
some of the  syllables are a little bit longer and that's what helps make it clear to a  native listener.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.120
Let's just look at the first sentence: But you know what?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.340
'Know' and  'what' both a little bit longer, we have a stop T at the end of 'what'.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.880
But you know what?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.740
The intonation goes up at the end,
it's a yes/no question.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.040
But you know what? But you know what? But you know what?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.900
What about 'but' and 'you'?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.920
She pronounces that so quickly: but you- but you-

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.360
She actually drops the T which isn't that common in general

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.380
but  in this phrase, which is pretty common,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.820
But you know what? Or You know what?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.040
We say that quite a bit and in a phrase
that's more common,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.860
we tend to do even more reductions because of the familiarity.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.320
We know that it will still be understood.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.560
So it's very common to pronounce this phrase: But you know what?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.500
But you- But you- But you- But you-

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.580
These two words linked together, said very quickly, become just the B sound and the schwa,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.700
buh- buh- buh-

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.200
then the Y sound, and the schwa, a common reduction  of the word 'you'.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.280
But you- But you- But you- But you know what?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.520
But you know what? But you know what? But you know what? At the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.700
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.500
'End' a little bit longer.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.240
At the end--

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.920
At the end--

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.720
Of the day--

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.800
It doesn't ma--tter.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.740
So those syllables are a little bit longer

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.520
which provides a little contrast with her very fast speech, her very fast  unstressed words.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.120
And we do need this contrast of stressed and unstressed to  sound natural in American English.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.960
So let's look at the unstressed words 'at'  and 'the'.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.240
At the end of the day-

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.280
At the end of the day-

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.560
At the end of the day-

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.680
It's actually 'at the' and the vowel is so fast.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.380
This can either be the whole AH vowel or it can be the schwa:

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.240
but- but- but- or at- at- at- at-

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.340
At the end of the day--

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.420
At the end of the day---

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.420
At the end of the day--

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.820
It doesn't really matter. What matters is that it said incredibly quickly.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.140
We have a stop T so the word 'at' is cut off a little abrupt.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.420
You stop the air in your throat
and the E here is pronounced as the EE as in she vowel

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.820
because the next word begins with a vowel or diphthong sound.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.840
If the next word began with a consonant sound,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.660
then it would be: the- which is what
we get here.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.360
Here, it's pronounced as the schwa because the next sound is a consonant sound.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.960
So we have 'the end' and 'the day'.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.940
But of course it's not pronounced that clearly, is it?

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.240
Because this isn't an important word, so it's: at the-- at the-- at the-- at the--

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.420
at the end of the day-- at the end of the day-- at the end of the day--

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.300
'Of' and 'the' becomes: of the-- of the--

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.440
The whole word 'of' is reduced to just the schwa, which we link on to the word 'the'.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.060
of the-- of the--  of the--

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.640
end of the day--

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.560
end of the day--

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.840
at the end of the day--

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.160
end of the day-- the end of the day-- end of the day--

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.960
So making these less important words
really quickly helps provide the contrast we need.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.560
Practice that with me.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.100
at the- at the- at the-

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.000
of the- of the- of the-

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.380
at the end of the day-- at the end of the day--

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.400
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.300
The words 'it' and 'doesn't' also said pretty quickly.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.960
Another stop T here.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.940
It doesn't matter.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.840
It doesn't matter.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.140
It doesn't matter.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.420
It doesn't matter.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.000
It doesn't matter.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.220
It doesn't matter. Now I think I hear the T here being totally  dropped as well.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:06.780
This is pretty common. We either drop the T or we make it sort of a nasal stop sound to signify the NT:

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.360
doesn't-- nt-- nt-- nt-- nt--

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.860
But here, I think she's just making the N sound glide right into the M sound:

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.260
doesn't matter--

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.380
And because of that  smooth connection, there's no stop.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.140
It doesn't matter.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.520
It doesn't matter.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.600
The word 'it' very quick stop after 'it'

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.300
but these two words are still said pretty quickly: it doesn't-- It doesn't matter.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:40.240
And then the stressed syllable ah with the AH vowel in 'matter' and then we have a
flap T: matter.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.580
- It doesn't matter. 
- I know.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.760
- It doesn't matter. 
- I know.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.520
- It doesn't matter. 
- I know.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.860
I know.  I know.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.100
So I said  this at the same time she was saying doesn't matter.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.460
I know.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.480
It's a two-word  phrase and stress is on the word 'know'

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.400
but the pitch of the whole phrase is smooth. It's not: I know.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.240
But it's this smooth line connecting.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.840
I know.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.080
It's the smooth change in pitch. This rise and fall of intonation

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.720
that makes one of the characteristics of American English.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.320
Smooth transitions. We want the words to be linked.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.240
We want the change in intonation to be smooth so that nothing's choppy.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.220
I know.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.940
I know. I know. I know.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.380
At the end of the day--

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.900
At the end of the day--

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.140
Now here I definitely reduce the
vowel to the schwa: but at- Stop T.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.220
At the end of the day--

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.100
Again, the whole phrase is very smooth.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.240
At the end of the day-

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:52.060
with 'end' and 'day' being a little bit longer,
also having that peak in intonation.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:59.140
Again, the letter E here makes the EE as in she vowel because the next word begins with a vowel sound.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.620
And here it makes the schwa because the next word begins with a consonant.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.020
So we have: at the-- at the end--

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.400
and then I also drop the V sound and make just the schwa.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.000
of the--

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.420
of the-- of the-- of the--

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.800
These two words said very quickly: of the day--

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.680
At the end of the day--

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.780
At the end of the day-- At the end of the day--

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.160
At the end of the day, it's the students who matter.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.540
It's the students who matter.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:38.640
And here 'stu-' is the most stressed syllable of that phrase. Ma-- also a little stressed.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.100
Again, we have a flap T here: matter-

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.020
It's the students who matter.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.400
It's the- said quickly: it's the- it's the- it's the-

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.740
it's the stu-- it's the stu-- it's the stu--

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.780
Stu-- dents who-- dents who-- dents who--

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.940
Students-- Students-- Students--

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.260
Then these two syllables more quickly.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.580
Ma-- another little stretch.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.080
It's the students who matter. Aaahhhh--

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.600
Smooth change in intonation with peaks on the stressed syllables.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.060
It's the students who matter.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.380
It's the students who matter.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.820
It's the students who matter.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.860
That's right.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.060
That's right. That's right. That's right.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.500
The TH sound here not terribly clear.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.850
She's not bringing the tongue tip
through the teeth for it but she's

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.280
pressing the tongue tip on the backs of
the teeth where the top and bottom teeth meet.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.720
that's- that's- that's- that's- that's-
That's right.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.440
It allows us to make that sound a little bit more quickly: That's right.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.540
That's right. That's right. That's right.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.440
Now here, we have the TS cluster into the R.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.140
All of these sounds are  pronounced. we get ts-- and then er--

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.300
That's right. That's right.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.060
But this is a stop T where we cut off the air,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.220
the pitch doesn't fall down slowly.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.560
We have an abrupt stop. Right-- right-- That's right.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.020
Right-- right--   right--

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.320
Okay, green beans.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.860
Okay, green beans.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.720
'Green' most stressed word in that phrase and the pitch is all smooth.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.420
Okay, green beans.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:33.620
The pitch goes up, energy builds towards the stressed word, and then it falls away: beans-- afterwards.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.900
Green beans.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.200
Green beans.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.400
Green beans.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.640
While I say that, Laura says: Oooh. Oooh. Oooh.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.569
Just a little exclamation you make when you notice something

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:47.839
or something's important, you want to
call attention to it or if you get

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.480
excited about something. Oooh. Look at that.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.500
- Green beans. 
- Oooh.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.560
- Green beans. 
- Oooh.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.520
- Green beans. 
- Oooh.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.760
Cranberries.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.560
Cranberries.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.280
Cranberries. Cranberries.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.360
Stress is on the first syllable there. That's a three syllable word,

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:10.620
so the first syllable is 'cran' and the last two syllables are:  berries- berries- berries-

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.700
They're a little less clear, a little bit more mumbled,

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.080
that's how unstressed syllables sound.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.120
Cranberries.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.540
Cranberries.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.840
Cranberries.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.020
Cranberries.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:21.900
Fresh.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.080
Fresh.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.200
Fresh.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.720
What do you notice about the intonation of that word?

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.040
Fresh.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.700
It moves up and down.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.620
And that is the shape of a stressed syllable.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.860
Fresh.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.100
Fresh.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.220
Fresh.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.280
We don't want flat pitches in American English.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.440
Fresh.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.560
Fresh.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.780
- Fresh. 
- Oh yeah.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.000
Oh yeah.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.080
Oh yeah.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.380
A little unclear because my head is turned so I'm not facing the mic.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.680
Oh yeah.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.440
But you can still hear that the intonation is nice and smooth. Oh yeah.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:07.600
Oh yeah. The words linked together. There's no separation of the two words.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.540
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.880
Oh, and I was hoping--

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:19.020
Oh. Oh. This is like 'ooh' it's just a filler word, an exclamation: Oh. Oh.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.760
Do you need some lip rounding for the second half of that diphthong? Oh.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.780
Oh. Oh. And I was hoping that we wouldn't have to buy a huge bag.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.260
And I was hoping that we wouldn't have to buy a huge bag.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.180
Ho--. Buy a huge bag.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.940
These are the words that I hear being the most stressed here.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.480
The word 'and' is reduced we dropped the D: And I was-- And I was-- And I was--

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.760
And I was-- And I was-- And I was--

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.400
And in the word 'was', we reduced the vowel from
the UH as in butter to the schwa.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.820
That just means it's said even more quickly
with less jaw drop, a little less clarity.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.400
I was-- was-- was--  was--

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.760
And I was--

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.840
And I was--

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.220
And I was-- And I was-- And I was--

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.920
So these three words a little less clear

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.460
than the stress word: ho- hoping-

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.700
Flatter in pitch, said more quickly:

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.580
And I was hoping that we wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.500
And I was hoping that we wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.820
And I was hoping that we wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.540
That we wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.460
That we wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.180
What's happening here? We have: that we wouldn't have to--

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.740
and then a little bit longer on 'buy'.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.900
So how are we saying these words so quickly?

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.760
The word 'that', we reduce the vowel to the schwa

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.560
so that we can say it more quickly. That-- that-- that--

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.920
Stop T. That we-- That we-- That we--

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.380
That we wouldn't have to--

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.480
That we wouldn't have to--

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.320
That we wouldn't have to--

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.540
That we wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.160
wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.520
that we--  that we--

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.460
wouldn't have to buy--

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.520
wouldn't have to- wouldn't have to-

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.720
So again, I think I'm hearing this as a dropped T. Just an N sound going right into the H.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.920
Wouldn't have to-

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:12.840
The vowel here reduces to the schwa
and when we have an ending V linking into to,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.840
linking into the word 'to' which begins with the T,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.100
it's often in this two-word combination to change the V sound to an F because T is unvoiced.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.260
So this becomes unvoiced.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.440
The V unvoiced is the F.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.640
have to- have to- have to- have to-

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.960
Try that with me.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.840
have to- have to--

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.420
have to-- have to-- have to--

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.300
that we wouldn't have to-

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.700
that we wouldn't have to-

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.700
that we wouldn't have to-

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.900
that we wouldn't have to- that we wouldn't have to- that we wouldn't have to-

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.640
What do you have to do to be able to say those words that quickly?

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.460
We have to simplify mouth movements. We have to produce some of the sounds

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:58.380
and the pitch doesn't change as much, it stays lower and flatter. There is not quite as much energy in the voice.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:04.220
All of these things  are part of the important contrast
between stressed and unstressed syllables.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.300
That we wouldn't have to-- That we wouldn't have to-- That we wouldn't have to buy a huge bag.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.460
A huge bag- Uh- The schwa said very quickly.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:18.320
'Huge' a little bit longer and then 'bag' has more of that up-down shape of stress.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.440
a huge bag--

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.220
a huge bag-- a huge bag-- a huge bag-- How many do we need?

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.680
How many do we need? How- The question word.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.100
How many do we need--

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.820
and 'need' are the most stressed there.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.040
Many do we--

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.140
these three words are said more quickly.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.800
How many do we-- How many do we-- How many do we--

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.340
I don't reduce anything. All of the sounds stay the same.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.800
Some people it could happen that I would reduce 'do' to 'de': How many do we need?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.560
Da-da- Da-da- with the schwa. That's okay.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.560
But I actually keep the OO vowel.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:02.040
What's more important here than whether or not I make that reduction is that the word is said incredibly quickly

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.120
and then it links into the word before and the word after:

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.360
many do we-

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.540
many do we- many do we-

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.140
How many do we--  How many do we-- 
 How many do we--

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.040
And that provides a nice contrast with 'how' and 'need'.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.920
How many do we need?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.920
So it's long, short, short, short, long all with a smooth change in intonation.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.220
How many do we need? How many do we need?
How many do we need?

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.900
Let's listen to the whole conversation one more time.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.400
I just got my first weird look.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.540
But you know what? At the end of the day,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.400
- it doesn't matter.
- I know.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.480
At the end of the day, it's the students who matter.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.300
That's right.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.560
- Ok green beans.
- Ooo.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.440
Cranberries.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.560
- Fresh.
- Oh yeah.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.700
Oh, and I was hoping that we wouldn't have to buy a huge bag.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.880
How many do we need?

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.840
That analysis is really fun and helpful, right?
