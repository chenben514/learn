00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.890
In this American English pronunciation video,
you’re going to come with me to my home

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.080
state of Florida and we’re going to do a
Ben Franklin exercise where we study conversation.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.080
Today’s topic: discussing plans.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.700
&gt;&gt; Not till two.
&gt;&gt; Right, but we’re…

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.010
&gt;&gt; And maybe somewhat after that.
&gt;&gt; But we said we’d be there at 1:30.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.110
&gt;&gt; Right. I think they want to just chat,
and, you know…

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Stuff before.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.030
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Will it take, like 15 minutes to get there, or?

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.329
&gt;&gt; Oh no. It’ll take…
&gt;&gt; Ten?

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.239
&gt;&gt; Five.
&gt;&gt; Five.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.359
&gt;&gt; Not till two.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:01:00.010
I notice my dad makes a Stop T here, not till,
not till, instead of not till. That makes

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.500
the transition between these two words less
obvious, it makes it a smoother link. Not

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.760
till two.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.890
&gt;&gt; Not till two. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Right, but we’re…

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.940
&gt;&gt; And maybe somewhat after that.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.470
Another Stop T here at the end of ‘that’
because it’s the end of a thought, the end

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.840
of a sentence. Often we make those T’s Stop
T’s in American English.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.640
&gt;&gt; …somewhat after that. [3x]
&gt;&gt; But we said we’d be there at 1:30.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.670
But we. I actually dropped the T altogether
here to make this even more connected and

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.670
smooth. But we, but we. ‘But’ is a function
word, not too important, so it’s okay to

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.960
reduce it.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.530
&gt;&gt; But we said we’d [3x] be there at 1:30.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.110
Did you notice how I pronounced ‘thirty’?
I took this second T and made it a Flap T

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.950
so it sounded like a D. Thirty, thirty, 1:30.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.720
&gt;&gt; But we said we’d be there at
1:30 [3x].

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.070
This was another Stop T. And, it was very
quick, so it was hard to tell, but I think

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.430
this was a schwa, at, at. At 1:30 [2x].

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.890
&gt;&gt; Be there at 1:30. [3x]

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.299
When you’re talking about the time of something,
try pronouncing ‘at’ this way, very quickly.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.489
&gt;&gt; Right. I think they want to just…

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.150
Another Stop T here. It’s the end of a sentence.
Right.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.379
&gt;&gt; Right. [3x] I think they want to just …

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.159
Did you notice how my Dad did not make a TH
sound here, but rather just an H sound? And

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.819
he connected it to ‘I’. I think, I think,
I think.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.889
&gt;&gt; I think they want to just [3x]

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:51.400
I’ve noticed some native speakers do this
with the TH in ‘think’. We use this phrase

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.780
a lot. I think this, I think that. And it’s
not uncommon to hear the H sound instead of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.940
the TH. It’s a funny little reduction that
we do of a content word. I think they.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.189
&gt;&gt; I think they want to just [3x] chat, and…
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.099
You probably noticed the ‘wanna’ reduction
here.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.799
&gt;&gt; I think they want to [3x]

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.180
Very common in American English.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.909
&gt;&gt; I think they want to just chat, and…
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.290
Also, the word ‘just’. We often reduce
this so it sounds like there’s basically

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.620
no vowel. Just [3x], want to just [2x].

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.389
&gt;&gt; I think they want to just [3x] chat, and…
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.870
Chat. Another Stop T at the end of this thought.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.739
&gt;&gt; I think they want to just chat, and…

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.169
The word ‘and’ was very reduced, to just
the schwa-N sound, nn, nn.

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.079
&gt;&gt; Chat and [3x].
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.309
&gt;&gt; You know, stuff.

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:04.090
You know. Did you notice that this was the
schwa and not the OO as in BOO vowel? You,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.090
you, you know. We pronounce these two words
together this way all the time. You know [3x].

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.760
&gt;&gt; Chat and.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.380
&gt;&gt; You know, stuff [3x] before.
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.220
&gt;&gt; Will it take, like, fifteen minutes to
get there, or?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.310
Let’s talk about the word fifteen for a
second. Some people have a hard time hearing

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:33.020
the difference between 15 and 50. The sounds
are a little different, but also, the stress

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.020
is different. Fifteen. Stress is on the second
syllable there, -teen, -teen, fifteen. So

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:51.669
it’s short-long. For the word fifty, it’s
the opposite. It’s long-short. Fifty, fifty.

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.340
Fifteen, fifteen.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.889
&gt;&gt; Will it take, like fifteen minutes [3x]
to get there, or?

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.879
I reduced the vowel in ‘to’ to the schwa,
like we almost always do. I did keep this

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:16.469
as a True T though. The sound before was unvoiced,
ts, ts, ts. Minutes to.

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:21.180
&gt;&gt; Fifteen minutes to get there, or? [3x]

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.180
Did you notice this T? Stop T because the
next sound was a consonant, the voiced TH.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.780
Get there, get there.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.210
&gt;&gt; Fifteen minutes to get there, or? [3x]

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:45.470
How was this word pronounced? Or, or. Just
the schwa-R sound, very quick. This is another

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.729
function word, so I’ve reduced it.

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.530
&gt;&gt; To get there, or? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Oh no. It’ll take…

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.150
Did you hear Dad? He reduced ‘it will’
to the contraction ‘it’ll’. It’ll [3x].

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.989
&gt;&gt; Oh no. It’ll take [3x]
&gt;&gt; Ten?

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:05.659
&gt;&gt; Five.
&gt;&gt; Five.

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.729
What’s different about the pitch, the intonation
of these two phrases?

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.610
&gt;&gt; Ten? &gt;&gt; Five. &gt;&gt; Five.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:21.610
This one goes up in pitch, this one goes down.
That’s because I’m asking the question

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.539
here. I don’t know how long it will take.
The statement, where my dad was sure, goes

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:34.870
down in pitch. If you’re not sure, your
phrase goes up. If you’re sure, your phrase

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.120
goes down.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.120
&gt;&gt; Ten? &gt;&gt; Five. &gt;&gt; Five. [3x]

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.479
&gt;&gt; Not till two.
&gt;&gt; Right, but we’re…

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.860
&gt;&gt; And maybe somewhat after that.
&gt;&gt; But we said we’d be there at 1:30.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.910
&gt;&gt; Right. I think they want to just chat,
and, you know…

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.309
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Stuff before.

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.289
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Will it take, like 15 minutes to get there?

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.389
Or?
&gt;&gt; Oh no. It’ll take…

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:00.230
&gt;&gt; Ten?
&gt;&gt; Five.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.039
&gt;&gt; Five. Okay. So we can leave at, like, 1:25.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.589
&gt;&gt; We might as well head back anyway.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:07.069
&gt;&gt; That way we can still…
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:11.270
&gt;&gt; Stop and look at the alligators if we want.
&gt;&gt; Right. We probably won’t see much more.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.550
I was hoping to see…
&gt;&gt; No.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.740
&gt;&gt; … sandhill cranes, but.
&gt;&gt; Right. We would definitely see, we would

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.059
definitely see more alligators, but we probably
wouldn’t see anymore of anything different.

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:26.059
&gt;&gt; Well, we’ve seen enough of those I think.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:37.759
&gt;&gt; That’s it, and thanks so much for using
Rachel’s English.
