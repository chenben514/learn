00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
You guys loved my video on clothing 
vocabulary, but said you needed more.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.000
So here is a vocabulary video about shoes.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.160
We have so many different kinds of shoes, don’t we?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.000
In this video, you’ll sit down with me and 
my sister-in-law, Lisa,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.560
while we go over many kinds of shoes and other vocabulary words relating to shoes.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.180
You’ll get more comfortable pronouncing 
words like leather and ankle.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.480
You’ll learn new terms in American 
English like shearling and ‘fancy pants’.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.420
 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.300
I brought my sister-in-law Lisa here to crowdsource, help me go through some shoes.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.260
She's brought a bunch.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.180
Let's see.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.640
Probably too many.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.880
No, no such thing as too many shoes.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.900
Now Lisa just told me--

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.220
That is argument in our house.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.240
These are basketball shoes.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.140
Right these are my daughter's basketball shoes, there's more support in ankle there.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.180
Okay, I was saying I'm used to only ever seeing high-top basketball shoes.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.840
I've never seen low top basketball shoes.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.640
There we talked about two different styles of shoes:  high tops, which go above the ankle, and low tops,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.460
which go below the ankle.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.520
Pretty self-explanatory.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.440
The top of the shoe is either high or low.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.840
High tops, low tops.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.380
Say those with me.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.500
High tops, low tops.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.600
I was saying I'm used to only ever seeing high-top basketball shoes.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.000
I've never seen low top basketball shoes.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I was afraid to let her wear the low tops.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.500
I was afraid to turn her ankle.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200
But I guess it's a thing now.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.800
Okay.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.100
So...

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.300
Savannah's very athletic because she also has soccer shoes.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.280
Cleats.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.880
Cleats, you would call these.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.400
And for some reason, people like to have a very different designs.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.900
Yeah.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.900
They want their cleats to stand out and be different from anyone else's.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.120
Cleats.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.820
So we talked about basketball shoes, and now we’re talking about cleats.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.420
Cleats are shoes that have cleats for extra grip on the bottom.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.040
You can have soccer cleats, baseball cleats.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.260
A lot of sports shoes are called by the name of the sport:

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.000
basketball shoes, tennis shoes, running 
shoes, soccer cleats.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.380
For sprinters on a track, their shoes are called spikes, and the spikes are much smaller than a cleat.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.460
Cleat, cleats, KL consonant cluster, EE vowel, T.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.740
Say that with me:  cleat, cleats.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.860
The word 'spike', SP consonant cluster.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.580
some people think they should make this a B.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.480
not true.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.500
it's a very light P. sp, sp, sp.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.060
Spike.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.160
Spikes.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.840
Say those with me: spike, spikes.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.040
There’s one thing I want to say about ‘tennis shoe’.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.320
One word ends in an S, tennis, the next 
word begins with an SH, shoe.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.160
We actually link these words together and 
the SH takes over the S.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.620
You may have noticed, we don’t say tennis-shoe.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.900
Tennis shoe.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.860
We don’t make an S and then an SH.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.240
We drop the S and connect with the SH.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.980
Tenni-shoe.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.000
Tenni-shoe.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.460
Say that with me.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.160
Tennis shoe.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.420
The same is true of the word 'dress shoe'.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.560
We drop the S at the end of 'dress' and 
connect with an SH.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.680
Dress shoe.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.240
Dress shoe.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.160
A 'dress shoe' can be a term for either men's shoes or women's shoes that are more formal.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.180
So what other sports do you wear cleats in? Baseball, right?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.540
&gt;&gt; Baseball, soccer...
&gt;&gt; And track.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.240
&gt;&gt; Runners have different--
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.840
Those are called spikes.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.060
&gt;&gt; Right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.680
But similar.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.780
All right we got some boots here.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.000
Lots of boots.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.700
So this is the kind of boot I tend to wear to work in the winter.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.420
It helps keep the leg warmer.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.500
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; When it comes up high.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.200
Yeah.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.240
Is this a riding boot?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.200
Or is the riding boot the one that's black and brown?

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.160
This kind of boot can be called a 'riding boot'.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.220
It’s basically a high boot with that defined heel to fit into stirrups.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.580
Of course, most people buy them for fashion and not for horseback riding,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.560
which is what they were originally made for.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.780
Riding boot.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.420
Did you know that ‘riding’ sounds just like this word ‘writing’ because of the Flap T?

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.320
Riding, riding boot.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.020
Say that with me.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.700
Riding.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.160
Riding boot.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.540
The word 'Boot'.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.500
Here the letters OO make the oo sound, so your lips come into a tighter circle and then relax.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.840
I’ll do it slowly.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.740
Watch my lips.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.260
Boot.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.500
The movement into and out of the lip 
position is important.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.800
You don’t want them to just be a tight circle the whole time, boot, boot, boot.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.420
that sounds too closed:  boot, boot.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.840
Relax, round in, and relax.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.300
Say that with me.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.260
Boot, boot.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.760
Notice I'm making a Stop T.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.320
you can make this into a Flap T if you're connecting into a next word that begins with a vowel or diphthong.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.080
This is a knee-high boot basically.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.800
Right.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.100
It's not an above-the-knee. That's a different boot.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:43.440
There we heard two different terms to describe kinds of boots. Knee-high means it comes just below the knee.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.480
An above-the-knee boot would look like this.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.040
Say those with me.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.100
Knee-high, above-the-knee.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.840
This is a knee-high boot basically.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.680
Right.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.040
It's not an above-the-knee.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.060
That's a different boot.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.120
These are kind of ankle boots.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.620
Right.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.220
Or is it if this an ankle boot or is a boot that goes like that an ankle boot?

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.860
Or those come--
I think they both get called ankle boots.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.120
And then there's booties which is funny just because it sounds like  booties.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.960
Right.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.420
But those are the ones that are cut like that.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.260
Yeah.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.120
Ankle boots and booties.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.460
What I was holding up was an ankle boot.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.220
The pronunciation of ‘ankle’

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.280
is a little tricky because the real pronunciation doesn’t match what you’ll see in a dictionary.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.720
What you’ll see in the dictionary is this, the AA vowel followed by the NG consonant.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.740
AA-ng, ang, ang, AA-nkle.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.640
That’s not how we pronounce it.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.740
Ankle.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:50.680
The NG sound changes the AA Vowel so it’s more like the AY diphthong:  AY, ankle.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.700
Ankle boot.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.160
Say that with me.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.920
Ankle boot.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.100
Then we have bootie.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.300
This can either be a boot like this, or, it’s also something for newborn babies, like this.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.700
They’re both called booties.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.720
The T here is a Flap T because it comes between two vowels.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.220
Booties.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.840
Also, ‘bootie’ is a slang term for your butt.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.320
Booties.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.180
Booties.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.700
Say that with me.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.600
Booties.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.840
These are kind of ankle boots.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.340
Right.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.880
Or is it, is this an ankle boot or is a boot that goes like that an ankle boot?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.280
Or those come--
I think they both get called ankle boots.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.580
And then there's booties which is funny just because it sounds like booties.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.640
Booty, right.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.140
But those are the ones that are cut like that.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.980
Yeah.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.840
Suede.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.900
And suede definitely.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.800
So this is leather.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.780
Different from suede.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.520
Leather and suede.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.620
Two common types of materials that 
shoes are made of Leather.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.600
This has that tricky TH.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.780
Here it’s voiced, th, th, leather.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.920
Notice it’s just the very tip of the tongue that comes through the teeth.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:10.220
Leath, th, leather, leather.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.580
Your tongue tip is already forward for the EH vowel, for that, it’s just behind the teeth.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.900
So to make the TH, just bring it up, put it out a bit, and then bring your teeth together.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.060
Leath- th, th, th, leather.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.940
Say that with me.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.640
Leather.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.860
Suede.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.460
SW consonant cluster, the AY diphthong.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.000
Sue-- suede.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.980
Usually the SW cluster is written with the letters S-W.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:47.500
But in a few cases, like ‘suede’ or ‘suite’, it’s written with the letters S-U.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.600
Suede.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.060
Say that with me.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.440
Suede.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.340
Suede.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.520
And suede definitely.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.480
So this is leather.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.100
Different from suede.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.840
This one's got shearling inside.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.040
Mm-hmm.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.680
Right.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.660
That's a, that is a cozy looking boot.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.680
Shearling is that wooly stuff inside, lining the boot.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.180
Very warm and comfortable in the winter.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:19.220
The word ‘shearling’ can refer to a sheep who has had his wool cut off, or the wool itself.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.740
This word would be written with the IH as in SIT vowel,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:28.700
but when that’s followed by an R consonant in a stressed syllable, it’s more like the EE vowel,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:33.720
Shea— shearr-- shearling.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.520
Shearling.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.940
Say that with me.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.320
Shearling.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.180
Suede.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.340
And suede definitely.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.200
So this is leather.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.020
Different from suede.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.460
This one's got shearling inside.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.820
Mm-hmm.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.440
Right.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.500
That's a, that is a cozy looking boot.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.680
That's what i wear around the house in the winter because i get such cold feet.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.600
Did you hear my sister-in-law say she wears these boots around the house in the winter

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.040
because she gets ‘such cold feet’?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.200
Her feet are cold!

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.780
That’s the literal meaning of this phrase.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.940
But we also use ‘cold feet’ as an idiom and that means something totally different.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.260
Do you know this idiom?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:21.340
You’ll learn it here next week when we make a video that goes over idioms related to shoes like cold feet,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.240
big shoes to fill, and a shoestring budget.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.960
So be sure to come back to find that video here next week, Tuesday morning, Eastern time.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.820
That's what I wear around the house in the winter because I get such cold feet.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.080
Cold feet.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.600
We'll do that next week in the idioms video.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.360
&gt;&gt; That'll be a fun one.
&gt;&gt; That'll be a fun one.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.640
&gt;&gt; I shoe do wish I could see that one now!
&gt;&gt; You shoe do!

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:56.060
Lisa said ‘shoe do’ instead of ‘sure do’, ‘I 
sure do wish I could’.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.420
This is a pun, a play on words since we’re talking about shoes.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.200
Okay, here we have clogs.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.340
Yes. those are clogs.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.020
Classic.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.520
Lot of clogs have a wooden sole. These are rubber.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.760
Mm-hmm.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.220
Still called a clog.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.360
Clog.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.640
We also talked about two possible materials for the sole of the shoes,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.980
that is, the part on the bottom that touches the street.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.020
They can be wooden, made of wood, or rubber.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.780
Clog.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.640
The letter O makes the AH as in FATHER sound here.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640
Clog.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.080
Say that with me.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.580
Clog.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.740
When we went over ‘boot’, you learned the 
letters OO make the OO sound.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:52.300
Here, in ‘wood’ or ‘wooden’, they make the UH as in PUSH vowel.  Uh, woo-, wood, wooden.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:12:02.000
Remember ‘wood’ and ‘would’ are homophones – their pronunciation is the same.  Wood, wooden.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.700
Say these with me.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.600
Wood, wooden.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.700
So here are some more suede boots and these have a lower heel than others.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.740
There's different heights of heels go with different outfits.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.760
This is high.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.280
This is a high heel.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.640
That's a high bootie.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.560
Yes. This is a high bootie, ankle boot, I cannot wear shoes this high.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.940
I, sometimes I wear shoes when I need a tall attitude.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.440
Yeah.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.000
Those are tall attitude shoes.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.340
I have noticed that you're pretty good about being able to wear pretty high heels.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.300
You have to just make sure they're comfortable.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.540
Otherwise...

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.160
See, that to me, it's like not a thing.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.180
It can't happen. Right.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.920
Very high heels, not comfortable.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.380
These tend to not be as comfortable, but when we get to my platforms...

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.220
Okay.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.580
&gt;&gt; Those are, even though those are high. 
&gt;&gt; Let's see 'em.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.840
&gt;&gt; Here's another...
&gt;&gt; So these boots...

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.040
Knee-high boot with studs.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.620
Yeah.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.200
&gt;&gt; Low-heel.
&gt;&gt; I brought those just 'cause of the studs.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.560
So we’re talking about heel height.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.640
A low heel, a high heel.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.600
Just like ‘wood’ and ‘would’ are homophones, ‘heel’, which refers to the part of the shoe

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.600
that goes under your heel, the part of your foot, is a homophone with H-E-A-L,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.000
like when you heal from an injury.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.240
H-E-E-L refers to a part of a sole, but also 
a part of a foot.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.280
Heel.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.900
Say that with me.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.220
Heel.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.180
You also saw studs on that boot.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.740
A decoration that can go on something 
like a shoe, belt, or jacket.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.420
Stud, studs.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.500
With the UH as in Butter vowel.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.880
Say those with me.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.460
Stud, studs.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.900
&gt;&gt; Here's another...
&gt;&gt; So these boots...

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.080
Knee-high boot with studs.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.580
Yeah.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.180
&gt;&gt; Low-heel. 
&gt;&gt; I brought those just 'cause of the studs.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.080
Converse.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.100
&gt;&gt; Woah! Woah, my goodness.
&gt;&gt; So this is...

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.800
What have we here?

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.240
These are some fancypants, spikey heeled,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.580
sandals that you can't dance in but of 
course this is what kids wear to prom!

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.240
So that's what I brought these for.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.640
Savannah had worn these...

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.380
&gt;&gt; 'Cause they're very dressy. 
&gt;&gt; To prom one year.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.020
So very dressy.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:13.260
Okay, so we heard some terms there.  
You heard ‘fancy pants’ and ‘dressy’.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.560
‘Dressy’ is when you wear clothes that are more formal.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.100
Not every-day clothes, not even work clothes or business attire, but dressy.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.460
You could say, “we need to dress up for this event.”

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.660
Dress up.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:32.640
That means you have to wear dressy clothes, more formal clothes, like what you might wear to a wedding.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.460
“Fancy pants” is just a more playful way to say ‘dressy’.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.100
It doesn’t have anything to do with pants specifically.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.160
Say these with me: dressy, dressy.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.860
Dress up.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.140
Fancy pants.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.840
Lisa called the shoes spikey-heeled sandals.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.620
So she described the heel as being like a 
spike, tall and slim,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.380
and the shoes are sandals because of the 
straps, an open feel.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:10.600
Sandal has the AA followed by N in the stressed syllable, which makes it ‘aa-uh’ instead of  a pure ‘aa’.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.720
Sa-- san-- sandal.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.600
Sandal.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.800
Try that with me.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.940
Sandal.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.340
Sandal.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.020
Converse.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.060
&gt;&gt; Woah! Woah, my goodness.
&gt;&gt; So this is...

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.800
What have we here?

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.240
These are some fancypants, spikey-heeled,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.360
sandals that you can't dance in but of course this is what kids wear to prom!

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.240
So that's what I brought these for.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.620
Savannah had worn these...

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.480
&gt;&gt; 'Cause they're very dressy. 
&gt;&gt; To prom one year.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.540
So very dressy, um, you know, I...they were...

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.220
yeah.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.060
&gt;&gt; Sandals.
&gt;&gt; Worn for an hour maybe.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.760
&gt;&gt; Open-toe.
&gt;&gt; And then taken off.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.840
Another term, open-toe.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.780
This means, of course, that the toes are exposed.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.980
Open-toe.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.360
Say that with me.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.600
Open-toe.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.000
&gt;&gt; Open-toe.
&gt;&gt; And then taken off.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.060
Now, see, this isn't quite a stiletto.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.520
A stiletto is where this is maybe a quarter-inch wide max.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.220
Right.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.520
Really comes to a point.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.760
Very thin.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.560
So it's a high heel, not quite a stiletto, sandal, open-toed.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.840
Stiletto.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.460
Not the most comfortable shoe out there.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:27.620
The double T here is a Flap T because it comes between two vowels and doesn’t start a stressed syllable.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.960
Stiletto.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.940
Not ‘stiletto’.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.840
Ttt--

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.320
But stiletto, da-da-da, stiletto.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.840
Say that with me.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.300
Stiletto.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.400
Now, see, this isn't quite a stiletto.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.000
A stiletto is where this is maybe a quarter-inch wide max.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.540
Right.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.980
Really comes to a point.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.120
Very thin.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:54.020
So it's a high heel, not quite a stiletto, sandal, open-toed.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.820
Don't think we'll ever understand that prom culture.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.640
Oh, these dressy ones, I wore to your wedding.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.140
Nice!

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.920
Sometimes, when you want to do something dressier, you'll have like a little flower on there.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.160
Closed toe.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.740
&gt;&gt; Ankle strap.
&gt;&gt; Or, I don't know, ankle strap,

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.460
I guess you would ca ll that.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.320
So is this-- This is a pump, wouldn't you call that a pump, Christina?

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.580
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.940
Even with the ankle strap?

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.440
Yep.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.140
Yep.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.300
Still a pump.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.500
Pump, ankle strap, closed-toe.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:26.740
A pump is a high-heel that’s not a boot or a sandal. It’ can be a peep-toe.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.060
What's peep-toe?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.580
I actually have a peep-toe clog right here.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:37.020
So peep toe is on a pump or it could be in 
a two-part sandal like this

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.960
where there's a little bit cut out where just the toes would come through, but the rest is covered.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.900
They're just peeping through.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.300
Peep toe.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.980
Say that with me.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.500
Peep toe.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.600
An ankle strap, that’s self explanatory.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.980
Closed-toe shoe.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.080
The opposite of open-toe, the toes are not exposed.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.500
Notice you don’t really hear the D here.  It comes between Z and T,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.020
and sometimes we drop the D between two other consonants.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.660
It gets lost here in the other sounds.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.940
You can just drop it and connect Z to T.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.040
Closed-toe.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.820
Closed-toe.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.780
Closed-toe shoe.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.160
Say that with me.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.580
Closed-toe shoe.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.680
Oh, these dressy ones, I wore to your wedding.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.180
Nice!

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.800
Sometimes, when you want to do something dressier, you'll have like a little flower on there.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.320
Closed toe.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.860
&gt;&gt; Ankle strap.
&gt;&gt; Or, I don't know, ankle strap,

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.020
I guess you would call that.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.280
So is this-- This is a pump, wouldn't you call that a pump, Christina?

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.380
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.940
Even with the ankle strap?

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.440
Yep.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.060
Yep.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.800
Still a pump.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.420
Now these, eventhough they look high-ish,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:50.200
if you think about the platform, there'll be another...it's really not much of...

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.180
But I love these because I feel tall in them.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.620
And they're comfortable.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.460
I'm a big fan of platforms.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:56.960
Yeah.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.980
'Cause as someone who's short, I also like to have some height but I can't handle it all being in the heel.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.280
So I love to do platforms. I actually like flatforms. Have you heard this phrase before?

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:06.780
No.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:13.020
It's when the toe part and the heel part are basically the same height.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.280
I might have some flatforms.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.460
Flip flops.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, flatform flip flops!
&gt;&gt; I don't think I brought those though.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.800
That's okay.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.740
Platform and flatform.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:30.260
Platform shoes have some height under the toe, and even more under the heel like Lisa’s boots.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:38.980
Flatforms have a more or less equal throughout, like these. I have a pair of orange flatforms which I love.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:47.100
So the heel is a little bit higher than the toe but not much. I think this still counts as a flatform shoe.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.440
Flatform is a word that was made up recently, it's a play on words.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.140
It’s a platform, but your foot is flat instead of having a higher heel.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:03.440
I did notice, this word has been taken up by several online dictionaries like MacMillian, Oxford, and Collins.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.500
So I guess we can say it's an official word now.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.940
Platform, flatform.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.600
Say those with me.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.480
Platform, flatform.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.380
I'm a big fan of platforms.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.880
Yeah.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.880
'Cause as someone who's short, I also like to have some height but I can't handle it all being in the heel.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.320
So I love to do platforms. I actually like flatforms. Have you heard this phrase before?

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:25.820
No.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:31.960
It's when the toe part and the heel part are basically the same height.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.380
I might have some flatforms.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.540
Flip flops.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.200
&gt;&gt; Oh, flatform flip flops!
&gt;&gt; I don't think I brought those though.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.420
That's okay.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.940
But these platforms, these sandals...

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.640
Yeah.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.500
I wear these to work and they're very comfortable.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.040
Really?

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.940
And you'd never guess.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.000
But if you think about it, it's really only that much of a wedge heel.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.480
Yes. And that's called a wedge because the whole thing is filled in.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:21:00.020
This one we have the heel and then the toe part so because of this, this is not a wedge. But that's a wedge.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.900
Wedge.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.580
A wedge shoe.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.420
Something that’s thick and then tapers.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.040
It’s also a verb we use to cram something into a tight space.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:16.260
For example, I can’t wedge one more thing into my suitcase, it’s totally full.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.540
Wedge.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.960
Say that with me.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.400
Wedge.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.040
Yes. And that's called a wedge because the whole thing is filled in.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:31.000
This one we have the heel and then the toe part so because of this, this is not a wedge. But that's a wedge.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.040
Good point.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.620
Oh, are these hiking shoes?

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.740
Yes. These are my waterproof hiking boots.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.880
Oh, boots, yeah.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.280
And they really did keep me dry.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:46.760
So yeah, this was important when I was hiking in Iceland, it was very wet this summer.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.920
Hiking boots or shoes, water-proof.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:55.140
Just like we talked about earlier with running shoes, basketball shoes, tennis shoes.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.920
This shoe is named by what you use it for.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.900
Hiking.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.580
You need good treads on the bottom to help prevent slipping as you’re going down a mountain.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.480
You need good ankle support.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:11.820
You can have a hiking shoe, which goes below the ankle, or a hiking boot, which goes above the ankle.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.620
Hiking boot, hiking shoe.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.260
Say those with me.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.800
Hiking boot, hiking shoe.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.860
Waterproof.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.860
A very good quality to have in certain shoes.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.920
This means water can't get in.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.080
Waterproof.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.480
We have a Flap T in WATER, wa-da-da-da-da.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.700
Water.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.120
Water.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.320
Waterproof.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.800
Say that with me.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.320
Waterproof.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.540
Yes. These are my waterproof hiking boots.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.620
Oh, boots, yeah.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.100
And they really did keep me dry.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.980
So yeah, this was important when I was hiking in Iceland, it was very wet this summer.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.580
Mm-hmm.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.520
And my toes were so warm.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.280
So this is a boot instead of a shoe because it comes up a little bit higher where the ankle would be.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:58.780
Right.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.320
I have hiking shoes.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.820
So then are your shoes lower?

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.800
It's cut like a sneaker.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.840
But it's that solid base, it's that same waterproof idea.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:15.040
Actually, I had to get rid of them because I propped my feet too close to the camp fire once.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.060
I do that a lot.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.980
When you ‘get rid of’ something, you 
throw it away or give it way.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:27.140
Unfortunately, I had to throw away these shoes out because the campfire melted the soles.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.000
I also said the word ‘sneaker’ there.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.180
This is a generic term for a shoe that you could wear for sports.  It can be a high top or a low top.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.620
Sneaker.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.540
Ending, unstressed, quick schwa-R, er, er, er, sneaker.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.700
Sneaker.  Say that with me.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.860
Sneaker.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.980
Okay, now these, I was really hoping someone had an example of these.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.280
Mmm cowboy boots.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.940
Cowboy boots.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.780
Now, these are like pretty intense.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.420
That is a pointy toe.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.840
I do have different variations of cowboy boots when I want to be real serious about it,

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.120
these are the ones I go to.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.580
'Cause it has the pointy toe, and there's 
stitching on the side.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:12.360
And this sort of shape up top, leather, and yeah, the embroidery, low-ish heel.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.900
&gt;&gt; That's sort of what makes a cowboy boots. 
&gt;&gt; Straps to pull them on.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.400
Right.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.100
There's no zipper or snaps or anything.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.400
Cowboy boot.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.560
We tend to call them that even when girls wear them.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.260
Cowboy, stress on the first syllable.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.660
Cowboy boot.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.280
Say that with me.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.720
Cowboy boot.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.160
Also, I said the phrase ‘pointy toe’, which means the toe box of the shoe is very pointed.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.760
I said ‘pointy’ with a T.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.340
And when Lisa said it, she said ‘poinny’, without a T.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.700
Why?  It’s common to drop the T after N.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.500
If you’re not going to drop it, then it’s a True T.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.240
Pointy or ‘poinny’.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.340
Either pronunciation is okay.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.180
Listen to that part again.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.000
Cowboy boots.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.660
Cowboy boots.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.400
Now, these are like pretty intense.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.240
That is a pointy toe.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.660
I do have different variations of cowboy boots when I want to be real serious about it,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.040
these are the ones I go to.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.300
'Cause it has the pointy toe, and there's stitching on the side.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:19.040
And this sort of shape up top, leather, and yeah, the embroidery, low-ish heel.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.640
&gt;&gt; That's sort of what makes a cowboy boots.
&gt;&gt; Straps to pull them on.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.140
Right.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.660
There's no zipper or snaps or anything.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.560
Cowboy boot.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.400
What are these with the laces?

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.040
So these are my snow boots.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.620
And they're nice and fuzzy inside.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.260
So this is what I wear to walk the dog in the winter.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:44.880
You wouldn't be able to wear those other fuzzy ones because they would just get saturated and wet.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.180
Okay so these are your waterproof, lace-up, snowboots.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:49.880
&gt;&gt; Snowboots.
&gt;&gt; Snowboots.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.100
&gt;&gt; Snowboots.
&gt;&gt; Snowboots, yeah.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.360
Snow boots.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:26:00.360
Depending on where you live, you must have these to survive winter.  They’re warm and they’re waterproof.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.960
Snow boots.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.100
OH diphthong.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.560
Snow.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.820
Snowboots.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.320
Say that with me.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.200
Snow boots.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.380
You can also have rain boots, which you want to be waterproof but they don't have to be so warm.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.740
But they’re usually pretty hot because 
they’re made out of rubber.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.640
Rain boots, there are other terms for 
these shoes too, like galoshes.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.300
Galoshes, make sure you’re saying that 
with a schwa in that first syllable.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.920
Ga-, ga-, galoshes.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.000
Rain boots.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.960
Here are my rainboots.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.120
Pretty simple. Green. Easy to slip on and take off.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.660
Rain boots, galoshes.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.480
Say those with me.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.980
Rain boots, galoshes.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:49.040
When discussing snow boots, we 
mentioned that they are lace-up.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:58.860
This is different from Velcro, like Stoney’s shoes, let me show you, his cute little sandals.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.800
That's the sound of velcro, isn't it?

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.380
So you can have lace-up, you can have 
velcro, you can have slip-ons.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:10.540
Slip-ons are shoes that don’t fasten in any 
way like my rain boots.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:16.700
An example of a slip-on would also be a 
loafer, which is a shoe shaped like this.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.460
Say those with me.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:24.960
Lace up, Velcro, slip on, loafer.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.220
Notice in lace up and slip on, we have a linking ending consonant into beginning vowel.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.380
Sup.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.060
Lace up.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.000
Pon.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.200
Slip on.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.080
And then that brings us to one of my favorites because this means summer.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.620
&gt;&gt; Flip flops.
&gt;&gt; Flip flops.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:48.860
Although I do have those flatform type flip flops too that make me nice and high.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.700
Flip-flops.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.440
This is by far the most common term in America to refer to these shoes,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.100
and other countries have other terms used, like thongs.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:27:59.940
Flip-flops.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.840
Two FL clusters, the first word is stressed.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:10.860
Flip-- Close your lips for the first P, but don’t release it, pp.  Just go right into the next F.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.080
Flip----flops.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.660
Flip-flops.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.020
Flip-flops. Say that with me.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.600
Flip-flops.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.000
Have you ever heard the term ‘boat shoe’?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.320
It’s a pretty common style in the US in summer.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.380
Originally developed, I suppose, for boating, now an everyday shoe.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:37.320
Lisa didn’t have any work boots, but these are shoes you would use to do dirty, maybe outdoor work.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.200
Yard work, construction, you name it.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.180
They’re often made of leather or rubber.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.320
Definitely not a shoe you would wear to the office.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.620
Work boots.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.040
Say that with me.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.120
Work boots.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.580
And what about when you’re home relaxing?

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.900
Then you might slip into something more comfortable, slippers.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:04.760
Something you wear around the house.  You can slip them on easily, the don’t tie, snap or zip.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.140
Slippers.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.660
Say that with me.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.880
Slippers.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.160
One kind of shoe Lisa didn't have is a flat.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:19.460
I don't really have a flat either but I do have this shoe which is almost flat. It's got a very low heel.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.320
But a flat is a shoe that's this shape with 
basically no heel.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.220
Flat.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.760
Sometimes they're called ballet flats because they look a little bit like a ballet slipper.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.060
Say that with me.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.880
Flat.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.740
Flats.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.260
What’s your favorite shoe, and why?

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.340
Let me know in the comments below.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.420
If you’re seeing this on Facebook, post a picture of your favorite shoes in the comments!

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.220
What about clothes?

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.480
I made a popular clothing vocabulary video you’ll want to be sure to check out,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.800
along with all of my vocabulary builder videos.

That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.
