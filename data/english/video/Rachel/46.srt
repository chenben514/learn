00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.170
I recently did a Word of the Week on the word
'burrito'. And I had some people ask me, what

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.570
is a burrito? So today, 
we're going to eat one.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.870
Let's go eat our burritos!

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.380
First, a quick stop to pick up laundry.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; You don't do your laundry at all anymore?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.699
&gt;&gt; I don't because I don't have a washer/dryer
in my building. [2x]

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.870
Let's take a look at this sentence. Can you
hear how Lynne doesn't pronounce the T in

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.289
'don't' as a True T? Often with these N'T
contractions like don't, can't, and won't,

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:53.569
that's the case. Instead, we mix the N and
Stop T to make a nasally Stop sound: nn, nn.

00:00:53.569 --> 00:01:02.249
Don't, won't, can't. nnn. Don't.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.820
I don't [3x]. I don't because I don't have
a washer/dryer in my building.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.170
Lynne takes all of these less important words:
because, I, don't, have, and a, and says them

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.780
very quickly, all linked together.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.049
because I don't have a [6x]

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.560
This is what we do with the words that aren't
as important to the meaning, the function

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.270
words. The nouns 'washer' and 'dryer' are
stressed, so they're longer and more clear.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.140
washer/dryer [3x]

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.270
In this sentence, the words 'washer' and 'dryer'
take about 50% longer to say than all of the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.259
words 'because I don't have a'. So always
remember, function words will generally be

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.519
very fast, even if there are a lot of them to-
gether. With content words, take a bit more time.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:05.449
I don't because I don't have a washer/dryer
in my building. [3x]

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:08.670
&gt;&gt; That's true.
&gt;&gt; So.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you. There it is. Bye. Have a good day.
&gt;&gt; Bye!

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.010
&gt;&gt; That's a huge burrito, Beads.
&gt;&gt; It's huge! So big. I think I'm going to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.639
eat half now and half later.
&gt;&gt; That's very smart.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.310
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.700
I think I'm gonna eat: what are the stressed
syllables there? da-DA-da-da-da-DA. 'Think'

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:43.349
and 'eat' are just a bit longer. 'Going to'
is reduced to 'gonna'. Also, do you notice

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:53.750
the Stop T in 'eat'? it's not 'eat', with
a released, True T. Eat, eat. You must stop

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.549
the air to make the stop T. Otherwise it sounds
like 'eaaaa'. Too long, and the voice comes

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.629
down in pitch. We don't want that. It will
be a little more abrupt and straighter in

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.510
pitch when you stop the air, eat, eat. That's
how we hear it as a Stop T.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.280
I think I'm gonna eat [3x] half now and half
later.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.370
I think I'm gonna eat half now and half later.
&gt;&gt; That's very smart.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.629
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:29.849
&gt;&gt; Now people were asking, what is a burrito?
So, as you can see, it's a big flour tortilla

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.319
with good things inside.
&gt;&gt; What did you get?

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.950
&gt;&gt; I got a beef burrito.
&gt;&gt; I got just the vegetable. I've been feeling

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.099
vegetarian lately. But I think I'm going to
be like you and cut mine in half.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.900
&gt;&gt; I think that's a good plan.
&gt;&gt; Right at the beginning.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.930
&gt;&gt; Mm. Yummy. So it looks like this has rice,
beans, guacamole, and I think sour cream and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.900
lettuce. You know what, the peas must be in
the rice.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.260
&gt;&gt; Probably, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think you're right.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.500
&gt;&gt; Mm. That is very good guacamole.
&gt;&gt; Guacamole is made with, the main ingredient

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.290
is avocado. It looks like they also have cilantro,
tomato, probably some lime juice, don't you think?

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.070
Did you hear how I combined the T with the
Y sound of YOU to make the CH sound? Lots

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:31.010
of native speakers will do this when the word
'you' is preceded by the T. Don-chew. [2x]

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.170
Listen again.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.890
&gt;&gt; Don't you think? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Yes, probably.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.840
&gt;&gt; And...
&gt;&gt; Onion.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.560
&gt;&gt; Onion.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to zoom the guacamole directly

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.050
to the camera.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.510
&gt;&gt; So, when I posted my video about burrito,
I got a couple comments about 'Well, that's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.100
not how it's actually pronounced', because
we do borrow it from Spanish. And of course,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.030
in Spanish, they might roll their R, and they
certainly don't make a Flap T like we do.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I thought it was a really interesting

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.250
discussion that happened online. When one
language absorbs the word of another language,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.730
is it ok to, in our case, Americanize it,
use your own speech habits, or is that an

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.370
insult, is that wrong? I mean, I think it's
really a matter of opinion.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.310
&gt;&gt; Um, yeah, I think it's a matter of opinion.
Sometimes I think that when you try... In

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.060
my experience, when I've tried to pronounce
words as if they were in the other language,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.070
like an Italian word, or a Spanish word, sometimes
other Americans think it's funny.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.910
&gt;&gt; It's true.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they think that I'm, they make fun

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.910
of me a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Right. Well, Lynne has studied a lot of

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.550
foreign language, as have I, both being singers
of, you know, Italian, French, German, etc.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.050
So it comes more naturally probably, to us,
to pronounce things in their native language.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.060
But, you're very right. It's not uncommon
to say 'Bach', for example, and have someone

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.030
think you're being a little snooty.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A little bit pretentious.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.280
&gt;&gt; Right. That's a good word. Because the
truth is, in American English, it is burrito.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.220
&gt;&gt; Yes!
&gt;&gt; And a lot of people eat burritos. It's

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.450
not like, I mean, it's almost as ubiquitous
as the hamburger. Not quite, but, it's getting

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.780
there.
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's a common food that Americans

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.910
eat often.
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah. I appreciate your perspective.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; And I appreciate all the conversation about

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.690
the pronunciation of that word that happened
on Facebook.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Ok, we're going to finish our burritos.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.290
&gt;&gt; That's it, and thanks so much for using
Rachel's English.
