00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.650
In this American English pronunciation video,
you’re going to come with me and my parents

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.730
to Colorado. You’ll get to see some of the
natural beauty of this state, and study American

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.850
English pronunciation in real life.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.240
Today’s topics: How to pronounce ‘river’,
gorge, the noun and the verb, the idioms ‘to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.339
keep your eyes peeled’ and ‘keep an eye
out’. Also, the pronunciation of ‘moose’

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.220
and ‘elk’.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.140
&gt;&gt; One neat feature of Colorado is the Colorado
river. Now, it might not look like too much

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.719
here, but this is the river that carved out
the Grand Canyon in Arizona.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.229
I was lucky enough to visit the Grand Canyon
on my Epic Road Trip Across America this summer.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.219
&gt;&gt; The word ‘river’ is a two-syllable
word with stress on the first syllable. DA-da.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.739
River. It begins with an R consonant. When
the R comes at the beginning of a word, the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.979
lips to make a tight circle for that, rr,
and the tongue is pulled back. For me, the

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.939
middle part is touching the roof of the mouth
about here, rr, the tip isn’t touching anything.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.490
Then we have the IH vowel, so the jaw will
drop just a bit and the tongue will come forward.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.530
Riv-.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.299
&gt;&gt; Then for the V, the bottom lip will come
up and make contact with the bottom of the

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.079
top front teeth. Riv-er. Then we have the
schwa-R ending, so the tongue will come back

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.689
into position for the R. The jaw doesn’t
need to drop. River, river.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.799
River.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.759
&gt;&gt; We’ve stopped here to take a look at
the Byer’s Gorge. A gorge is a deep, rocky

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.039
ravine. And, as you can see, we have these
nice, beautiful rock faces going up on either

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.039
side. And I think it’s just beautiful. In
this case, the Colorado river is what’s

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.679
flowing down, uh, in the middle. I suppose
it is what has worn the edges of the mountains

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.769
down.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.290
&gt;&gt; Gorge is sort of a tricky word. It starts
with the G consonant, then it has the AW as

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.290
in LAW, but the tongue must pull straight
back for the R consonant, gor-, gor-, -ge.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:30.909
And it ends with the J as in JAR consonant
sound. Gorge. It’s gorgeous!

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.840
&gt;&gt; Well gorge also has the meaning of eating
too much food, when you gorge out.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.080
&gt;&gt; That’s true.
&gt;&gt; On a bunch of food.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.360
&gt;&gt; That’s true. So this is the noun gorge,
and the verb gorge: stuffing your face, basically.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.459
&gt;&gt; That’s right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.069
&gt;&gt; And it’s sort of funny in that, in the
one, gorge is hollowing out, cutting away

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.060
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; …this big ravine

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.049
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; … in the mountains, and on the other,

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.610
gorge is filling up.
&gt;&gt; Right. Stuffing!

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.610
&gt;&gt; Way too much.
&gt;&gt; That’s interesting.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.209
So, gorge the noun is a narrow valley, like
you saw, typically with rock walls and a river

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.930
or stream running through it. The verb has
a completely different meaning, to eat a lot

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.629
of food, to stuff yourself. The word comes
from a word meaning throat.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.930
Next we drove to Rocky Mountain national park
to see elk and moose.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.400
&gt;&gt; Okay, so keep your eyes peeled for both
elk and moose.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.760
Keep your eyes peeled means to watch for something.
We use it with ‘for’, which you know we

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.799
like to reduce. Keep your eyes peeled for
moose and elk.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.970
&gt;&gt; So keep your eyes peeled for both elk and
moose.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.160
&gt;&gt; Dad, what’s the other idiom we came up
with for this?

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.670
&gt;&gt; Uh, keep an eye out for elk and moose.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.420
As we drive, we’ll keep an eye out for moose
and elk.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.430
&gt;&gt; Keep an eye out for elk and moose.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Keep an eye out is not the same thing

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.660
as keep an eye on.
&gt;&gt; No. That’s correct.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.100
&gt;&gt; If we had some elk here, we could keep
an eye on them. But since we don’t have

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.770
any and we’re looking for them, we’re
keeping an eye out for them.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.660
Keep an eye on means to watch or pay attention
to something. For example, keep an eye on

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.660
the time so you’re not late.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.120
&gt;&gt; Elk has the EH as in BED vowel. A lot of
jaw drop. Then the Dark L, so the back part

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:58.070
of your tongue has to pull back, el-k. Then
the K. So lift your tongue to the soft palate,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.069
and release. Elk.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:12.150
&gt;&gt; It’s fun being able to get so close.
There’s two here, which brings me to the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:21.400
point that the plural of elk is elk. You don’t
add an S or anything. One elk, two elk.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.780
We got lots of good views of elk. But I really
wanted to see a moose. I only saw them at

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.780
a distance, sitting down. We had been looking
the whole day, and I was starting to think

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.139
I wouldn’t see one. Then, just before it
was dark out…

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:44.039
&gt;&gt; I feel very luck to be seeing my first
moose. Moose is an easy pronunciation. It’s

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:50.169
the M consonant sound, the OO as in BOO vowel,
and the S consonant sound. Plural, just like

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:57.990
‘elk’, adds no s. It’s still just moose.
One moose, a herd of moose. Isn’t it beautiful?

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.440
This is a female, so it doesn’t have the
antlers.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:07.770
I hope you enjoyed this study of real life
American English in the beautiful Rocky Mountain

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.770
National Park. That’s it, and thanks so
much for using Rachel’s English.
