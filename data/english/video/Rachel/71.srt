00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.710
In this video, we're going to talk about how
to pronounce the word 'Christmas,' and you'll

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.710
see some scenes from my Christmas party and
from Christmastime in New York. 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.439
The word 'Christmas.'
First, let's point out that the T is silent.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.230
Christmas, Christmas. So it's the first syllable

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.680
that's accented. And the CH here represents
the K consonant sound. So the first sound

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.950
is the KR consonant cluster, Chr-, Chr-.
The vowel in the first syllable is the 'ih'

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:53.670
as in 'sit' vowel. Chri-, Chri-. This syllable
ends with the S sound. Chris-, Chris-. The

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.300
second syllable, unaccented, has the M consonant
sound, schwa, S sound. -mes, -mes. It will

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.780
be lower in pitch than the first syllable,
which is stressed. Christmas, Christmas. As

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.780
I've been discussing Christmas and Christmas
plans with my students this week, I noticed

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.930
that several of them have a misconception
about the schwa-S sound. A lot of my current

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.700
students have a native language of Mandarin.
And I've noticed not just with this word,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.190
but with others, that the schwa-S sometimes
sounds like it has an R in it. So, Christmas

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:45.549
becomes Christmers, er, er, ers. And focus
becomes focurs. Famous becomes famours, rs.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.060
So to prevent this from happening, make sure
the tongue does not pull back. The er sound

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.880
is made when the tongue pulls back some. So,
in this second syllable, -mas, -mas, -mas,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.950
the tongue can stay forward the whole time
for the schwa and the S sound. Christmas,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.029
Christmas. At our holiday party this year,
we had a wonderful meal followed by a gift

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:19.400
exchange and cookie decorating. In our gift
exchange, we each brought one gift. Then we

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.459
drew numbers to determine the order in which
to open gifts. When it was your turn, you

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.389
could either steal a gift that had already
been opened, or open a new gift yourself.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:39.809
&gt;&gt; OK, so I draw my number. I want to make
sure I get the best one. Now, no one else

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:47.989
can see, except for my Rachel's English users.
&gt;&gt; K, Tim has drawn number one, the lucky duck.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.909
Lucky duck is an idiom you can use for someone

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:59.059
who has good fortune. In our gift exchange,
whoever drew number one got to go first, but

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:06.919
then take his choice of all the open gifts at
the end. Lucky duck. Both words have the 'uh'

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:14.769
as in 'butter' sound followed by the K sound.
Uk, uk. Lucky duck. Listen again.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.229
&gt;&gt; K, Tim has drawn number one, the lucky
duck.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.779
&gt;&gt; Tim, I feel like you rigged that somehow.
&gt;&gt; I hope that you don't need a scissors.

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:29.930
Just tear the paper.
&gt;&gt; That is some tea that I brought back from

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.879
Africa in May.
&gt;&gt; Whoa! That's an awesome gift.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.469
&gt;&gt; Oh wow! I love how excited you are about
it!

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:48.220
&gt;&gt; Who's number 7? I am! I steal!
&gt;&gt; NO!

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:58.000
&gt;&gt; Pinkberry! This is a delicious frozen yogurt--uh--place
that's not so far from the house. Sorry Janae.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.060
&gt;&gt; Janae!
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.159
&gt;&gt; That cookie is so adorable!
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.340
&gt;&gt; How long did it take you?
&gt;&gt; Approximately 30 seconds.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.489
&gt;&gt; You know that we have 5,000 more to do,
right?

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.439
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; K.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:22.320
Did you notice? I reduced the word 'okay'
to simply 'k', k. Listen again.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.770
&gt;&gt; You know that we have 5,000 more to do,
right?

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.810
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; K.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.680
&gt;&gt; Jovon, that's also some excellent handy
work.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.050
&gt;&gt; Tell her about the dots.
Tell her about the dots. Did you notice the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:44.530
dropped H? It's not uncommon to drop the beginning
H in unaccented words like her, him, and his.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:52.100
If you do this, always link it to the word
before. Tell her, tell her. Tell her about

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.780
the dots. Listen again.
&gt;&gt; Tell her about the dots [x3]

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.349
&gt;&gt; The dots. This is actually braille for
'cookie'.

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.780
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're really gifted.
&gt;&gt; Linds, can I show you my cookies?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.430
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. Please do. Let me zoom in, it looks
good.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.430
&gt;&gt; Thanks. It's very colorful.
&gt;&gt; Are you going to bite its head off?

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.620
Here's a sampling of some of the cookies we
ended up with at the end of the night. I tried

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.000
to make a Rachel's English cookie but I ran
out of room.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.210
I'm going to close with a hymn that some friends
and I sang a few nights ago. It's the first

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.060
verse of The First Noel. I'm standing in the
middle of the back row.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.520
Then I'll switch to some footage of Christmas
cheer in New York. I think New York does December

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.870
very well. A lot of restaurants and shops
put out really lovely decorations, and it

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.870
does help to get me in the Christmas spirit.
Happy holidays everyone. 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:11.500
The First Noel, the angels did say,
was to certain poor shepherds

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:26.470
in fields as they lay. In fields where they
lay keeping their sheep on a cold winter's

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:50.470
night that was so deep. Noel, noel noel, noel,
born is the King of Israel.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.640
To all my users, no matter what holiday you
celebrate if you celebrate at all, I wish

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:01.500
you a very joyous December and all the best
in the New Year.
