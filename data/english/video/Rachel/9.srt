You guys love Ben Franklin videos.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.900
They're one of the best ways for you to improve
listening comprehension and learn tricks to

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.560
sound more natural when speaking English,
like using specific reductions.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.900
This January, you're getting five all new
Ben Franklin videos where we do a full analysis

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.080
of real American English conversations.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.440
Today's topic: interview with my friend Chris.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.520
Let's get started with this analysis.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.460
First, the whole conversation.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.860
- Yeah we have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.260
Yeah. Big ones.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.840
Big dogs.  Okay, Daisy and let me see if I can remember.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.980
Oh, I can't.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.940
- Banjo.
- Banjo! That's right.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.440
And they made the move with you guys from Texas.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.620
Mmm hmm.  They did.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.500
How long have you guys had them?

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.040
Daisy, about five years.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.960
Banjo, four.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.480
Now, the analysis.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.920
- Yeah we have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.700
Yeah.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.660
Yeah we have two dogs.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.100
Yeah we have two dogs.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.830
What are the most stressed words you hear
there?

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.050
I hear 'two' and 'dogs' as being the two content
words here, the most stressed words, longer.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.080
Yeah also. Yeah.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.630
'We have', these are both said really quickly.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.500
And we have two- and we have two- we have two-

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.140
And actually the word 'have' reduces.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020
He drops the H sound.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.720
It's common to do this in function words that
begin with an H like: have, had, his, her, him.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.220
We have- we have- So the EE vowel goes right into the AH vowel, smoothly connected:

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.700
we have- we have- we have- we have-

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.620
This allows him to say these two words more quickly and we want to do that

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.640
because we want contrast with the longer words.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.520
So we want our less important function words
to be said really really as quickly as possible.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.080
We have- we have- we have two dogs-

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.400
we have two- we have two-

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.660
- We have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.320
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.120
I respond. I'm pretty sure I knew that.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.040
It's like just a way of saying I'm listening
to what you're saying.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.240
- We have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.020
Yeah.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.820
Yeah. You'll hear this word in conversation a lot.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.220
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.840
It's a stressed word.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.300
It will generally have an up-down shape of
stress and be a little bit longer. Yeah.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.420
Yeah.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.940
Rather than: yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.480
Which is how it would be pronounced if it
was unstressed. Yeah.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.620
Big ones.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.780
- We have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.380
Yeah.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.620
- We have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.160
Yeah.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.320
- We have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.960
Yeah. Big ones.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.020
Big ones.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.940
Big ones.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.780
So these are both stressed words. Big ones.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.600
They're both longer than a function word like we have up here. Big ones.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.520
'Big' is more stressed than 'ones'.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.220
The pitch is a little bit higher.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.300
Big ones.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.380
The pitch for 'ones' falls away from the stressed
'big', from the peak of 'big'.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.460
Big ones.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.700
Big ones.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.180
Big ones.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.660
Big ones.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.340
Big ones.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.640
Big dogs.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.320
Big dogs.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.460
So again, two stressed words and I'm sort
of stretching them out even more.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.660
Big dogs.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.640
I'm doing this for emphasis.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.100
Big dogs.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.660
Big dogs.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.720
- Big dogs. Okay.
- Mmm hmm.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.040
He says mm-hmm.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.980
And you can see his mouth doesn't open at all.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.480
This is an affirmation, a way of saying yes or yeah.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.920
We say it a lot in conversation.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.340
Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.500
- Okay.
- Mmm hmm.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.820
- Okay.
- Mmm hmm.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.920
Okay Daisy and--

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.320
Okay Daisy and--

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.340
So in this thought group, 'dai' is definitely the most stressed.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.520
It's a proper noun and it's the name of the
dog so the stressed syllable of this word

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.500
will be very clear: Daisy.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.520
Okay, Daisy-

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.820
Okay, Daisy-

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.220
Okay, Daisy-

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.940
Okay, Daisy and-

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.820
And- So this is unusual, this is a function word.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.360
We usually reduce it which means we drop or
change some of the sounds.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:23.350
I say the whole word clearly. The AH as in
bat vowel transitioning into the N consonant

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.820
and the D sound.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.860
We almost always drop the D but I'm thinking here, I can't remember the name of his other dog.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.640
And....

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.650
So by drawing out the word like that,
I'm taking more time showing that I'm uncertain

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.060
trying to remember that dog's name.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.000
And-- and-- and let me see if I can remember.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.400
Let me see if I can remember.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.500
Let me see if I can remember.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.460
See and the stressed syllable of remember
are the most stressed words there.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.960
The rest are said very quickly.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.800
And we do have some reductions: 'let me' becomes
lemme.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.030
We drop the T completely.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.740
You might have seen people write it this way
before: lemme.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.900
I don't recommend writing reductions but we
use them in spoken English all the time.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.260
Let me see- Let me see-

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.220
let me see if-- let me see if-- let me see if I can remember--

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.180
If I can-- If I can-- If I can remember.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.540
So 'if I can' and actually  even the first syllable of 'remember' because it's unstressed.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.240
If I can re-- are all said really quickly,
lower in pitch, a little flatter in pitch:

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.650
If I can re-- all of them linked together
smoothly.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.940
If i can re-- If i can re--

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.050
Notice the word 'can'. I'm not pronouncing
it fully pronounced which would have the AH vowel

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.860
but I'm reducing it: can- can- can- K schwa
N. Can- can- can-

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.060
This is because 'can' is a helping verb here.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.260
That means it's not the main verb.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.620
'Remember' is the main verb.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.060
'Remem--' and it does have stress

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.680
but 'can' when it's not the main word,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.640
which is most of the time, when it's not the main verb, is reduced.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.620
So instead of 'can' it becomes: can, can, can, said very quickly.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.780
Practice that with me now.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.220
Can- can- if I can- if I can- if I can- if I can- if I can remember.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.720
if I can- if I can- if I can remember.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.140
So there's a big difference between the unstressed
words: if I can- and the stressed word 'remember'

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.140
which has that clear up-down shape, full pronunciation,
long stressed syllable.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.500
If I can remember.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.140
If I can remember. If I can remember. If I can remember.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.340
Oh...I can't.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.200
I say: Oh, I can't.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.750
I can't.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.740
I can't.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.820
A stop here at the end where we stop the air: can't-- nt-- nt-- nt--

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.760
An abrupt stop. The air stops in my nose because N is a nasal constant.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.440
I can't-- I can't--

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.880
I can't--

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.620
I can't--

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.640
- I can't-- 
- Ba- Banjo.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.100
And I say this at the same
time that he is taking me out of my misery

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.530
and giving me the right answer: Ban- Banjo.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.980
Banjo.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.360
Again, it's a proper noun so it's going to
be stressed.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.240
The first syllable is the stressed syllable: Ban-- jo.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.120
Banjo.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.440
Banjo.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.820
Banjo.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.400
Banjo.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.940
Banjo. That's right.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.480
Banjo. That's right.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.760
So I'm being dramatic here spending more time
on the name.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.430
Of course, I remember as soon as he said it.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.160
I've seen Banjo on Instagram many times.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Banjo.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.720
Banjo.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.140
Banjo.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.520
Banjo. That's right.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.060
That's right. That's right. That's right.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.000
These two words a little bit mumbled.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.440
Not as clear I definitely drop the TH in 'that's'.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.800
at's right.  at's right. at's right.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.580
That's pretty common.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:24.070
In fact, I could have even dropped the vowel and just put the TS sound in front of the  R consonant.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.800
T's right. T's right.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.680
We do that quite a bit with that, it's, let's,
and what's.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.420
Reducing those words to just the TS sound.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.520
But here I don't do that. I keep the AH vowel but I do drop the beginning consonant. That's right.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.840
That's right.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.980
This is pretty normal.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.520
You'll hear this quite a bit in normal conversation,
casual conversation.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.360
That's right. That's right.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.360
That's right. And they made the move with you guys.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.500
And they made the move with you guys.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:59.220
So notice I definitely dropped the D here and that is a more normal pronunciation of the word 'and'.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.380
And they made the move.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.850
I keep the full AH vowel.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.800
Could have reduced it to the schwa:

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.400
And they made the move--

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.720
And they made the move--

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.120
And they made the move--

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.600
And they made the move with you guys from Texas.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.740
And they made the move with your guys--

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.100
A little stressed there.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:25.140
From Texas-- So the stressed words more
clear, more time, up-down shape of stress.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.620
The unstressed words flatter in pitch, said
more quickly, less important.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:36.560
And they made the move with you guys from Texas.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.320
The word 'from' reduced.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.200
It's not: from but: from- from- from Texas-

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.920
So the vowel changes to the schwa.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.140
So we can see that word really quickly: from- from Texas-

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.740
- From Texas.
- Mmm hmm they...

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.180
- From Texas.
- Mmm hmm they...

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.060
- From Texas.
- Mmm hmm they did.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.500
Mmm hmm. Again, an affirmation.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.980
Like saying: Yes, they did.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.270
They did.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.540
'Did' more stressef than 'they'.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.160
They did.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.220
- From Texas.
- Mmm hmm. They did.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.980
- From Texas.
- Mmm hmm. They did.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.460
- From Texas.
- Mmm hmm. They did.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.080
- From Texas.
- Mmm hmm. They did.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.240
How long have you guys had them?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.760
How long have you guys had them?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.300
That is definitely the longest word in the
sentence, the most stressed.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.720
The other words a little less clear.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.140
In fact, I reduced the word 'have' by dropping the H consonant.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.560
How long have you guys-

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.820
Have-- have-- have--

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.660
I also changed the vowel from AH to the
schwa.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.100
So it's just schwa V. Long have- long have-
long have-

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.140
And whenever we do reductions, we want to make sure that we link them in.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.440
So this is just linked right on to the next
word, to the word before, and the next word:

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.200
how long have- long have- Practice that with me now.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:01.420
Long have- long have- long have you- long
have you- How long have you guys had them?

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.060
How long have you--  How long have you--
 How long have you guys had them?

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.770
'Had' also has a little bit of stress.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:13.400
Had them- had them- 'Them' is another word
that often reduces by dropping the TH.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.180
I did not do that here.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.780
How long have you guys had them?

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:21.760
Even though I didn't do it, it's still not stressed.  It's lower in pitch.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.680
The intonation doesn't have the up-down shape
of stress, that curve in the voice.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.220
How long have you guys had them?

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.680
Them? Them? Them?

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.340
Had them? Had them? Had them?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.320
Daisy, about five years. Banjo, four.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.660
Daisy, about five years.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:48.860
Dai-, five, and Banjo, about four.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:55.300
So again, our two proper nouns Daisy and Banjo stressed.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.980
Here, we're talking about, we've already established that that's who were talking about.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.880
And now we're asking about something different.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.560
We're asking about how long Chris has had
these dogs.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.459
So I think the word 'five' is even more stressed
than Daisy.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.560
Daisy, about five years.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.520
Because this is the new information.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.160
This is the information I'm asking about.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.300
Daisy, about five years.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.360
Daisy, about five years.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.620
Daisy, about five years.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.780
Five years.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.320
Five years.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.540
'About' with a stop T because the next word
begins with a consonant.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.020
About five years.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.500
About five years.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.860
About five years.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.480
About five years.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.220
Five years.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.320
The intonation for the word 'years' is a little
high and he holds it out a little bit.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.700
That says to me that it's an estimate.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.460
It's like not exactly five years.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.760
Five years.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.920
Five years.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.080
Five years.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.680
Five years.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.440
And he's also thinking: How, how would I say that? Is that true?

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.340
Maybe he's also thinking about Banjo.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.320
He's about to tell me Banjos age.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.020
Maybe he's not quite sure how long they've
had Banjo.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.140
Five years. Banjo, four.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.300
Four.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.560
Four.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.120
So we have a bit of this quality...

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.240
which is called popcorn we have a bit of a popcorn sound in the voice.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.580
And that's pretty normal for final words in
a thought group.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:26.000
The general trend of phrases in American English is that they go down in pitch

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.900
and they lose energy towards the end.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:34.420
That's why it's very common for there to be
that popcorn quality at the end of a sentence.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.040
Four.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.780
Four.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.040
Instead of: four, four.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.420
Four.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.840
Four.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.720
Four.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.420
If you notice this, pay attention to this.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.080
You don't want to have this popcorn quality
in your voice all the time.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.240
But if you do bring it in at the ends of phrases,
it can definitely help you sound more natural

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.920
when speaking English.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.200
Let's listen to the whole conversation one
more time.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.580
- Yeah we have two dogs. 
- Yeah.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.960
Yeah.  Big ones.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.100
Big dogs.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.520
Okay, Daisy and let me see if I can remember.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.220
- Oh, I can't. 
- Ban-banjo.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.990
Banjo! That's right. And they made the move with you guys from Texas.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.360
Mmm hmm. They did.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.220
How long have you guys had them?

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.140
Daisy, about five years. Banjo, four.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.240
That analysis is really fun and helpful, right?
