00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.439
You asked for it. So in this American English
pronunciation video, we’re going to do a

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:13.080
Ben Franklin exercise where we take real American
English conversation and analyze the American

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.480
accent to improve listening comprehension
and pronunciation skills.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.220
First, let’s listen to the whole conversation.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.480
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom.
HQ: Hi.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.710
T: Hi.
HQ: Nice to meet you.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.440
T: How are you?
T: Nice to meet you, too.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.400
R: Have you guys met before?
HQ: Um…

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.280
T: I don’t think so.
HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.100
me about him.
R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.269
known both of you for so long, but …
T: Yeah.

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.670
R: Never overlapped.
T: Yeah, well, it’s about time!

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.629
Now for the analysis.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.120
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.479
Did you notice how the second syllable of
‘HaQuyen’ and the syllable ‘Tom’ were

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:06.049
the most stressed? They had that up-down shape.
Especially ‘Tom’, which came down in pitch

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.630
at the end of the sentence.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.780
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.859
We want this shape in our stressed syllables.
The two words ‘this is’ were flatter and

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.079
quicker.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.040
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. [2x]
HQ: Hi.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.860
T: Hi:

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:35.100
Both words, ‘hi’, ‘hi’, ‘hi’,
had that up-down shape. Hi. Hi.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.040
HQ: Hi.
T: Hi. [3x]

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.280
HQ: Nice to meet you.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.920
These two phrases happened at the same time.
HaQuyen said, “Nice to meet you.” What’s

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.340
the most stressed word there?
HQ: Nice to meet you. [2x]

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.220
‘Meet’. ‘Nice’ also had some stress,
a little longer. Nice to meet you. The word

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.440
‘to’ was reduced. Rather than the OO vowel,
we have the schwa. Nice to, to, to.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.840
HQ: Nice to meet you. [2x]

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.480
Nice to meet you. What did you notice about
the pronunciation of this T?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.440
HQ: Nice to meet you. [2x]

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.300
It was a Stop T. Meet you. There was no release
of the T sound.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.520
HQ: Nice to meet you. [2x]

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.690
Tom’s phrase, “How are you?” How are
you?

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.130
T: How are you? [2x]

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.730
He stressed the word ‘are’. How are you?

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.920
T: How are you? [2x]

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.170
You’ll also hear this with the word ‘you’
stressed. How are you?

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.480
T: How are you? Nice to meet you, too.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.580
Tom really stressed the word ‘too’.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.310
T: Nice to meet you, too. [2x]

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.110
It was the loudest and clearest of the sentence.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.440
T: Nice to meet you, too. [2x]

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.610
He, like HaQuyen, also reduced the word ‘to’
to the schwa. To, nice to, nice to meet you.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.330
T: Nice to meet you, too. [2x]

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.210
Also, again like HaQuyen, he made a Stop T
here. He did not release the T sound.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.520
Meet you.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.980
T: Nice to meet you, too. [2x]
R: Have you guys met before?

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.070
I put a little break here, between ‘guys’
and ‘met’, while I thought about what

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.280
I was going to say.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.490
R: Have you guys met before?

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.730
Did you notice my pronunciation of T?
A Stop T.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.890
R: Met before?

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.770
We tend to make T’s Stop T’s when the
next word begins with a consonant. Or, when

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.630
the word is at the end of a thought or sentence.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.490
R: Met before? [2x]
R: Have you guys met before?

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.050
What do you notice about the intonation of
the sentence? How does it end?

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.030
R: Have you guys met before?

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.100
Before? It goes up in pitch.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.290
R: Have you guys met before?

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.210
That’s because this is a yes/no question.
A question that can be answered with yes or

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.300
no goes up in pitch at the end. Other questions,
and statements, go down in pitch.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.280
T: I don’t think so.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.160
I don’t think so, I don’t think so. Again,
there was a clear stop in sound here. I don’t

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.180
think so.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.300
T: I don’t thinks so. [2x]

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.060
I don’t think so. The words were not connected.
I don’t, I don’t, I don’t think. I don’t

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.160
think so. ‘Think’ was the most stressed
word there. I don’t think so. Feel your

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.540
energy to towards it and then away from it
in the sentence. I don’t think so.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.240
T: I don’t think so.
HQ: No, not, not in person.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:54.370
The first ‘not’ was a Stop T, as HaQuyen
did not continue. Not, not. Not in person.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.250
The second T, though, was a Flap T because
it links two vowels together. The AH vowel,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:09.790
and the IH as in SIT vowel. Most Americans
will make the T between vowels a Flap T, which

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.900
sounds like a D between vowels. Not in [3x].
Not in person.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.139
HQ: Not in person. [2x]

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.270
‘Person’ is a two-syllable word. Which
syllable is stressed?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.360
HQ: Not in person [2x].

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:33.110
The first syllable. PER-son. The second syllable
doesn’t really have a vowel in it. It’s

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.220
the schwa sound. But when the schwa is followed
by N, you don’t need to try to make a separate

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.620
vowel, -son, -son, person, person.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.960
HQ: Not in person [2x], but you’ve told
me about him.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.100
How is the T pronounced in ‘but’?

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.370
HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [2x]

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.800
It’s a Stop T, but you’ve, but you’ve.
What’s the most stressed, the most clear

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.060
word in this phrase?

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.500
HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [2x]

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:11.700
It’s the verb ‘told’. But you’ve told me about
him. The sentence peaks with that word.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.160
HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [2x]

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.240
HaQuyen dropped the H in ‘him’. We do
this often with the words ‘him’, ‘he’,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.639
‘his’, ‘her’, for example. Also, ‘have’
and ‘had’.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.200
HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [2x]

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:36.410
Now the T comes between two vowels. What’s
that going to be? A Flap T. About him, about

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.260
him. Just flap the tongue on the roof of the
mouth.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.419
HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [2x]
R: Okay.

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:49.590
I didn’t really pronounce the OH diphthong
here, it was more like a schwa, okay, okay.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.250
‘-Kay’ had the shape of a stressed syllable.
Okay.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.650
R: Okay. [2x] It seems like you have…

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.570
In the first part of this sentence, what is
the most clear, the most stressed syllable?

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.220
R: It seems like you have [2x]

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:11.580
It’s the word ‘seems’. It seems like
you have [2x].

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.139
R: It seems like you have [2x] because I’ve
known both of you for so long, but.

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.690
What about in the second half of the sentence.
What’s the most stressed syllable?

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.670
R: because I’ve known both of you for so
long, but. [2x]

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:34.760
Known. Because I’ve known both of you for
so long. ‘Long’ is also stressed, it’s

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.990
also a longer word.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.830
R: because I’ve known both of you for so
long, but. [2x]

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:50.430
Even though this sentence is very fast, it
still has longer stressed words, ‘seems’,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:57.820
‘known’, ‘long’. It’s important
to keep your stressed words longer, even when

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.130
you’re speaking quickly. This is what’s
clear to Americans.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:07.700
R: because I’ve known both of you for so
long, but. [2x]

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:14.300
The less important words, the function words,
will be less clear and very fast. And sometimes,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:20.610
we’ll change the sounds. For example, in
the word ‘for’. That was pronounced with

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.790
the schwa, for, for, for. It’s very fast.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.660
R: For so long [2x], but.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.870
How did I pronounce the T in ‘but’?

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.110
R: For so long, but. [2x]

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:41.360
It was the end of my thought, it was a Stop
T. But, but. I stopped the air.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.340
R: For so long, but. [2x]
T: Yeah.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:54.280
Tom’s interjection, ‘yeah’: stressed.
Up-down shape. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.380
T: Yeah. [2x]
R: Never overlapped.

00:08:56.389 --> 00:09:01.449
Can you tell which is the stressed syllable
in ‘never’? Which is longer?

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:03.230
R: Never overlapped. [2x]

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:10.389
It’s the first syllable. Ne-ver. What about
in the next word?

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:12.180
R: Never overlapped. [2x]

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:23.480
Again, it’s the first syllable. O-verlapped.
Never overlapped. Uh-uh. Never overlapped.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.800
R: Never overlapped. [2x]

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.689
Notice the –ed ending here is pronounced
as a T, an unvoiced sound. That’s because

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:41.540
the sound before, P, was also unvoiced. Overlapped,
overlapped.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.559
R: Never overlapped. [2x]
T: Yeah, well, it’s about time.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:51.879
Did you notice that Tom didn’t really make
a vowel here. Tsabout, tsabout. He connected

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:55.089
the TS sound into the next sound.

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:58.350
T: Well, it’s about time. [2x]

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.800
How is this T pronounced?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.639
T: Well, it’s about time. [2x]

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:07.939
A Stop T, because the next sound is a consonant.

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:10.159
T:  Well, it's about time.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.820
Let’s listen again, following along with
our marked up text. You’ll hear two different

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:21.209
speeds, regular pace, and slowed down.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.520
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom.
HQ: Hi.  T:  Hi.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.920
HQ: Nice to meet you.
T:  How are you?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.600
T: Nice to meet you, too.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.699
R: Have you guys met before?
HQ: Um…

00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:43.449
T: I don’t think so.
HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:49.220
me about him.
R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.300
known both of you for so long, but …
T: Yeah.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.800
R: Never overlapped.
T: Yeah, well, it’s about time!

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.200
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom.
HQ: Hi.  T:  Hi.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.280
HQ: Nice to meet you.
T: How are you?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.000
T: Nice to meet you, too.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.660
R: Have you guys met before?
HQ: Um…

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.619
T: I don’t think so.
HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told

00:11:11.619 --> 00:11:14.449
me about him.
R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve

00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:16.619
known both of you for so long, but …
T: Yeah.

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:19.219
R: Never overlapped.
T: Yeah, well, it’s about time!

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:27.980
We’ll listen one last time. This time, you’ll
repeat. You’ll hear each sentence or sentence

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:36.449
fragment three times. Repeat exactly as you
hear it, paying attention to intonation, sounds,

00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:38.429
and stress.

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:45.970
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. [3x]

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:52.410
HQ: Hi.
T: Hi. [3x]

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.390
HQ: Nice to meet you.
T: How are you? [3x]

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:03.270
T: Nice to meet you, too. [3x]

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:12.020
R: Have you guys met before? [3x]

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:20.580
HQ: Um…
T: I don’t think so. [3x]

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.360
HQ: No, not, not in person. [3x]

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:32.780
But you’ve told me about him. [3x]

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.100
R: Okay. [3x]

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:44.579
It seems like you have [3x]

00:12:44.579 --> 00:12:50.699
because I’ve known both of you [3x]

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:57.300
for so long, but … [3x]

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.820
T: Yeah. [3x]

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:07.600
R: Never overlapped. [3x]

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:14.839
T: Yeah, well, it’s about time! [3x]

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:17.709
Now the conversation, one more time.

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:21.340
R: HaQuyen, this is Tom.
HQ: Hi.  T:  Hi.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.040
HQ: Nice to meet you.
T: How are you?

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.019
T: Nice to meet you, too.

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:24.790
R: Have you guys met before?
HQ: Um…

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.800
T: I don’t think so.
HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.619
me about him.
R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve

00:13:30.619 --> 00:13:32.790
known both of you for so long, but …
T: Yeah.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.410
R: Never overlapped.
T: Yeah, well, it’s about time!
