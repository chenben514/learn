00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.040
Has this even happened to you? You study a&nbsp;
language but then you go into the real world with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.160
native speakers and you can’t hardly understand&nbsp;
anything? That’s what happened to me in Germany&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.200
and the Dominican Republic all the time. It was&nbsp;
so disappointing. And if you’re studying English,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.480
I’ve got the exercise for you to stop this from&nbsp;
happening. If you’re listening comprehension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.760
is already pretty good, you’ll also get tips&nbsp;
on sounding even more natural when you speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.760
and you might even pick up some slang.&nbsp;
We’re going to improve your listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.235
comprehension and your spoken English by going&nbsp;
into the real world here to get a haircut.  

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.040
You’re going to hear a short conversation.&nbsp;
My sister-in-law is going to cut my hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.440
Then we’ll do an in-depth analysis of what&nbsp;
we hear which will improve your listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.250
comprehension and also help give you an idea&nbsp;
of how to sound natural when you speak English.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.040
This is an excerpt from an online course in&nbsp;
my school, Rachel’s English Academy and I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.723
going to show you how you can build on what you&nbsp;
learn here to build your own American voice.  

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.090
First, let’s hear the conversation. 
 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.050
Too tight? 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.550
Uhmmm 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.240
A little? 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.840
No. Leave it for now. We’ll see. 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.340
'kay.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.148
If it feels too tight later, I’ll let you know. 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.520
So, do you have a vision?

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.520
Mm-hmm.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.480
What is it?

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.001
I want to take with your&nbsp;
permission, I’d like to go to here.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.000
What do you think David? I don’t&nbsp;
know. That might be too much. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.920
You should try it. It’ll always grow.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.560
I know, but in the meantime, what if I hate it?

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
Well, it won’t be too short. I think it’ll&nbsp;
be good because it’s going to have layers

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.560
and movement.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.240
Can you do one inch longer than that?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.960
Okay, fine.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.680
Okay, thank you.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.477
Darn it.

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:48.560
Darn it (laugh). I just don’t have the balls.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.400
Well, but you could grow a set.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.800
I know, I could, but I’m too busy feeding a&nbsp;
baby and building a business and all that.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
Yep. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.163
And now the analysis  

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:00.134
Too tight? 

00:02:00.134 --> 00:02:05.938
Too tight? Tight? Pitch going up at&nbsp;
the end. She was asking me a question.

00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:08.560
Too tight?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.075
Too tight? Notice she had a clear&nbsp;
stop T at the end of the word tight.

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:17.040
Tight?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.692
Tight. So, that sounds different than the&nbsp;
word tie, which has the same sounds only no T.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440
Tight. Tie. Tight.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.080
Tight?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.320
The word tight is a lot more abrupt&nbsp;
because of this stop than tie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.000
which has more of a curve in the voice. Too tight?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.689
Too tight?

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:41.560
Umm...

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.234
A little? 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.480
Then she said “a little?” as in a&nbsp;
little too tight? A little? Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.800
her voice went up in pitch at the end. 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.300
Umm...

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.200
A little?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.920
A little? Little is a really&nbsp;
tough word. The double T&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.360
is a flap, so it sounds like the American D. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.520
It might sound like the R in your&nbsp;
language. Little. Little. Little. 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.840
A little?  

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.200
It also has a dark L, and when I say this word,&nbsp;
I don’t move the front top of my tongue 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.253
away from the roof of the mouth&nbsp;
between the flap and the L. Little. 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.400
I go from using the front&nbsp;
of the tongue to the back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.947
but I don’t actually move&nbsp;
the front of the tongue. 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200
A little? A little?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.711
A little?  

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.600
No. Leave it for now. We'll see.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.100
'kay.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.040
No. Leave it for now. Leave it for now. A couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.000
things to note. How did I&nbsp;
pronounce the word for? 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.434
For now.  

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.960
With the schwa. So, the schwa&nbsp;
is absorbed by the R sound. 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.868
For. For. Leave it for. Leave it for now. 

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.360
Leave it for now.  

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.800
Also, a stop T in it. Less time to pronounce&nbsp;
it. No release. It for. It for. It for. 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.778
Leave it for now. 

00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:10.217
Leave it for now. Leave it. Leave it. 

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:14.000
One way that can help you connect these two words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.484
is to maybe think of the V sound&nbsp;
as beginning the word it. 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.680
Vit. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it for now. 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.580
Leave it.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.810
Leave it for now. We'll see. 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.280
We'll see. We'll see. We'll see.&nbsp;
How did I pronounce we will? 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.568
We'll see. 

00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:36.679
The contraction. We'll. We'll. We'll. 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.356
I made a schwa sound here, and then&nbsp;
the dark L was the dominant sound. 

00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:52.301
We'll. We'll, uhl,uhluhl. Where the back of&nbsp;
the tongue pulls back. We'll. We'll see. 

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:54.480
We'll see. 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.186
I don’t lift the tip of my tongue&nbsp;
to finish the dark L. We'll, ul. 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.315
I can leave it down. I'm just using the&nbsp;
back of my tongue to make the dark L.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.355
We'll see. We'll see. 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.640
We'll see.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.463
'kay.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.484
My sister-in-law said a really quick, 'kay. 'kay, 'kay. 

00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:17.742
'kay.

00:05:17.742 --> 00:05:20.788
This is short for the word okay.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.920
You’ll hear it shortened to K a lot. K. K. K. 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.668
'kay.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.480
Now let me show you what makes exercises&nbsp;
like these special in the academy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.920
You not only have the analysis but you have a&nbsp;
soundboard where you can play with listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.840
and repeating. As you do this you can really&nbsp;
improve your skills in linking, reductions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.132
perfecting vowels and developing&nbsp;
a feel of American English.  

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.640
Each conversation is broken down into&nbsp;
little phrases and you can listen to them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.035
over and over doing the play it, say it method&nbsp;
which will really help you sound more natural.  

00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:00.000
Do you have a vision?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.115
You can listen at a regular pace.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.437
Do you have a vision?

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.280
And slow motion, this helps you figure out what&nbsp;
exactly is being said, what exactly you hear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.280
which is so important for the flow of&nbsp;
conversation. So let’s just try this now. I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.076
going to play this three times. After each time,&nbsp;
you repeat it back just like you hear it.  

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:29.433
Do you have a vision?  

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.880
I've found when my students work like&nbsp;
this with the play it, say it method&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.794
that they’re able to make corrections to&nbsp;
themselves without me even saying anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.440
Their ears and their mouth,
their body just starts working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.840
together to make corrections in a way&nbsp;
that makes them sound so natural. 

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:52.148
Leave it for now.  

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.699
So if this is something that&nbsp;
looks interesting to you,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.160
I’d like to go to here.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.227
As a training tool then head&nbsp;
over to RachelsEnglishAcademy.com

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.826
What if I hate it?

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.227
Oh, I don’t think you’re going to hate it?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.280
Repeating like this builds those pathways in&nbsp;
your brain, builds your understanding of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.284
American sound and builds your American voice.&nbsp;
Now let’s jump back to that analysis.   

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.964
If it feels too tight later, I'll let you know.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.923
If it feels too tight later, I'll let you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:33.200
If it feels. The word feels was longer. It had&nbsp;
that up-down swell. If it feels. If it feels. 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.373
If it feels---

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.685
The word if was really short. F-feels. F-feels. 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.261
There was almost no vowel, just a very&nbsp;
quick ---ih, but if I had just said f-feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.570
and just made the F sound attaching it to the&nbsp;
next word, she would have known what I meant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.987
Another stop T here, because the next word&nbsp;
begins with a consonant. F-feels. F-feels. 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.217
If it feels--

00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:01.120
too tight later--

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:09.440
Too tight later. Too tight later. So,&nbsp;
unlike the word T-O, which can often reduce,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.480
the word T-O-O never reduces. 

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.601
It will have the -ooh as in boo&nbsp;
vowel. If it feels too tight later. 

00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:20.320
If it feels too tight later-- 

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:28.292
What do you notice about tight? Again, a stop T.&nbsp;
The next sound is a consonant. Too tight later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.040
Later. Later. How did I pronounce that T? 

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.670
Too tight 

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.960
later. 

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.601
That T was again flap T. Later. Later. Later. 

00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:42.444
Later

00:08:42.444 --> 00:08:43.760
I'll let you know.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.840
I'll let you know. The word 'I'll'&nbsp;reduced. So it sounds like the word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.267
'all'. I'll let you know. I'll let you know. 

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.600
I'll let you know.  

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.880
I think you're probably noticing the strong&nbsp;
-ch sound instead of a T. Let you. Let you. 

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.794
I'll let you know.

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:05.440
Let you know.  

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.520
This often happens in American English when the&nbsp;
T sound is followed by the word you or your. 

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.840
Let you know.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:22.484
What else about the word you? The -ooh vowel&nbsp;
was reduced to the schwa. Let you. Let you. 

00:09:22.484 --> 00:09:25.120
I'll let you know.  

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.680
I'll let you know. This is a pretty&nbsp;
common phrase. I'll let you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.360
Practice that a couple times. 

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.901
I'll let you know. 

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.400
I'll let you know. I'll let you know. 

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.099
So, do you have a vision?

00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:39.201
Mm-hmm.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.475
So. I kind of drew that word out a little bit.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.901
So,

00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:51.508
So.This is a diphthong. The&nbsp;
OH as in No diphthong. 

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.520
OH. So, make sure that your&nbsp;
lips do move they will round&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.355
more. So. For the second half of the diphthong. 
 

00:10:00.355 --> 00:10:02.080
So,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.840
Do you have a vision? 

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.484
Do you have a vision? Do you have a vision? 

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.880
The -ooh vowel in do was very fast. It&nbsp;
could even be interpreted as a schwa. 

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.280
Do you have? Do you have? Do you have? 

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.240
Do you have?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.101
a vision? 

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.080
Also, the word 'you' is very fast. 
 

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.000
Do you have a vision? 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.520
And it could have been the schwa, but I think I&nbsp;
actually am hearing a real -ooh vowel there

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.160
although it's fast. Do you have a vision? 

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.320
Do you have a vision? 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:38.052
Have a. Have a. Here we have an ending&nbsp;
consonant linking into a beginning vowel. 
 

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.840
Remember, we're talking about&nbsp;
sounds when we deal with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.080
these rules of linking and&nbsp;
other things, not letters. 

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.160
So, even though the letter E is here, it's&nbsp;
silent. The final sound is the V sound. 
 

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.560
Have a. Have a. Have a. So,&nbsp;
we can link that really nicely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.628
into the article -ah. Have a vision? 

00:11:00.628 --> 00:11:03.280
Do you have a vision? 

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:10.640
Vision. Here the letter S makes&nbsp;
the -zh sound. Vision. Vision. 

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.643
Vision? 

00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:12.797
Do you have a vision? 

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.640
Do you have a vision?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.760
And my voice is going up in pitch at the&nbsp;
end. I'm asking her a yes-no question. 

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.800
Do you have a vision? 

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.400
Do you have a vision? 

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.909
Mm-hmm. 

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:30.584
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. This is a common&nbsp;
response. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:32.160
Mm-hmm.  

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.040
Do you have a response like&nbsp;
that in your language? 

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.163
That’s sort of just a grunt that doesn't&nbsp;
even involve opening your mouth? Mm-hmm. 

00:11:40.163 --> 00:11:42.243
Mm-hmm.  

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.400
Mm-hmm. That's a common&nbsp;
one in American English. 

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400
Mm-hmm.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.360
What is it? 

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.000
I want to take with your permission. 

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.388
What is it? What is it? How did we say that&nbsp;
so quickly and link things together? 

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:03.907
First of all, the T here comes between two vowel&nbsp;
sounds. So, I linked those words with a flap T. 

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.000
What is it? What is it? 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.468
What is it?  

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.960
And also, the letter S makes&nbsp;
the Z sound in this word,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.320
and the Z did connect into that next word. 

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.480
Zit. Zit. What is it? 

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.935
What is it?  

00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:26.036
What is it? So, we linked all&nbsp;
three of these words together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.698
by an ending consonant to beginning vowel link. 

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.734
What is it? What is it? 

00:12:33.734 --> 00:12:36.134
What is it?  

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:42.400
Try that with me and follow the same stress&nbsp;
pattern where 'is' is the most stressed. 

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.801
What is it?  

00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:47.501
What is it? What is it? 

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:48.312
What is it?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.867
I want to take, with your permission. 

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.400
I want to take.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.819
I want to take. So, you can probably notice&nbsp;
that she is saying wanna, not want to. 

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:00.653
I want to--

00:13:00.653 --> 00:13:01.734
I want to take. 

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.320
So, she's combining these&nbsp;
words, dropping the T sound. 

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.801
Want to. Want to. With the schwa at the&nbsp;
end. I want to take. I want to take. 

00:13:12.801 --> 00:13:15.736
I want to take

00:13:15.736 --> 00:13:17.680
with your permission. 

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.840
With your permission. She's&nbsp;
hesitating here a little bit. 

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.800
With your permission. With your permission.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.200
Because she knows she needs my permission&nbsp;
to do this. Your permission. 

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.440
How does she pronounce the word 'your'? 

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.200
Your

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.920
permission. 

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.734
It's reduced. Schwa R. Your. Your. 

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.481
Your--

00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:40.320
permission.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.459
Your permission. 

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.516
With your permission, I'd like to go to here.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.130
What do you think, David? 

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.400
I'd like to go to here. Okay, a&nbsp;
couple interesting things here. 

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.600
I'd like to go to here.  

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.404
So, she's saying I would like. I'd. 

00:13:56.701 --> 00:14:01.680
She won't do this if I don’t give her&nbsp;
permission, but this is what she wants to do. 

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.760
I'd like-- 

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.668
So, she's using the contraction&nbsp;
I would to I'd. I'd. 

00:14:07.668 --> 00:14:09.120
I'd like--

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.080
to go to here. 

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:18.519
I'd like to go to here. Okay. The word to. It&nbsp;
appears twice. Both times, she uses the schwa. 

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.760
The first time it's a clear&nbsp;
true T. Like to. I'd like to. 

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.679
I'd like to.  

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:31.859
T-T-T. But the second time you barely&nbsp;
hear it. I'd like to go to here. 

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.600
I'd like to go to here. 

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.080
It's a light flap. So, she made a true T here 

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.000
because the sound before was unvoiced,&nbsp;
an unvoiced consonant K. K. 

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.701
I'd like to go to here. 

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:53.440
And because this sound is unvoiced, she's going&nbsp;
ahead and making the T sound unvoiced as well. 

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.960
Like to. Like to. 

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.800
I'd like to. 

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:04.052
So, it's a K sound. She's stopping the air&nbsp;
and she's not releasing the K. Like to. 
 

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.000
She's going straight from the stop of air&nbsp;
into the true T sound. Like to. Like to. 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.680
I'd like to. Like to. Like to. 

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.098
So, you might not even hear the&nbsp;
K. I'd like to. I'd like to. 

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.386
But the back of her tongue is moving up&nbsp;
to the soft palette to make the K. 

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:26.720
A native speaker will hear that as a K sound&nbsp;
even though the K isn't released before the T. 

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.480
I'd like to go to here. 

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.000
I'd like to go to here.

00:15:30.742 --> 00:15:32.000
What do you think, David? 

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.234
What do you think, David? Okay, that was&nbsp;
really unclear. Very mumbly. What do you think?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:40.800
What do you think? 

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:48.960
What do you think? With a flap T here,&nbsp;
dropping the D sound and just making a flap 
 

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.701
to connect these two words, but my flap was pretty&nbsp;
sloppy. What do you. What do you. What do you. 
 

00:15:54.701 --> 00:15:57.360
What do you think?  

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.800
Not a clear flap against the roof of the&nbsp;
mouth at all. The word 'you' was reduced. 

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.578
Instead of the -ooh vowel, I used&nbsp;
the schwa. What do you think? 

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.000
That is a very common&nbsp;
phrase. What do you think? 

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.320
What do you think?  

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.200
What do you think? This is how you ask&nbsp;
somebody’s opinion. What do you think? 

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.520
What do you think, David?&nbsp;

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.935
What do you think, David? 

00:16:20.935 --> 00:16:23.280
I don't know. That might be too much.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.560
You should try it. 

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.440
Okay. Then I got really mumbly&nbsp;
before that might be too much. 

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.840
Listen to just that little bit again while I&nbsp;
tried to figure out what I wanted to say. 

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.334
I don't know. That might be too much.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.236
I don’t know. That might be too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:49.360
Very unclear. A native speaker would definitely&nbsp;
understand aow as I don't know. I don't know. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.440
don't know. That might be too much. But&nbsp;
I basically didn't make a D sound. 

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.416
I don't know. I don't know. 

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:57.863
I don't know. 

00:16:57.863 --> 00:16:58.960
That might be too much. 

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.680
I don't know. I don't know. Would be a&nbsp;
much clearer way to pronounce that. 

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.600
I was mumbling. I didn't want&nbsp;
to do what she wanted to do. 

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.134
I felt bad about it. I was trying to&nbsp;
figure out what to say about it. 

00:17:12.134 --> 00:17:14.067
I don't know. 

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:18.720
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.&nbsp;
A very unclear way to say I don't know, 
 

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.258
but Americans will certainly&nbsp;
do that. I don't know. 
 

00:17:22.258 --> 00:17:24.899
I don't know. That might be too much. 
 

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.680
And I'm continuing my mumble&nbsp;
here. That might be too much.  

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.000
That might be too much. That might be too much. 

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.480
I'm really only saying an -ah&nbsp;
or an -uh kind of vowel here. 

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.645
That might 

00:17:37.645 --> 00:17:38.640
be too much. 

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.200
I'm not really saying the -th, and I&nbsp;
am not even really making a T sound. 

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.868
That might be too much. Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh.&nbsp;
That might be too much. 

00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:47.920
That might--

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.960
be too much. 

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.890
That might be too much. I am making a&nbsp;
stop T at the end of might. Might be. 

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.640
That might be too much. That might be too much. 

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.960
That might be too much. That might be too much.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.320
You should try it. 

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.963
You should try it. You should try it. 

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.466
Okay, what about the word should? She's&nbsp;
not really making the final D sound. 

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.601
Now, the L in the word should is always silent. 

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.485
You should

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:14.400
try it. 

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.680
It's not part of the sounds, but&nbsp;
the D usually is or sometimes is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.240
but we often drop that in conversation, 
 

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:28.163
especially when the next sound is&nbsp;
a consonant. You shuh-shuh-shuh. 

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:32.000
Uh. So, just the -uh vowel. You shuh. You shuh. 
 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.760
You should.  

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.734
Try that. You shuh. You&nbsp;
shuh. You should try it. 

00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:39.221
You should--

00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:40.000
try it. 

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.121
You should try it. You should try it. 

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:46.000
You should try it. 

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.188
Now, so often, people make a -tr sound&nbsp;
and make it a -chr sound. Try. 

00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:00.080
But my sister-in-law actually didn't do that. She&nbsp;
made a pretty clear tr sound. Try it. Try it. 

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.529
Try it. 

00:19:01.529 --> 00:19:02.400
You should try it. 

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:11.639
You should try it. Try it. Vowel to vowel&nbsp;
link here, and then a stop T. Try it. 

00:19:11.639 --> 00:19:13.784
Try it.  

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.480
So, she made everything there really smooth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:24.880
really connected. You should&nbsp;
try it. You should try it. 

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.200
You should try it. You should try it. 

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.225
You should try it.

00:19:29.225 --> 00:19:30.160
It’ll always grow. 

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:36.000
It’ll. It’ll. This is just like the word&nbsp;
little that we discussed earlier. 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.434
It’ll--

00:19:37.434 --> 00:19:46.003
It will. And it's a flap that comes between the&nbsp;
-ih vowel and the schwa L or the dark L here, 

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.000
but you don’t need to bring your&nbsp;
tongue back down after the flap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
You can just put it up to the roof of&nbsp;
the mouth for the flap and then move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.720
the back of your tongue for the dark&nbsp;
L. It’ll. It’ll. It’ll always grow. 

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.760
It’ll--

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.720
always grow. 

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.252
Always grow. Always grow. 

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:10.888
Notice she doesn't really make an L sound there.&nbsp;
It's more just a clear al, al. Always. 

00:20:10.888 --> 00:20:12.640
Always--

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.720
Always instead of always. 

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:23.680
So, that's a shortcut you can use for that&nbsp;
word. Always. Always. It’ll always grow. 
 

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.711
Always--

00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:25.840
It’ll always grow.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.334
I know, but, 

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:36.612
I know, but. I know, but. Really stressing&nbsp;
the word know, there. I know, but. 

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.501
I know, but. 

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.680
Stop T at the end of but. An abrupt end there. 

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.701
I know, but in the meantime, what if I hate it? 

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.280
In the meantime. In the meantime.&nbsp;
This is a pretty common phrase. 

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.240
Mean is very stressed there compared&nbsp;
to the other words. In the. In the. 

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.201
In the meantime--

00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:06.868
In the meantime. In the meantime.&nbsp;
This means until then. 

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.787
In the meantime. 

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:16.404
Shortcut with a phrase like ‘in the’. You&nbsp;
have an N and the voiced -th sound. 

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.680
In the meantime. 

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:24.000
You can make the N with the top part of the&nbsp;
tongue touching the roof of the mouth, 

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.840
even with the tip of the tongue&nbsp;
out. So the tip of the tongue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.040
can already be making the -th shape 

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.120
with the tip through the&nbsp;
teeth. Nn the. In the.  

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.480
You can make the N with the part&nbsp;
of the tongue that's further back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.520
while the tip of your tongue 

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.440
prepares for the next sound. 

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.134
This will help you make that more&nbsp;
quickly. In the. In the meantime. 

00:21:48.134 --> 00:21:50.634
In the meantime,

00:21:50.634 --> 00:21:51.834
what if I hate it? 

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.720
What if I hate it? What if I hate&nbsp;
it? How did I say that so quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.324
and link those words together? 

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.880
What if I hate it? 

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.800
Well, there's only one word that was really&nbsp;
stressed there, that was really long,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.320
and that was the word 'hate'. 

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.600
What if I hate it? 

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.120
What if I hate it? The rest of&nbsp;
the words were very fast. 

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.170
And we linked together the words&nbsp;
what and if with the flap T. 

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.923
What if. What if. What if I. 
 

00:22:17.923 --> 00:22:19.840
What if I--

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:27.201
What if I. The F linked right into&nbsp;
the I diphthong. What if I. 

00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:28.454
What if I--

00:22:28.454 --> 00:22:30.000
What if I hate it?  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.205
What if I hate it? What if I hate&nbsp;
it? And again, we had a flap T&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.205 --> 00:22:40.160
linking hate and it. Hate it. Hate it. Hate it. 

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.160
Hate it?

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.160
And a stop T at the end of&nbsp;
it. What if I hate it? 

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.040
What if I hate it?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.480
I think you're probably starting to notice&nbsp;
that we very rarely make true Ts. 

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.400
Okay, maybe very rarely is an&nbsp;
exaggeration, but more often than not, 

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.680
a T is either a stop T or a flap T. 

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.720
What if I hate it?

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.724
Well, it won't be too short. 

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.640
I think it’ll be good because it's&nbsp;
going to have layers and movement. 

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:17.346
Well, it won't be too short. It won't be.&nbsp;
It won't be. What about those Ts again? 

00:23:17.346 --> 00:23:18.080
Well,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.160
it won't be--

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.600
She is making her sentence more smooth.&nbsp;
She's linking words together more easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.120
by making those stops. 

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.320
Well, it won't be. It won't be too short. 

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.919
It won't be--

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:32.930
too short. 

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.161
Again, too with the OO vowel not&nbsp;
reduced. We don’t reduce that word. 

00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:41.267
Too short.  

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.803
She's stressing the word&nbsp;
too. It won't be too short.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.160
It's the main word, the main&nbsp;
stressed word of that sentence. 

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.080
Well, it won't be too short. 

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.619
It won't be too short. 

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.760
All of the words before are leading up to it,&nbsp;
and the word after it is falling away from it. 

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.267
It won't be too short. 

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.240
So, she's saying, it might be&nbsp;
short, but it won't too short. 

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.973
It won't be too short. I think it’ll be good. 

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.880
I think it’ll be good. Again, the ‘it  

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.360
will’ contraction, it’ll.&nbsp;
It’ll. With that flap it’ll. 

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.742
It’ll be good.

00:24:20.742 --> 00:24:22.000
I think it’ll be good. 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.760
I think it’ll be good. Think and good. Longer&nbsp;
than I. It’ll be. I think it’ll be good. 

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.845
I think it’ll be good--

00:24:33.845 --> 00:24:35.200
cuz it's going to have layers. 

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.052
Cuz it's going to have.&nbsp;
cuz it's, it's. cuz it's.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.160
So, she changed the word&nbsp;
because to just cuz. Cuz. 

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.600
Cuz it's,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.320
Cuz it's, cuz it's, cuz it's. And she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.692
linked the Z into the next&nbsp;
word, the vowel, it's. 

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.068
Cuz it's, cuz it's, cuz it's. Because it is. Cuz it's.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.760
That's how Americans will pronounce those three&nbsp;
words very often. Cuz it's, cuz it's.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.200
Cuz it's--

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.701
going to have layers and. 

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:13.680
Going to have layers and. You probably&nbsp;
noticed 'going to' was pronounced 'gonna'. 

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.720
It's going to have. It's going to have. 

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.600
It's going to have

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.701
layers and. 

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.680
Going to have layers and. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.400
which word there is the most clear,&nbsp;
the longest, the most stressed? 

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.701
Going to have layers and--- 

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.899
Going to have layers and. Definitely&nbsp;
the word layers. Layers and. 

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.834
Layers and---

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:45.076
The next word, and, was reduced to&nbsp;
just the N sound. Layers and. 

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.960
Layers and--

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.280
And the Z sound connected into the&nbsp;
word and. S pronounced as a Z here. 
 

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.080
It's going to have layers and movement.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.680
Can you do one inch longer than that? 

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:04.623
Movement. Movement. Here she does&nbsp;
make a nice true T. Movement. 

00:26:04.623 --> 00:26:07.680
Movement.  

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.000
Can you do one inch longer than that? 

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.835
Can you do one inch longer than that?&nbsp;
I'm really stressing the word one. 

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.235
Can you do one inch longer than that? 

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.866
I don’t really agree with her, so this is&nbsp;
what I'm asking for as the compromise. 

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.204
Can you do one inch longer than that?&nbsp;

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.760
What did you notice about the word can? 

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.357
Can you? 

00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:36.629
That was reduced. Can. This is&nbsp;
usually how we pronounce this word. 

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.480
When it's a helping verb and&nbsp;
it's usually a helping verb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:46.160
that means it's not the main verb in&nbsp;
the sentence. The main verb is do. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.960
I'm going to reduce can. Can. Can. Can you&nbsp;
do one inch longer? One inch longer? 

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.670
Can you do 

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.918
one inch longer

00:26:55.918 --> 00:26:57.111
than that? 

00:26:57.111 --> 00:26:59.680
Longer than that. Longer than that. 

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.730
Longer than that? 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.205
What about the word than? Reduced. It had&nbsp;
the schwa. Longer than. Longer than. 

00:27:09.434 --> 00:27:11.040
Longer than--

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.540
that?  

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.515
Longer than that. And again, a stop T&nbsp;
at the end of that. Longer than that. 

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.560
Longer than that? 

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.200
Okay, fine. 

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.307
Okay, thank you.

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.600
Darn it. 

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.266
Okay, fine. She's kind of saying it quietly. She&nbsp;
really didn't want to agree with me at all. 

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.760
Okay, fine. Okay, fine. 

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.222
Okay, fine.  

00:27:34.674 --> 00:27:41.680
Okay, fine. Pitch falling off.&nbsp;
She's a little disappointed. 

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.658
Okay, fine.

00:27:43.658 --> 00:27:44.996
Okay, thank you. 

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:51.600
And I said, okay, thank you. I reduced&nbsp;
the word okay to just K. K, thank you. 

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.680
Okay, thank you. 

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.320
I'm also speaking quietly here. It was like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.240
painful for us to come up with&nbsp;
something we agreed on here. 

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:06.560
We both kind of gave up more than we wanted.&nbsp;
So, we both kind of mumbled our agreement. 

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.280
Okay, fine.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.307
Okay, thank you. 

00:28:08.565 --> 00:28:10.000
Darn it. 

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.600
Darn it. Darn it is like,&nbsp;
oh man, I'm disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.760
That's not how I wanted that to go. 

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.840
Darn it. 

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.960
Darn it. She makes a stop T at the end of it. 

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.178
That's because it's at the end of a&nbsp;
thought, the end of a sentence. 

00:28:24.178 --> 00:28:25.288
Darn it.

00:28:25.288 --> 00:28:27.280
Darn it. (laughing) 

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.763
I repeat what she says. Darn it.&nbsp;
Even though I'm not disappointed. 

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.840
I just don’t have the balls.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.699
Well, but you could grow a set. 

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:42.723
I just don’t have the balls. Okay, a couple of&nbsp;
things. The word just. So often, we drop the T. 

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.634
We do this when the next word begins with&nbsp;
a consonant. I just don’t. I just don’t. 

00:28:48.634 --> 00:28:50.701
I just don’t--- 

00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:55.360
I just don’t. This helps up connect the word. 

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.601
We drop the T when it comes between two&nbsp;
consonants all the time. I just don’t have. 

00:29:01.601 --> 00:29:03.834
I just don’t have-- 

00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:08.142
Don’t have. Don’t have. Don’t.&nbsp;
Very quick stop here. 

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.378
So, it's not a dropped T, but it's sort of a weak&nbsp;
stop. I just don’t have. I just don’t have. 

00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:16.480
I just don’t have--

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.303
the balls. 

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.760
I just don’t have the balls. I'm&nbsp;
stressing the words don’t and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.600
balls, and notice that the S is a Z there. 

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.640
I just don’t have the balls.&nbsp;

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.693
Well, but you could grow a set. 

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:39.280
Well, but you could grow a set. But you&nbsp;
could. But you could. Again, ending T. 

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.240
The word you becomes a -ch. But you. But you. 

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.600
But you--

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.720
could grow a set. 

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.360
And did you notice the L is silent in 'could'? 

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.360
But you could

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.435
grow a set. 

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.000
Grow a set. With a stop T. 

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.534
Grow a set.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.720
If you're unsure what these idioms mean, check&nbsp;
out the lesson that goes with this video, 

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.453
Vocab, Idioms, and Phrasal Verbs. 

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.480
I just don’t have the balls.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.320
Well, but you could grow a set. 

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.419
I know, I could, but I'm too&nbsp;
busy feeding a baby and-- 

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.668
I know, I could. 

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.187
I know, I could. 

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.796
So, these two mini phrases&nbsp;
have that up-down shape. 

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:35.203
I know, I could. Again, the&nbsp;
L in could is silent. 

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.447
I know, I could--

00:30:38.447 --> 00:30:40.160
but I'm too busy. 

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:47.301
But I'm too busy. But I'm. But I'm.&nbsp;
Connecting those two words with a flap T.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.360
But I'm. But I'm. 

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.880
But I'm--

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.832
too busy. 

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.040
Too busy. Again, the word too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:02.560
not reduced. It's got the pure -ooh&nbsp;
vowel. Too. Too. But I'm too busy. 

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.601
But I'm too busy. 

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:11.440
Did you notice the word busy has a letter&nbsp;
S, but the S is pronounced as a Z? Busy. 
 

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.628
Busy.  

00:31:13.628 --> 00:31:16.036
Busy. Also, the letter U&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:22.111
represents the -ih sound here. That&nbsp;
doesn't happen too often. Busy. Busy. 

00:31:22.111 --> 00:31:24.278
Busy--

00:31:24.278 --> 00:31:25.875
feeding a baby and--

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:34.307
Feeding a baby and. Feeding a baby and.&nbsp;
Stressing the stressed syllable of feed. 

00:31:34.782 --> 00:31:42.437
Feeding a baby. They both&nbsp;
have first syllable stress. 

00:31:42.926 --> 00:31:50.499
Feeding a baby, all connected with&nbsp;
the schwa for the word 'a'. 

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.273
Feeding a baby and--

00:31:55.273 --> 00:32:03.440
Feeding a baby and. Baby and. The word and&nbsp;
was reduced to just the schwa N sound. 

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.787
So, it just kind of sounds like an N sound&nbsp;
at the end of the word before. Baby and. 

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.647
Baby and--

00:32:10.647 --> 00:32:12.480
Feeding a baby and.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.160
Feeding a baby and.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.466
I'm too busy feeding a baby and&nbsp;
building a business and all that. 

00:32:18.466 --> 00:32:19.600
Yep.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.240
Building a business and all that.&nbsp;
So, just like feeding a baby. 

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.534
Feeding a baby,

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:33.010
Building has stress on the first&nbsp;
syllable. Building a business. 

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.501
Building a business. 

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.720
Business also has stress on the first syllable. 

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:45.920
So, again, these two words were linked together&nbsp;
with the article a, pronounced shwa -uh. 

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.000
Building a business. Business. 

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.155
Just like in the word busy, the letter S here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.600
makes the Z sound and the&nbsp;
letter U makes the -ih vowel. 

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.800
Biz. Busy. Business. 

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.897
Business

00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:03.532
Building&nbsp;a business and all that. 

00:33:03.532 --> 00:33:04.080
Yep.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:11.120
Business and. Again, reduce the word&nbsp;
'and' to just the schwa N sounds, 

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:19.760
which just sounds like an N. And all&nbsp;
that. And all that. All that. Stop T. 

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.868
And all that.
Yep. 

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.120
She agrees with me. She doesn't like it,&nbsp;
but she agrees. Yep. Yep. Very abrupt. 
 

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.000
And all that.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.520
Yep. 

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.363
Stop P, not releasing it. Yep. Yep. 

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.787
This is my sister-in-law, who cuts&nbsp;
everyone’s hair in the family. 

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.520
She has very good ideas. She's very good at it, 

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.387
but I tend to like my hair long, and she&nbsp;
wanted to go just a little shorter. 

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.920
Let's listen to the whole dialogue again. 

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.843
Too tight? 

00:33:52.843 --> 00:33:53.355
Umm… 

00:33:53.355 --> 00:33:54.000
A little?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.680
No. Leave it for now. We’ll see.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.560
'kay.
 

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.080
If it feels too tight later, I’ll let&nbsp;
you know. So, do you have a vision?

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080
Mm-hmm.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.040
What is it?

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.770
I want to take, with your&nbsp;
permission, I’d like to go to here.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.640
What do you think David? I don’t&nbsp;
know. That might be too much.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.640
You should try it. It’ll always grow.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.440
I know, but in the meantime, what if I hate it? 

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.440
Well, it won’t be too short. I think it’ll be good&nbsp;
because it’s going to have layers and movement.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.040
Can you do one inch longer than that?

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.680
Okay, fine.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.400
Okay, thank you.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.000
Darn it.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.600
I just don’t have the balls.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.440
Well, but you could grow a set.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.803
I know, I could, but I’m too busy feeding a&nbsp;
baby and building a business and all that.

00:34:34.803 --> 00:34:35.641
Yep. 

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.139
By the way she did end up cutting&nbsp;
it too short. I didn’t like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.107
But after it grew out after a few&nbsp;
months I really love that haircut. 

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:51.040
