00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.029
In this American English pronunciation video,
you're going to come to a work day at this

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:14.330
beautiful farm. We'll also study pronunciation
of the letter T, using 'kinda', and the reduction

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.330
of the words 'because' and 'to'.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.310
In this video, we're going to take a look
at some stop T endings. When a word ends in

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.120
a T that's not a part of a consonant cluster,
that T will often be a stop. For example,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.520
the word 'out' will often be 'out', 'out'.
But when that word is followed by another

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.079
word that begins with a vowel, it will often
be a flap T because now it comes between two

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.770
vowels when linked together. So, for example,
in the phrase 'out of'. That T will go from

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.170
being a stop in the word 'out' to being a
flap in the phrase 'out of'. These are general

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.630
guidelines. You will hear people clearly pronounce
the full true T at the end of the word 'out'

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.280
sometimes. It all depends on the habit of
the speaker, and how clearly the speaker is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.170
enunciating.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.939
&gt;&gt; What is the assignment today?
What is. Flap T. Listen again.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.369
&gt;&gt; What is the assignment today? [3x]

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.229
&gt;&gt; Well, you can pull up some landscape fabric,
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.009
&gt;&gt; Or take this, break this down.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.520
&gt;&gt; Or carry some wood over to the trees.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.909
&gt;&gt; Or help take this structure down.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Great.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.979
&gt;&gt; Or snip some herbs.
&gt;&gt; Snip some herbs. That sounds like the most

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.170
fun out of everything that you just said.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.880
Did you notice how I dropped the T sound in
the phrase 'just said'. Sometimes, we'll drop

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.369
the T when it comes between two other consonant
sounds. For example, the word 'exact'. We

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.290
will say and ending true T there. But when
we add -ly, it's not uncommon to drop the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.380
T: exactly, exactly, just said. Listen again.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.810
&gt;&gt; Everything that you just said. [3x]

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.090
&gt;&gt; Hi Michelle.
&gt;&gt; Hi Rachel.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.530
&gt;&gt; What project are you working on there?
&gt;&gt; I'm tearing this down. I'm destroying it.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.140
&gt;&gt; You're doing a good job.
&gt;&gt; Thanks. Kinda fun. You should join in.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.069
&gt;&gt; I should help, instead of videotape, right?
&gt;&gt; It's ok. We're doing a pretty good job.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.760
Did you notice how Michelle said 'kinda'.
She reduced the word 'of' to just the schwa

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.089
vowel and attached it to the word 'kind'.
Kinda, kinda. Listen again.

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.540
&gt;&gt; Kinda fun. [3x] You should join in.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.909
For the record, I didn't only make a video.
I did also help.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.109
&gt;&gt; It's stuck!
&gt;&gt; Michelle, let me help you with that.

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.109
&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks Rachel.

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.310
&gt;&gt; It's a good thing I've been 
working out lately.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.330
Working out. Stop T. Working out lately. Listen
again.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.330
&gt;&gt; Working out lately. [3x]

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.650
&gt;&gt; Edgar is documenting me documenting.
&gt;&gt; Documenting you documenting me.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.249
&gt;&gt; It's a meta-documentary going on there.
&gt;&gt; Notice how HaQuyen leaves off the T in

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.409
'documentary'.
&gt;&gt; Do you know why you're doing that?

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.530
&gt;&gt; Why am I doing it? Am I reducing it?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's, T is a weird letter, and sometimes

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.070
after N we do drop it. Like, in words like
'center', we'll say 'cenner'. Interview ...

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.840
&gt;&gt; 'Innerview'.
&gt;&gt; 'Innerview'. Documentary.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.500
&gt;&gt; 'Documennary'.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.619
&gt;&gt; Rachel, why'd you take off your hat and
jacket?

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.299
&gt;&gt; Because I got hot.

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:16.299
Did you notice how I reduced the word 'because'
to 'cuz', 'cuz'. Because I got hot. Listen again.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.000
&gt;&gt; Because I got hot. [3x]

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Also, did you notice that stop T: hot, hot.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.800
&gt;&gt; Because I got hot. [3x] Do you remember

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.000
that awesome video I made on 'hot' back in
the summer?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.430
&gt;&gt; Uh, no, I don't.
&gt;&gt; You actually don't need to respond. I'm

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.440
going to put a link to it then.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.470
&gt;&gt; How can I help, Rachel?
&gt;&gt; Well, we're about to need to take all the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.610
plants that have grown on this out.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.070
Did you notice how I said 'about to'. And
I reduced the word 'to' to the true T and

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.030
the schwa sound. The reason why I didn't make
it a flap T is because the word before ended

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.170
in a T. So in this case, when we reduce the
word 'to', we need to keep the true T. About

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.850
to. About to. Listen again.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:23.610
&gt;&gt; We're about to need to take [3x] all of
the plants that have grown on this out.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.600
&gt;&gt; Edgar, how much time did we save you by
coming to the work day?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.240
&gt;&gt; You saved at least a month.
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow! That's great.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.240
Great. There I released the T, making the
ending T a true T sound. Listen again.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.670
&gt;&gt; That's great. [3x] What are you going to
do with that extra month?

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.650
&gt;&gt; Think I'll work some more!
&gt;&gt; Get other stuff done.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.900
&gt;&gt; Get other stuff done.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having us out.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.300
Out. There I made the ending T a stop T. Listen
again.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.060
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having us out. [3x]
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. You guys were great.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.710
&gt;&gt; Our pleasure.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.710
&gt;&gt; Ready? Okay.
&gt;&gt; That's it, and thanks so much

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.110
for using Rachel's English!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
&gt;&gt; He was quiet for the whole take, I can
hardly believe it. Thank you.
