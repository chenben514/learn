00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.279
As some of you know, last week my beloved
bike Jenny was stolen from the front of my

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.039
apartment building here in New York City.
You may remember Jenny because she has been

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.219
in a video before.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.219
&gt;&gt; This is my bicycle, Jenny. I didn't name
her, she came named.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.752
So, I had to replace Jenny and 
I bought this Schwinn.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.780
It's called a "World Traveler", 
and that's not a very

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.340
good name for a bike. So I asked all my fans
on Facebook to suggest different names, and

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.820
today I'm going to choose my favorite name
out of those suggestions to name this.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.350
I got lots of really great suggestions, and
I loved doing this, so I may start doing it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.440
when I have children, too. So start thinking
of names. But, some of my favorites. Priscilla

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.450
and many other suggested the name Magrela,
and this was the reason why. It's like a nickname

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.940
to bike in Portuguese, meaning 'little thin'
or 'skinny'. Look at all the people that suggested

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.869
that name! My friend Egle was very persistent
about the name Joan. Sorry Egle, it is a pretty

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.359
name, but I didn't choose it for my bike.
Ari suggested the name Floyd, which happens

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.869
to be the name of one of my favorite professors
from college, but I don't think I'm going

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.020
to name my bike Floyd. Monica suggested
Alberta, and I really love the reason

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.359
why she suggested it. "Life is like riding
a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:38.229
keep moving." And Erick suggested Frida Khalo
after the painter. I did really consider that

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.950
one. It was in the front running, but I didn't
choose it. There were also a lot of name suggestions

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.950
that had repeating syllables. For example,
Boo Boo, Ti Ti, Lulu, Cece, Cocoa, Jon-Jon,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.549
and Juju. Now, I happen to love all of those,
but ultimately, didn't choose any of those

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.069
either. But, it's a great teaching moment,
so let's take a minute to talk about these

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.979
repeating syllables.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.280
First of all, cocoa. I find this very interesting
because it's the same sounds, but it's spelled

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.360
differently. In the first syllable, it's just
the letter O, and in the second syllable it's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.980
OA. I admit this really confused me as a kid.
Any word that is two syllables has one stressed

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.470
and one unstressed syllable. So, even though
all of these words have the same sounds in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.390
both syllables, they'll actually not quite
sound the same, because a stressed syllable

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.380
won't sound the same as an unstressed syllable.
So, for example, cocoa. I'm going to take

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.250
an audio look of that first syllable and then
an audio loop of the second syllable, and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250
you can hear how different they sound.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.560
I hope you hear that the second syllable is
quieter, is lower in pitch, and sounds a little

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.430
bit like I've taken some of the energy and
a little bit of the voice out of it. Cocoa,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.880
-coa, -coa. So this is the difference between
a stressed syllable and an unstressed syllable.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.890
So you're probably wondering: if I didn't
choose all of these great names, then what

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.930
name did I choose? Well, the name I chose
is...

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.930
Lucy! Which was suggested by Paulo. Thank
you so much for that great name suggestion.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.170
What do you guys think, does she look like
a Lucy?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.930
Do you have a bike that you love? Tell me
about it in the comments. Or better yet, post

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.990
a picture of you with your bike to my Facebook
page. Tell me a story about it. Or, practice

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.970
your English. Make a video with your bike,
telling me about its name, or how you got

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130
it, or a great trip you've taken with it.
Post it as a video response to this video

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.700
on YouTube. I can't wait to hear all your
stories.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.700
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
