00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.890
Have you ever wondered how to say the word
'chili'? In this American English pronunciation

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.199
video, you'll learn how to. I took my video
camera with me to two different Super Bowl parties.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; You're going there first?
&gt;&gt; I'm going to Mark and Hillary's first.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.610
I'm, I'm kind of going before, probably before--
&gt;&gt; I thought you were--

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.430
&gt;&gt; You thought what?
&gt;&gt; I thought you were coming after.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.210
&gt;&gt; Well, I kind of decided that I might not
even--

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.990
Here I reduced 'kind of' to 'kinda'. I admit,
I'm talking really fast here. I wasn't actually

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.060
planning on using this footage. But it is
true that sometimes people do speak that quickly.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.470
'Kind of' reduced to 'kinda'. Listen again.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:05.800
&gt;&gt; Well, I kind of decided that I might not
even-- [x3]

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.239
&gt;&gt; Well, I kind of decided that I might not
even stay through the end of the game.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.640
&gt;&gt; Oh.
&gt;&gt; I just feel like I have a lot to do tomorrow

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.020
because I have a lot to get ready for.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.350
&gt;&gt; Are you bringing anything?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I have to go to the store first.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.540
I don't know what I'm going to bring. Do you
have any suggestions?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.000
&gt;&gt; Um, no.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.950
This is my friend Hillary, and yes, she's
a little crazy.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.450
&gt;&gt; Hey, go Giants! AHHH!

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.280
&gt;&gt; This is my friend Mark, who's hosting a
Super Bowl party. Mark, who do you think's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.880
going to win tonight?
&gt;&gt; I think the Patriots are going to win.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.920
&gt;&gt; Why?
&gt;&gt; What?!?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.470
&gt;&gt; I think the Patriots are going to win because
their offense is better than the Giants' defense.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.300
And, they've got Tom Brady and Super Bowl
experience.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.320
&gt;&gt; How do you feel about saying that while
you are in the state of New York?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.239
&gt;&gt; I'm from Philadelphia. So, I don't like
the Giants to start with, and I don't like

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.109
the Patriots either. So, I can be very objective.
&gt;&gt; You just wanted a reason to throw a good party.

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.500
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; It works.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.239
&gt;&gt; Hillary, who do you think's going to win?

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.999
&gt;&gt; I'm going Giants all the way. Um, I feel
like Eli Manning really brings it, um, he

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.489
brings it to the table.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.840
Hillary used the idiom 'to bring something
to the table'. This means to provide a useful

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.329
skill. For example, I'm partnering with Tom
in my business because he's great at marketing.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:49.279
He really brings something to the table. She
used a generic bring it to the table, meaning

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:57.970
'it', that something special, in this case,
that makes one win football games. Listen again.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.229
&gt;&gt; He brings it to the table. [x3]

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.229
&gt;&gt; He brings it to the table.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:10.450
&gt;&gt; Um, I also think since we're in New York,
it's just more fun to root for the Giants.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.189
&gt;&gt; I think you're right.
&gt;&gt; So, that's my take.

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.829
&gt;&gt; And, can you tell me what you guys have
got going here? Now, I'm here early, I'm here

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.650
before all of the other guests. But I hear
that there's chili to be had.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.029
&gt;&gt; There's tons of chili, vegetarian and meat.
&gt;&gt; Can you step through how to pronounce 'chili',

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:30.849
Hillary?

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.339
Did you notice? I reduced the word 'can'.
That's because it's a helping verb here, the

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:44.339
main verb being 'step through'. Can you step
through. Kn, kn, can you step through. Listen

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:47.409
again.

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.459
&gt;&gt; Can you step through how to pronounce 'chili',
Hillary?

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.809
&gt;&gt; Uh, I would say 'chili'.
&gt;&gt; But how do you do it? What do you do to

00:03:55.809 --> 00:04:02.700
your mouth?
&gt;&gt; Well you, you go-- chuh, like, chuh-li--

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.700
&gt;&gt; Ok you know what guys? Forget her. I will
teach you how to say 'chili'.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:16.449
&gt;&gt; So, chili. It's a two syllable word, first
syllable is stressed. Chi-li. It begins with

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:25.730
the CH consonant sound, ch, ch, opening into
the 'ih' as in 'sit' vowel, chi-. Then, there's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:33.630
a dark L, so the tongue will pull back a little
bit, chil-, before finishing with the tongue

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.670
in the top position. Chil-i. Finally, the
unaccented syllable is the 'ee' as in 'she'

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.730
vowel. In both syllables, the vowel sound
is written with the I, but in the first syllable,

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.730
it represents the IH sound, and in the second
syllable, the EE sound.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.690
&gt;&gt; Chili. The first syllable tastes delicious.
The second syllable tastes delicious.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.950
&gt;&gt; Isn't it really hot?
&gt;&gt; Chili, yum.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.270
&gt;&gt; Mark, can I help you with anything?
&gt;&gt; No, I think I'm good. Thank you.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.150
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:26.280
Did you notice? Mark used the phrase 'I'm
good'. You can use this to decline an offer.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:34.190
Would you like a glass of water? I'm good.
Can I get you anything else? I'm good. Can

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.660
I help you with anything? No, I think I'm
good. Listen again.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:46.000
&gt;&gt; No, I think I'm good. Thank you. [x3]

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.890
&gt;&gt; No, I think I'm good. Thank you.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.370
Now on to the next party for more chili 
and to watch the game.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.810
&gt;&gt; Look! It's Eli Manning! I thought he was
going to be in Indianapolis at the game!

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.419
&gt;&gt; It's just me Dan.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.340
&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching my Super Bowl video.
Did you watch the Super Bowl? Leave a comment

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.180
if you did.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.060
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
