00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.130
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over how to pronounce 'unicycle'.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.349
I happened to come across this young man who
has the unique skill of being able to ride

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.119
a unicycle.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.529
Uni means 'one' or 'single'.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.720
Unique comes originally from the Latin word
'unicus' -- meaning "only, single, alone of

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.720
its kind".&nbsp; Riding a unicycle is a pretty
unique skill.&nbsp; Not many people can do it.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.070
Unicycle.&nbsp; Unlike a bicycle, bi-, which has
two wheels, or a tricycle, tri-, which has

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.530
three whiles, this has just one!

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.620
Let's listen to these two words again.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:08.280
...who has the unique skill of being able
to ride a unicycle. [3x]

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:19.509
Unique, unicycle.&nbsp; They both start with the
EW as in FEW diphthong.&nbsp; This sounds just

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:31.499
like the word 'you'. You, you.&nbsp; Unique,
unicycle.&nbsp; Then we have the N consonant.

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:40.380
The next sound depends on the word.&nbsp; In 'unique',
it's a stressed syllable, and here it's the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:54.950
EE as in SHE vowel, -ni-, -ni-, unique.&nbsp; In 'unicycle',
-ni-, -ni-, uni-, it's unstressed, and it's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.509
the IH as in SIT vowel. Uni-, unicycle.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.990
Unique, unicycle.&nbsp; In the interview I'm stressing
the first syllable of 'unique' a little too

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.730
much because I'm excited to teach the uni-
prefix.&nbsp; Unique, unique.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.380
I happened to come across this young man who
has the unique skill of being able to ride

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.140
a unicycle. How long did it take you to learn
how to ride this?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.210
&gt;&gt; Um, so far a year. It's...but, I was able
to ride pretty well about a month after I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.840
started.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, did you practice everyday?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.990
Bonus tip:&nbsp; did you, did you. Since we're
studying the EW diphthong in the word UNIQUE,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.470
let's also study it in the word YOU after
a D sound.&nbsp; You'll often hear native speakers

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.260
make a J sound when the word 'you' follows
a D.&nbsp; We mix the D and the Y sound together

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:13.710
-- Di-jew, did you, di-jew, did you? Other
common occurrences:&nbsp; could you, could you,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.400
and would you, would you.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:28.320
Did you do it?&nbsp; did you, did you
Could you help?&nbsp; could you, could you

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.040
Would you mind?&nbsp; would you, would you.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.549
Listen again.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.530
&gt;&gt; Did you practice everyday? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Pretty much, yeah.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.830
&gt;&gt; I've heard it's very, very hard.
&gt;&gt; It's hard learning, but we set up a rope

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.110
in my garage, and it was really fun. Though
it took a while, yeah, I was able to do it.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.400
&gt;&gt; And, I heard that you actually use it for
transportation now. You go to the library,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.170
and you take it to school. Is that right?
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, yes.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.790
&gt;&gt; So, do you get, like, weird looks? What's the
deal with this?

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.520
&gt;&gt; Mostly people honk at me and yell out the
window.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.500
&gt;&gt; Has it made you the most popular kid at
school?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.210
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Has it made you the least popular kid at

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.319
school?
&gt;&gt; No.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.880
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.380
We have this word part in other words too.
Like in 'united' of United States. Unity.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.470
Anything that means coming together in this
case.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.660
United.&nbsp; Here the letter I represents the
AI as in BUY diphthong.&nbsp; This is the stressed

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:42.020
syllable.&nbsp; U-ni-ted. United.
Unity.&nbsp; Here the letter I is in an unstressed

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.380
syllable, and it's the IH as in SIT vowel.&nbsp;
U-ni-ty.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.520
Uniform, University.&nbsp; Again the letter I
is in an unstressed syllable, and it's the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.910
IH as in SIT vowel.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.130
In all of these cases, it's the EW as in FEW
diphthong in that first sound. Now, every

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.320
time you see U-N-I starting a word, is it
this? Is it pronounced this way? No, unfortunately

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.860
not. Take for example the
word 'uninsured' or 'uninterested'. Here,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.650
un- is the prefix. Not --uni. And, it's pronounced
with the UH as in BUTTER vowel.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.960
Let's look at two words that are very similar:
uninformed, uniformed.&nbsp; The only difference

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.430
in spelling is this N.&nbsp; But one word breaks
down with the prefix un-, and the other with

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:45.160
the prefix uni-, so the first syllable of
these words will not be pronounced the same.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.780
Uninformed, uniformed.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.280
As you learn more vocabulary, and you learn
how to break down the words, into their parts,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.000
you'll be able
to see this kind of thing a little more easily.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.070
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.289
&gt;&gt; Oh yes! Why don't you try that. That'll
be funny.

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.289
&gt;&gt; How do you? ... Think I'll just leave it
there.
