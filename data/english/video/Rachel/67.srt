00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.100
In this American English pronunciation video,
we'll look at English in action and take a

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.559
look at the 'aa' vowel followed by nasal consonants.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.179
&gt;&gt; Hey Jovon, happy Easter.
&gt;&gt; Oh, hey, happy Easter.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.580
&gt;&gt; Hi Ben.
&gt;&gt; Hello Rachel.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.289
&gt;&gt; Happy Easter.
&gt;&gt; Happy Easter.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.949
&gt;&gt; Ben brought a ham for us to eat.
&gt;&gt; I brought a ham.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.130
&gt;&gt; Ben brings a ham every year because he's
a dear. And I don't mean deer the animal,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.070
I mean dear, D-E-A-R, a kind and thoughtful
person. 'Dear' and 'deer' are homophones.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.650
&gt;&gt; What is this, Ben?
&gt;&gt; This is a ham. And it is made with pineapple

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.340
and brown sugar.
&gt;&gt; Oh, delicious. Ham. This is a teachable moment.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.820
&gt;&gt; Here comes the ham. Now the word ham --
&gt;&gt; (it's really hot)

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.560
&gt;&gt; -- is an interesting word because it's
the AA as in BAT vowel followed by a nasal

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.360
consonant, in this case, M. So even though
it's written in IPA just with the H consonant,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.350
AA vowel, and M consonant, it's not actually
pronounced that way. That would be "haam",

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.510
"haam". But we say, ha-uh-m. And there's that
UH sound that's not accounted for in IPA:

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.140
aa-uh, aa-uh. Ham. So, if you add this UH
sound to your AA vowel, you'll sound much

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:43.530
more American. Other examples, camera. AA-UH-M.
Cam-, Camera. This is also true if the sound

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:53.860
after the AA is the N sound. For example,
'ant'. AA-UHnt. Ant. Now, one last thing.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.140
If the AA vowel is followed by the NG consonant,
then it changes also, but, in a different

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.000
way. In that case it becomes a sound more
like the 'ay' diphthong, ay. For example,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.040
in the word 'thanks': thanks. Or, bank, bank.
So pronounce your AA vowel this way when it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.029
followed by N, M, or NG.

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.680
&gt;&gt; Michelle, what are you working on here?
&gt;&gt; I'm making Eggs Benedict.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.659
&gt;&gt; Ooo.
&gt;&gt; So I'm poaching eggs --

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.669
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; And then making them with salmon and spinach.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.259
&gt;&gt; Oh, that looks delicious.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:40.290
&gt;&gt; Jovon's always taking pictures. It's a
good thing I'm used to the camera, right?

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.659
So this is what I made for our meal. Some
green---it probably doesn't look as good under

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:53.040
plastic, eh? Some asparagus. I roasted it
yesterday, gonna serve it chilled with a dijon

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.309
vinaigrette. Yum.

00:02:54.309 --> 00:03:00.409
&gt;&gt; What did you make, Kate?
&gt;&gt; I made Easter egg chocolate / peanut butter

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.930
candy.
&gt;&gt; Oo, that looks good. Now these are special,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.730
right?
&gt;&gt; They're special: they're vegan.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.889
&gt;&gt; They're vegan.
&gt;&gt; No dairy.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:13.519
&gt;&gt; Wow. Let me zoom up on that. Jovon's been
trying to sneak one of those ever since you

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.389
made them yesterday.

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:22.000
&gt;&gt; I found the little ladle. That's a hard
little phrase. Say that five times quickly!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.009
Little ladle [x5].

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:31.779
&gt;&gt; Ben, this ham is delicious.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:37.609
&gt;&gt; You guys are so clear, such good actors
for my Rachel's English audience. Totally

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.849
natural.
&gt;&gt; They're hamming it up.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:47.639
&gt;&gt; They are hamming it up. Thank you, Matthew,
for brining up another use of the word 'ham'.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:55.809
Matthew cleverly pointed out a second definition
for the word 'ham'. An actor or performer

00:03:55.809 --> 00:04:05.669
who overacts. As a verb: to act with exaggerated
expression of emotion, to overact. So the

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:13.449
idiom, to ham it up, simply means, to overact.
Example sentence: He really hammed it up for

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.319
the camera.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.139
&gt;&gt; Happy Easter, guys.
&gt;&gt; Happy Easter, Rachel.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.539
&gt;&gt; Hope you're learning lots of fun vocabulary.
&gt;&gt; They are.

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.490
&gt;&gt; We learned all about the word 'ham'.
&gt;&gt; Ham.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.520
&gt;&gt; Oo, ham.
&gt;&gt; That's a good one.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.419
&gt;&gt; It is a good one and --
&gt;&gt; It's a nasal one.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.849
&gt;&gt; -- it's sort of an odd word because it's
got this AA-UH sound.

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:35.639
&gt;&gt; haa, haaa. Like that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you had to explain how you pronounce

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.069
'ham', what would you say?
&gt;&gt; Um, haa, aa. There's an H in there.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.490
&gt;&gt; Yes?
&gt;&gt; There's an A, with an aa, kind of an aa?

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.099
&gt;&gt; Very nasal aa sound.
&gt;&gt; M, and then an M, mm, mm.

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.389
&gt;&gt; So if you had to say it in slow motion,
say it in slow motion.

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.650
&gt;&gt; Haaauhm.
&gt;&gt; There you go! I heard that good UH sound.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.909
HaQuyen?
&gt;&gt; Ham.

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:09.050
Let's watch this in slow motion. As you know,
AA followed by M has an 'uh' sound. AA-uh,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.889
AA-uh. You can see HaQuyen's tongue pull back
to make that UH sound before her lips close

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.349
for the M.

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.419
&gt;&gt; Ham.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, nice

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.849
&gt;&gt; Got that in the profile.
&gt;&gt; Yep, she gave the profile so we can see

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.690
the movement of the tongue and everything.
Thanks guys!

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.020
&gt;&gt; You're welcome Rachel.
&gt;&gt; You're most welcome.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.900
That's it, and thanks so much
