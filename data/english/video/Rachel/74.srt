00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Today, we're going on a road trip. In this
video we're going to look a little bit at the

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
American landscape, and of course we will
study some English pronunciation. So, 'road

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.880
So, 'road trip' begins with the R consonant sound.
And one of the benefits to seeing it in profile,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.880
when I must look forward because I'm driving,
is you get to see -- road -- how much the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.140
lips come away from the face when they round
to make that initial R. Road trip. So the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.290
R opens into the 'oh' as in 'no' diphthong,
ro-, which means they must come together again

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.200
for the second half of that diphthong. Ro-,
ro-. Now, the D here is a stop consonant.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.079
It's not released before going into the TR
consonant cluster. Road trip, trip. So the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.199
TR consonant cluster. You may think, that
sounds like a CHR to me. Trip, trip. And of

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.090
course there is a technical reason for that,
and I have made a video on that, based on

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.220
the position of the lips and tongue. Road
trip. So the next sound is the 'ih' as in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.080
'sit' vowel, and finally, the P consonant
sound. Road trip. On this trip, we passed

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:39.250
through several states. Including West Virginia,
Maryland, "Maryland welcomes you," and Pennsylvania.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.750
We passed lost of beautiful countryside, 
including many farms. 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.000
However, we did run into one small problem.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.299
-- So Rachel, why is the traffic
zooming by and we're stuck here on the highway?

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.939
-- Yeah. -- Because we ran out of gas. -- And
why did, wait, what happened? -- Because I

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.869
didn't pay attention. I've never run out of
gas before in my life. -- How does that make

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.530
you feel? -- Like an idiot. -- But we're going
to get out of this one. -- He's a Triple-A

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.530
member. -- Kevin's saving the day for us.
-- What? 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.530
Luckily some friends were able
to stop and give us some gas.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.569
This allowed us to get back on the road and 
enjoy one of the best things about road trips:

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.580
going to a drive through to get some good, 
old-fashioned American junk food.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.000
-- So I'm enjoying some Arby's fries. 
And I also ate a delicious Arby's roast beef.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.120
With our stomachs full, we hit the road again.
Idiom: to hit the road. To leave, to get going. 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.000
Here we are at the gas station. 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.069
There's no need to make two separate

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.730
sounds with any kind of lift in between. Gas
station, gas station. You can see there's

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.370
just one S sound. So, it starts with the G
consonant sound, gg, it goes into the 'aa'

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.769
as in 'bat' sound: ga-, gas. There's the S
sound, just once. It then goes into the T

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:45.629
sound: gas st-, gas sta-, the 'ay' as in 'say'
diphthong. Gas station. Followed by the sh

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:52.420
consonant sound, the schwa, and the N sound.
Gas station, gas station. 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.000
-- Rachel, what are you doing right now? 
-- I'm filling up.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.569
-- Filling up, what does that mean? 
-- I'm putting gas in the car.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.000
Fill 'er up. And the reason why I'm doing that is 
so I don't run out of gas when I'm on the highway.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
-- We don't want that to happen. 
-- We don't. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Fill 'er up [x4] 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:54.000
-- Alright, I need money for the toll. 
-- Almost home. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:20.000
-- Hi. -- How ya doing? -- Good, how are you? 
-- Fine. $1.60. -- $1.60. Thanks, have a good day.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.790
I wonder how he's going to feel about being
on Rachel's English. 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.880
Hey, there's a beautiful shot 
of the Empire State building.
