00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.509
A friend of mine in a rock band here in New
York recently asked me and another friend

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.459
to show up at his concert wearing a horse
mask. Needless to say, this generated quite

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:20.480
a bit of interest. And this got us all thinking
about idioms involving a horse. In this American

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.080
English pronunciation video, we'll go over
some of those idioms.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:38.559
Would you believe we came up with almost 20
phrases and idioms that use the word horse,

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.320
or somehow reference horses. And, I'm sure
there are more.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.620
&gt;&gt; Get off your high horse.
&gt;&gt; Get off your high horse. That's a perfect

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.850
one.
&gt;&gt; Stop horsing around

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.679
&gt;&gt; These are, you have so many idioms!
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm cheating.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.219
Get off your high horse. To be on a 'high
horse' is to have an attitude of arrogance,

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.100
of self-righteousness. 'Get off your high
horse' means, stop being so arrogant. You

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.720
have a couple options with the T in 'get'.
You can either make it a flap T, connecting

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.780
it to the word 'off', get off, get off. Or,
if you're really emphasizing and going to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.110
make a pause, you can make it a stop T. Get
off. Get off your high horse.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.920
Stop horsing around. Horsing around is rough
of rowdy play, usually in good fun. My mom

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.250
often accused my brother and I of horsing
around.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.530
&gt;&gt; Horse idioms. We have: don't look a gift
horse in the mouth...

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.579
&gt;&gt; ...you can lead a horse to water, but you
can't make it drink,

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.990
&gt;&gt; ...hoofing it.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.000
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. This
means, don't be ungrateful or suspicious when

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.390
someone gives you something. A friend said
this to me recently when I was talking about

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.030
an offer that I got from someone to help me
with my business. And I was a little suspicious.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.760
He said, "You know, Rachel, don't look a gift
horse in the mouth."

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.299
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't
make it drink. This basically means, you can't

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:20.030
make people do what they don't want to do.
Let's talk a little bit about the pronunciation.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.219
You can lead a horse. So the main verb here
is the word 'lead'. That means 'can' is a

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:34.510
helping verb. So we don't want to say 'can'.
We instead want to reduce that word to 'kn',

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.269
'kn'. You can lead. You can lead a horse to
water. But you can't make it drink. You might

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.590
hear a CH sound happening between 'but' and
'you', but you, but you. This can happen when

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.989
the T is followed by the Y consonant, but
you, but you. But you can't make it drink.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.579
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't
make it drink.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:07.620
Hoofing it means to be moving really fast,
to be running somewhere. For example, I hoofed

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.239
it to work because I overslept. Note that
the double-O here is pronounced as the UH

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.459
vowel, just like cook, book, and Brooklyn.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.009
&gt;&gt; Straight from the horse's mouth.
&gt;&gt; Making hay.

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.620
&gt;&gt; A charlie horse.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.849
Straight from the horse's mouth means that
you've something from the most authoritative

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:39.269
or dependable source. For example: &gt;&gt; Did
you hear Jane is quitting her job? &gt;&gt; No way.

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.010
Where did you hear that? &gt;&gt; From Jane herself.
Straight from the horse's mouth.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:53.139
Making hay, or, making hay while the sun shines.
This is to make the most of current opportunities.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:04:00.049
If you put doing something off, you may loose
the opportunity to do it. For example, let's

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.219
make hay and go for a run before it starts
raining again.

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:11.159
A charlie horse. This phrase is used for muscle
cramps in the legs. You might hear this phrase

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.899
as you watch the Olympics this summer.

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:17.319
&gt;&gt; I could eat a horse.
&gt;&gt; I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. That's true.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.660
&gt;&gt; Did we say don't beat a dead horse? Don't
beat a dead horse.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.630
I could eat a horse. Well, this means, of
course, that you're very very hungry. Notice

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.870
the T at the end of the word 'eat' links to
the next word, a, a schwa sound, so it's a

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:43.410
flap T or a light D sound. Eat a, eat a, eat
a. I could eat a horse. &gt;&gt; Rachel, are you

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.080
hungry? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I skipped lunch, so I could
eat a horse.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.290
Don't beat a dead horse. You might say this
to someone who can't let a situation go. If

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.350
you think someone needs to accept things as
they are, and they just keep talking about

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.410
'what if?', 'what if?', then you might say:
Look, don't beat a dead horse. It's done.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:15.350
&gt;&gt; Don't put the cart before the horse.
&gt;&gt; That's a horse of a different color.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.750
Don't put the cart before the horse. This
means be patient and do things the right way,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.720
in the right order. Sometimes it's very tempting
to do things out of order and skip ahead.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.780
But it doesn't always get the best results.
Someone might say to you: do it right, don't

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.300
put the cart before the horse.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.940
A horse of a different color. That is when
you bring something up that is unlike that

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.730
which you are already talking about. For example,
to me, writing and spelling are easy. But

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.240
math, that's a horse of a different color.
Meaning, to me, math is very hard.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.370
&gt;&gt; Oh, there are so many idioms with 'horse'!
&gt;&gt; Hold your horses!

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:02.280
&gt;&gt; Hold your horses!
&gt;&gt; That's a great one.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.780
Hold your horses. That means hold on, be patient,
stop what you've just started. It's among

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:16.390
the most common of these horse idioms. Notice
I'm reducing the word 'your' to 'yer', 'yer'.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.210
Hold your horses.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:24.100
&gt;&gt; This is a one-horse town. Put a horse out
to pasture.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:32.130
A one-horse town is a small, maybe insignificant
town. For example, he's very overwhelmed by

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.830
the city, he comes from a one-horse town.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.490
To put a horse out to pasture. This is when
a racing horse is retired, but it can also

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.380
be used with people, when someone is forced
to retire. For example, Larry is past retirement

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.979
age. I think it's time to put him out to pasture.

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.810
&gt;&gt; Wild horses couldn't drag him away.
&gt;&gt; Oh that's a good one. I use that sometimes.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.180
My friend used that once recently.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.750
Wild horses couldn't drag him away. This is
said when someone is very engrossed in or

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:09.150
committed to something. Nothing can persuade
him or her to leave or stop doing that thing.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:15.870
For example, &gt;&gt; Are you watching the Mad Men
Finale tonight? &gt;&gt; Yes, wild horses couldn't

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.950
drag me away.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.330
&gt;&gt; A dark horse candidate, for example.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:26.030
A dark horse is someone who is more or less
unknown who emerges to a place of prominence

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:32.030
or importance, usually in a competition. This
is used quite a bit to describe a candidate

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.150
in politics.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:39.550
After doing our idiom research, we went out
to dinner, and then made our way home. Although,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:45.180
I can't really recommend riding a bike in
the horse mask, because essentially, I could

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.920
not see a thing out of it.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.870
That's it. Thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
