You guys love Ben Franklin videos.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.900
They're one of the best ways for you to improve
listening comprehension and learn tricks to

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.660
sound more natural when speaking English,
like using specific reductions.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.900
This January, you're getting five all new
Ben Franklin videos where we do a full analysis

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.849
of real American English conversations.

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.440
Today's topic: reading headlines.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.560
Let's get started with this analysis.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.520
First, the whole conversation.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.460
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people, is, I'll be like,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.660
"oh, I read about…".

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.260
Yeah.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.640
But I didn't actually read the actual thing.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.820
The actual about.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.080
I read the headline. Or I read the one-sentence blurb that...

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.680
Yeah.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.360
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.260
Now, the analysis.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.280
In this little quip of conversation, my friend
Laura and I are talking about how we're in

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.380
this bad habit of not actually reading articles.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.999
We'll just read headlines and the one-second
summary and then we'll talk about it, "Oh,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.320
I read about…blah blah blah" even though
we didn't actually read the article.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.360
Are you guilty of that too?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.799
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.880
Okay this is a really long through group and
I'm speaking really quickly.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.260
But even though I am, I am still making some
words longer.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.140
They're being brought out with a little bit
more length but also a little bit more volume.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.540
And they'll be a little higher in pitch, they'll
have uuuhhh---- this shape.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.800
Let's try to identify what they are.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.539
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.959
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.770
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.880
I feel like-

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.619
I feel like that's a lot- Let's just start there.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.180
I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.369
'Feel' and 'lot' are a little bit longer and they have

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.220
the peak of the volume and of the pitch of the stress.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.480
Let's listen to that little sentence part,
that little sentence fragment again.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600
I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.920
I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.060
I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.040
I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.020
I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.750
So even though we speak

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.810
quickly in American English, we still have
longer syllables and that is really important

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.000
for clarity with American English.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.030
I've had some students who know that Americans
speak quickly and they want to do that too.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.230
But it feels way too rushed and the reason
why is because it doesn't have these longer

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.380
words or syllables within the faster syllables.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.640
We have to have the long ones too.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.200
I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.040
Okay let's listen to a little bit more and see

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.380
what else do we hear as being a little
bit longer, a little bit more stressed?

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.260
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.140
Conversations that I have with people-

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.570
Conversa-- So this syllable is a little bit more stressed,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.020
a little bit longer: conversations that I
have with people--

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.330
'Have' is more stressed here, a little longer.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.680
the conversations that I have with people-

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.100
the conversations that I have with people-

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.540
the conversations that I have with people
is, I'll be like "Oh, I read about…"

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.240
Conversations that I have with people is,
I'll be like "Oh, I read about…"

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.960
So those are for me the longest, most clear
syllables and a lot of the other syllables

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.490
are said really quickly.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.040
Are there any reductions?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.460
Let's go back and see.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.690
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.280
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.760
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.630
Let's look at the first sentence fragment.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.900
Um. What's happening?

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.620
So, this is not a reduction but it's a link when we're putting two words together when one word ends

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.680
with the same sound that the next word begins
with.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.459
We don't say 'feel…like' but we say 'feel like'.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.380
We connect them with a single L. I feel like-- I feel like that's a lot of the--

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.880
I feel like- I feel like- I feel like that's a lot of the-

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.800
Another thing, so we have the linked L here.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.940
Another thing I'm noticing is um, how high
the intonation is here.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:45.190
I feel like- I feel, feel- That's pretty high
and I guess I was just doing that because

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.850
it's sort of funny and so that brought more
emotion and energy into the voice which made

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.360
the pitch even higher.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.180
Okay, so everything links together.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.160
I feel like that's- K right into TH sound,
TS cluster right into the schwa: tsa-

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.700
that's a- that's a- that's a-

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.990
Then we have 'a lot of the'.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.380
Now it's unclear to me, the word 'of' would be fully pronounced this way,

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.180
I definitely reduce it to the schwa.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.500
I'm not quite sure if I dropped the V or not, it's said very quickly.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.380
You can definitely drop the V here.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.880
A lot of the- A lot of the- Then you just
use schwa to link 'lot' and 'the' and the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.200
T here will become a Flap T, just one single
flap against the roof of the mouth because

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.750
it comes between two vowels.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.740
And the little three-word phrase, 'a lot of',
is very common.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.920
So practice it that way with me right now: a lot of- a lot of- a lot of- a lot of-

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.480
really smooth,  forward flow of sound.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.020
A lot of- A lot of- A lot of the conversations
that I have with people-

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.360
The conversations that I have with people.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.620
Okay so the schwa 'of the' going right into
the C, there's no break here.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.860
The conversations that-

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.340
The word 'that', I reduce that.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.700
The vowel has the schwa.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.080
Conversations that- that I have with people-

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.700
Okay, I'm doing something a little interesting
here.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.920
Well, first, the Z sound of 'conversations'
linking into the TH.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.160
Conversations that- Conversations that- No
stop in sound.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:28.340
So usually, most people would link this but
I don't.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.400
I don't link it with a Flap T. I sort of re-emphasize.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.540
Why do I do that?

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.130
Don't know. Doesn't matter.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:41.090
Usually, we'll link things with a Flap T when
the next word begins with a vowel, we'll link

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.740
that ending word.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.000
We'll link that ending sound, rather.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.100
When a word ends in a vowel or diphthong plus
T and the next word begins with a vowel or

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.300
diphthong, just like up here with 'lot of',
we so often flap that T.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.880
Every once in a while, we don't.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.080
I'm emphasizing 'I' by putting a little break.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.030
I'm emphasizing that.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.880
I have- I have these conversations with the people--

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.520
That I have with people-

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.240
That I have with people-

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.770
That I have with people-

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.900
So even though I don't connect with a Flap
T, it's still petty smooth.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.060
There's not a big break there.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.620
That I have with people- So I have.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.580
'Have' is more stressed but 'I' is also a little bit longer:

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.340
That I have with people-

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.960
That I have with people-

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.840
have with people-  have with people-

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.660
These sounds are all connected.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.020
The V right into the W, the TH right into the
P. No break here.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.760
People-

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.020
This word can be tough for some people.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.760
Haha.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.540
'People' can be tough for people.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:51.020
Okay, so the pronunciation is P, the EE as
in She vowel in the stressed syllable, and

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.540
then the Dark L, pll- pll- pll- in the unstressed
syllable.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.990
A lot of people want to round their lips a
little bit.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.260
They substitute that in for the Dark L. Try
to make sure your lips are relaxed for this sound.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.900
People.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.560
Ull, ull, ull, ull.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.640
You want the back of the tongue to be doing
the work for this sound.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.920
people- people- people-

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.850
Is I'll be like- Is I'll be like- Is I'll
be like- Okay so this is all pretty mumbled.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.960
IS, the word 'is' has a Z sound so that links
into the next sound: Is I'll be like-

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.880
So the word 'I', the words 'I will' contract to 'I'll'

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.640
but it's hardly every pronounced that way.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.440
It's almost always reduced to something like:
all, all, all.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.400
Which sounds like 'all' said quickly.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.340
All, all.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.300
Is I'll- Is I'll- Is I'll-

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.360
Is I'll be like- Is I'll be like- Is I'll be like-

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.820
Is I'll be like- Is I'll be like- Is I'll be like-

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.240
Is I'll be like- Is I'll be like- The word
'be' said really quickly.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.380
It's almost like there isn't a vowel there.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.620
Be like- be like- be like- Is I'll be like--

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.800
So this is all lower in pitch, a little flatter, it comes across pretty unclear.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.260
So we have sets of words like this, strings
of words like this in American English that

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.960
are less clear, certainly less fully pronounced
and that provides contrast with the clearer

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.670
stressed syllables like 'I have'.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.620
And that contrast is important in American
English.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.920
Is I'll be like "Oh, I read about."

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.020
Oh, I read about.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.280
So here, I'm slowing down.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.520
I'm speaking really clearly because I'm quoting
myself.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.750
I'm not just talking.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.529
I'm saying something that I had said.

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:42.360
When we say: I'll be like- 'Like' is another
way to say 'she said' so 'I'll be like' is

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.280
'I'll say' or if you're talking about a woman,
you can say: And then she was like 'No way!'.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.620
That would be the equivalent of saying: And
then she said 'No way!'.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:01.140
So we use the word 'like' sometimes in storytelling
as a substitute for 'said'.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.480
I'll be like- I'll say or I said.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.380
'And she was like' is like saying 'and she said'.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.140
Oh, I read about.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:18.040
Okay so more clear, longer words, ending D
links into beginning schwa of 'about'.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.640
Everything is nice and connected.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.000
I do a True T here.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.220
Again, I'm speaking more clearly.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.560
I'm not just talking, I'm quoting myself so
I have to make it seem different.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.420
And that's why it's all a little bit more
clear that just normal conversation.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.450
Is I'll be like "Oh, I read about."

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.360
Is I'll be like "Oh, I read about."

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.000
Is I'll be like "Oh, I read about."

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.160
But I didn't actually read the actual thing.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:49.880
But I didn't actually read- I put a little
break here separating thought groups.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.120
But I didn't actually read the actual thing.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.839
I do that for emphasis.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.660
It's funny. I'm talking about reading something but I
didn't read it.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.300
I just read one sentence about it.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:05.980
But I didn't actually read- 'Read', much longer,
the most stressed word there.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:13.080
But I didn't actually read- But I, but I,
but I- This is like I was saying before, usually

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.680
when a word ends in a T and the sound before
is a vowel or a diphthong, and the next word

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.540
begins with a vowel or diphthong, we flap
that to make a smooth connection.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.860
But I, but I, but I-

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.520
But I, but I, but I-

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.760
But I didn't actually- Didn't actually- It
sounds to me like I'm stop, I'm dropping the T.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.900
There's no sense of a stop here: didn't actually- So ending N is linking into the  next vowel.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:45.580
na- na- didn't actually- actually-

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:46.620
I didn't actually-

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.620
I didn't actually-

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.620
I didn't actually-

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.540
Actually.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.960
Actually.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.340
So this word can be four syllables: actually.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.320
Or it can be three: actually.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.120
I think three syllables is a little bit more common.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.700
It's a little easier, that's what I have done.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.760
Ac- tually- In IPA, I would write it like this.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.700
Stress on the first syllable: Ac- tuall- and
then I'll probably write that with the schwa.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.480
Actual- ly- Actually.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.400
Actually.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.300
The ending E links right into the next sound,
the consonant R. Actually read- Actually read-

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.820
So everything is smoothly connected.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:35.420
actually read- actually read- actually read
the actual thing.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.000
The actual thing.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.160
The actual thing.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.440
So I'm stressing this quite a bit.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.080
I've slowed down: The actual thing.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.240
Those two syllables have some stress.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.300
The word 'the' pronounced with the EE vowel.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.290
We typically do that when the next word
begins with a vowel or diphthong.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.560
Otherwise, we pronounce it as the schwa: the.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.780
But here, it's 'thee'.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.580
The actual- The actual- and it links right
into the next word.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.480
The actual thing.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.980
The actual thing.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.620
The actual thing.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.360
The actual thing.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.860
And as I'm saying that, Laura says: The actual about.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.640
I can't quite tell because I'm speaking at
the same time but I think she might be doing a schwa.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.980
The actual.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.500
That's pretty normal too.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.370
I mean the rule is if the next word begins
with a vowel or diphthong, you pronounce this

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:35.080
E as the EE vowel but I've noticed Americans
certainly don't always do this.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.860
The actual about.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.480
Actual about.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.440
Linking those two words together.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:48.000
L about- l about- The actual about.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.700
And then she puts a Stop T at the end.  She does not release that.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.080
The actual about.

00:13:53.089 --> 00:13:54.640
The actual about.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.200
The actual about.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.769
I read the headline.

00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:59.300
I read the headline.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.340
Okay, what are the two most stressed syllables there?

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:08.060
I read the headline.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.700
So the words that are usually the ones that
are stressed in a sentence are the nouns,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.700
verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.420
They don't always have equal stress but those
are the words that are content words, that

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.420
are usually the ones that are these longer,
more clear words.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.839
So everything in this four-word thought group
is linked together, said very smoothly, always

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:32.200
a forward motion of the voice, not choppy at all.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.660
I read the headline.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.709
I read the headline.

00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:41.760
The word 'the' pronounced with the schwa,
the next sound is a consonant.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.240
We do pronounce the H in this word.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.839
I read the headline.

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.450
I read the headline.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.480
I read the headline.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.200
Or I read the 1-sentence blurb-

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:57.200
Or I read the 1-sentence- I put a little break
here while I'm thinking of what word to say.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.120
The word 'or'. This often reduces to 'ur'.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.020
Ur- ur- ur I read- ur I read- I don't reduce it here.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.880
Or. Or I read the- Or.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.420
So the word 'Or' is the AW as in Law sound
followed by R when it's not reduced.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.240
But the AW sound really changes here.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.510
It's not the AW, it becomes oh, oh, oh, much
more closed.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.120
The lips round further.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.240
The tongue pulls further back in the mouth.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.420
Or, or, or.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.300
Or- Or- Or I read the 1-sentence-

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.460
Or I read the 1-sentence-

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:42.900
Or I read the 1-sentence-

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.200
'Read' and 'one' get the most stress there.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.940
Everything is linked together.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.480
Let me spell out the word 'one' here.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.060
This letter is a vowel.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.380
But the word, the sounds, are these in IPA.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.460
These are the sounds.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.860
So whenever we're talking about rules like
with Flap Ts or this kind of thing or the

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:09.740
pronunciation of the word 'the', we're never talking about letters, we're always talking about sounds.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.000
So the beginning sound of this word is a consonant.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.460
That means the rule is this would be pronounced
with the schwa, not an EE vowel.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:27.180
The one- the one- not: thee one- thee one-
the, the, the, the one.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.260
The one-sentence.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.560
The one-s. The one-s. The one-sentence.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.240
One-sentence. Let's talk about this word for a second.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.580
Sentence.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.380
What's happening with that T?

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.900
Sent-ence.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:52.210
I'm making it a Stop T. The rule is when the
T is in a sequence of T, schwa, N, that it's

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.000
a Stop T. That's what I'm doing here.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.240
Sent- stop the air, really quickly just hold
it for a second, sent- ence.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.319
Sent- ence. ence. ence.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.560
Sent- ence.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.900
Other words like this: Mountain.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.480
Kitten.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.060
Fountain.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.360
Curtain.

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:19.120
I have a video where I go over this a little
bit more in detail, you can search on YouTube,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.060
Rachel's English Mountain.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.960
And it should come up.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.380
Sentence.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.200
One-sentence.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.800
One-sentence.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.280
One-sentence.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.120
One-sentence blurb that…

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:37.090
So now I say: Blurb that- and that's one thought group.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.420
I'm thinking of exactly what to say.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.860
blurb that… blurb that…

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:49.950
So I might normally reduce the word 'that'
to the schwa but I don't here because I'm

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.420
thinking about what to say so I'm speaking
a bit more slowly.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:18:01.980
Blurb that- So that keeps its full AH vowel,
it does have a Stop T. Blurb that- Blurb that-

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.740
So here we have an R, a B, a TH.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.440
Three consonants in a row.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:13.580
Blurb that- I don't release the B. B is a
stop consonant just like T.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.220
The lips come together, that stops the air.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.920
And then they release: bb-bb-

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.340
But we often don't release stop consonants
in conversation especially when the next sound

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.530
is another consonant.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:32.780
So my lips come together, I make the B sound: blurb-

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.380
But then, rather than releasing, I go right into the TH sound.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:44.240
Blurb that- Blurb that- Blurb that- Blurb
that-

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.860
Blurb that- Blurb that- Blurb that-

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.140
- That... 
- Yeah.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.500
That. Yeah. Laura says 'yeah'.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:59.020
Up down shape of stress, she knows what I'm going to say, she agrees with me, she probably does it too.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.020
Yeah.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.820
Yeah.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.340
Yeah.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.480
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.240
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:13.260
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.600
So more stress on 'face' and 'head'.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:23.440
'Posts', this is a verb and I said that nouns,
verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are the words

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.000
that are usually stressed.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.660
But not all of them will be stressed everytime.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.860
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.520
That would be too much.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.520
So even content words are sometimes not stressed
compared to the stressed words in a sentence.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.780
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.400
So here we have STS.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.280
I do make all of those sounds.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.560
Posts.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.740
Posts.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.520
Posts.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.400
Posts.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.320
Posts.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.860
Posts with the headline.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.200
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.620
With the headline.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:01.820
So I said before when we have the same sound
at the beginning and ending of a word that

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.320
links together, two words that link together
that we make one sound.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:11.960
So 'with' is usually pronounced with an unvoiced
TH, 'the' is usually pronounced with a voiced TH.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.740
When these two words come together, which
happens pretty frequently, the unvoiced sound wins.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.760
It's stronger. With the- with the- with the headline.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.160
With the headline.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.480
With the- with the- with the- with the-

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.700
So its like taking the word 'with' and just
putting a schwa at the end.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.180
with the- with the- with the headline.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.460
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.860
With the headline.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.040
With the headline.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.200
With the headline.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.020
The D sound in 'headline'.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.210
D just like T, just like B, is a stop consonant.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.740
Here, it's followed by another consonant.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:54.040
And when stop consonants are followed by consonants,
they're very often not released.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.040
So it's not headline.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.500
Head. Head. D, d, d- we don't release the tongue.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.520
Headline.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.720
We say: headline.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.080
So we put our tongue up into position for
the D, we make a quick D sound,

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.420
but rather than  releasing, we go right into the L sound.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.520
Headdddline.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.760
Headline.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.100
Headline.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.440
Headline.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.760
Headline.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.700
Headline.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.780
Headline.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.020
Let's listen to the whole conversation one
more time.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.920
I feel like that's a lot of the conversations
that I have with people, is, I'll be like,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.350
"oh, I read about…".

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.940
Yeah.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.420
But I didn't actually read the actual thing.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.480
The actual about.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.760
I read the headline. Or I read the one-sentence blurb that...

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.300
Yeah.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.540
Facebook posts with the headline.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.840
That analysis is really fun and helpful, right?

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.720
Click here to see other Ben Franklin videos
on my YouTube channel.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:56.600
But if you're ready to go even further, even
bigger, I challenge you this January, to start

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.700
the new year off right with a new commitment
to your English Studies.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.980
Join my online school Rachel's English Academy.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:09.890
There, you will find tons of Ben Franklin
speech analysis videos just like this one

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.170
that you can't get anywhere else.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:17.380
They're longer, they cover more conversation,
and I add more each month.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.160
You have to have the interest, you have to
make the time to watch the videos, to work

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.200
with the audio.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.520
Can you do this?

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.410
To help you get in the door, to help you get
started, I'm offering a discount for the month

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.789
of January.

00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:34.780
You can get the first month of the Academy
for just $5.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.920
Use the code start2018 at check out.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:44.100
The fee is normally $14 a month which is a
steal for what you get: tools and support

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.350
for self-study, to make a real difference
in how you sound.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.460
If you sign up and this method doesn't help
you, no problem.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.540
Just email me within 30 days and you'll get
a full refund.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:03.420
This is a subscription and you will be charged
every month with continuous access to everything.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.900
But you can cancel at any time.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.480
Just email me and I will make that happen
for you.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.240
So get this deal and in 2008, get the accent
you want.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.860
More fluency, more ease in American conversation.
