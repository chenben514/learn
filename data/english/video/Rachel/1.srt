00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.260
Today we’re going to study fast English.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.840
In today’s video we’re looking at a 
conversation I had with friends,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.460
where we made my husband David taste a watermelon, even though we know he hates watermelon.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.680
You’ll hear words to describe qualities of food, whether you like it or hate it, and so on.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.460
As we go, we’ll stop to talk about these terms, and also useful phrases or interesting pronunciations.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.060
This conversation is fast English.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.040
We are all native speakers speaking casually to each other, we’re all friends, this is just the pace of it.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.060
But it is very fast.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.960
Together, we’ll take a few of the sentences

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.700
and break them down to figure out how 
we’re speaking English fast,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.680
and also to figure out why it’s still easily understood by native speakers.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.540
And what you can do to speak fast English and sound natural speaking English.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.320
Uhm, David hates watermelon, he thinks.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.220
I know, but I want to try it again, you said it was the best one you've ever had.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.880
I didn't say that.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.980
So we start here by debating what I said.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.180
If someone says you said something that 
you didn’t, you can say

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.400
I didn’t say that.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.720
I didn’t say that.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.180
The N’T ending can be pronounced several ways.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.280
I think I’m doing a really quick Stop T, I didn’t say that.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.820
I say this phrase pretty quickly, don’t I?

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.060
I didn’t say that. I didn’t say that. I didn’t say that.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.580
But it wasn’t too fast.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.980
It was the pace of conversational English.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.120
Let’s listen again.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.380
The clearest longer word was ‘say’.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.420
I didn’t say that.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.360
I didn’t say that.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.560
I didn’t say that.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.080
When you listen to it on a loop,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.980
it’s easier to hear all the pieces you need 
to simplify, isn’t it?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.300
I did not is ‘I didn’t’.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.860
SAY is the peak of that sentence.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.240
--say --say

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.560
I didn’t say that. I didn’t say that. I didn’t say that.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.920
You can even completely drop the T in 
didn’t, if this helps with the simplification.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.820
You’ll hear it again five times.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340
Then you try it.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.320
Don’t think about the words, but think 
about what you hear.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.360
I didn’t say that.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.340
I didn’t say that.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.300
I didn’t say that.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.300
I didn’t say that.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.340
I didn’t say that.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.780
Ok, let’s go back and listen to the beginning of the conversation again.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.480
Uhm, David hates watermelon, he thinks.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.520
I know but I want to try it, and you said it was the best one you've ever had.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.860
I didn't say that.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.040
You said 'one of the best'?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.060
I probably said that it's an amazing watermelon and if you're going to try it again, now is the time time to try it.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.040
So we’ve said a few words to describe food and if we like that food.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.000
David hates watermelon.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.620
We can say ‘hates’.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.860
We can also say 'doesn't like' but it's not as strong and David feels very strongly about watermelon.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.020
David hates watermelon.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.280
I called it an amazing watermelon.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.060
Very good.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.740
Don’t you love amazing food?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.860
We had an amazing meal.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.840
The wine was amazing!

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.760
I said It's an amazing watermelon and if you're going to try it again, now is the time time to try it.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.560
Are you just going to have a bite of mine?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.280
- Yeah!
- Oh!

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.200
So I kept waiting for him to cut a piece of watermelon,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.320
but he didn’t do it because he didn’t want a whole piece.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.860
He decided just to have a bite of mine.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.720
Listen to how I said that.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.840
Oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.700
Again, I feel like I’m speaking quickly, and I am, but also, that’s just conversational English.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.240
It is fast.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.520
Let’s listen to this one on a loop and see if we can figure out which words are the most stressed,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.320
and where you can simplify.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.280
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.020
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.360
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.360
I hear more stress on OH, you’re, and ‘bite’ and ‘mine’.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.540
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.500
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.420
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.900
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.240
Notice how all the words run together 
smoothly with no breaks.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.940
That’s an important characteristic of American English.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.740
The contraction “you are” to “you’re” is pronounced “yer”.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.960
That’s how it’s almost always pronounced in conversational English, that’s a common reduction.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.020
yer, yer.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.220
Oh yer, oh yer.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.020
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.820
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.240
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.740
The words ‘just going to have a’ we have a few reductions there.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.000
The T in JUST is dropped

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.920
We do that when the next word begins with a consonant.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.640
The vowel reduces to the schwa.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.900
IT’s not ‘just’, it’s ‘jus’.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.680
GOING TO becomes ‘gonna’.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.760
HAVE A is ‘have a’.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.400
All of these words are lower in pitch, flatter, and said very quickly.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.360
‘just going to have a’

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.260
‘just going to have a’‘

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.980
just going to have a’

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.120
‘just going to have a’

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.420
This is what happens in conversational English.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.220
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.180
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.380
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.940
‘Bite of mine’ becomes ‘bite a’ mine’.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.540
The word ‘of’ is reduced to the schwa, and the T in BITE is a Flap T linking the two together.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.720
Bite of mine, bite of mine.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.360
Again, these changes are typical of conversational English.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.220
They're a part of what helps us make English  fast.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.760
A T is a Flap T when it comes between two vowels or diphthongs,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.560
and that's true even in two different words when the T links the two words.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.700
Bite of mine.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.520
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.400
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.540
oh, you’re just going to have a bite of mine?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.780
Ok, let’s move on. David will try the watermelon.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.460
Will he be convinced that this is an ‘amazing’ watermelon?

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.460
 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.780
What?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.780
No!

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.000
It's awful.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.200
No, David was not convinced.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.900
He called it ‘awful’.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.140
I’ve also heard him use the term ‘disgusting’.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.560
What foods do you think are awful or disgusting?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.900
Put them in the comments.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.400
What? I don't get it!

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.980
The melon-iness. It's...

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.180
Is it the texture? Or the...

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.080
No. Just the flavor.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.380
Our friend off camera asked if it was texture or taste.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.980
The texture of the food is how it feels in 
your mouth, or in your hands.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.780
It can be hard, soft, mushy, crunchy, 
slippery, smooth, and so on.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.020
Some people might not like a food for its 
texture more than it’s taste.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.880
David said, in this case, it was not the 
texture, it was the taste, the flavor.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.920
-  Is it the texture? Or the taste?
- No. Just the flavor.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.340
It's like uh...

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.000
- I don't know.
- It's such a good one.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.120
No you guys are crazy.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.000
Like you literally had to spit it out?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.040
Let’s talk for a second about the word ‘literally’ and how it’s used.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.340
In British English it sounds more like three syllables.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.920
Literally. Literally.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.580
In American English it sounds like four, and we flap the T.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.860
Literally.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.240
Literally.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.660
Literally.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.880
Literally.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.980
Now, this word is over used in American English.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.040
The meaning has morphed as a result.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.040
It’s used often for emphasis.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.760
For example, I once heard someone say:

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.280
I was so tired, I literally slept all day.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.160
Now, I know that person didn’t sleep all day. She slept a lot of day, certainly she was very tired.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.440
But she did not literally sleep all day.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.840
She did not actually sleep from sun up to sun down.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.160
She slept a lot that day.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.700
So she's using 'literally' here for emphasis.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.640
I can also picture someone saying, “I literally fell out of my chair when I heard the news.”

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.180
This would in no way mean that someone 
did literally fall out of a chair,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.360
it just adds emphasis to say how amazed they were, how caught off guard they were.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.400
I’m going to put a link in the video description to some articles about the word ‘literally’

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.520
and how its use has changed and its meaning has changed.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.140
Now, how did I use it?

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.660
like, you literally had to spit it out?”

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.960
There I am using it to mean ‘actually’.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.800
I’m not just adding emphasis.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.980
I’m asking, you had no other options than 
to actually, physically spit it out?

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.700
He claims he didn’t.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.640
like, you literally had to spit it out?

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.000
Can you do it again without spitting it?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.960
I don't want any more try. Ever.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.780
- I'm done trying.
- You'll never be convinced again?

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.320
No, this is one of the best you've ever had and I had a vomit reaction.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.260
Is there an agreement here?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.460
He said he had ‘a vomit reaction’.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.740
Another way to say vomit is to say throw 
up, which is a phrasal verb,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.960
which means your food comes back up out of you.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.900
He had a vomit reaction to watermelon.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.440
This guy really hates watermelon.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.980
- It's an excellent melon.
- It's a tasty one.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.980
So there we just heard two other opinions, 
and two other descriptors:

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.700
excellent, and tasty.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.940
Everyone else seems to really like this watermelon.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.860
I thought it was a very good watermelon. I only like watermelon really this time of year,

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:10.500
when they're the real sweet, juicy ones. I find, you know, watermelon in the off season to be pretty terrible.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.320
More descriptors: very good, sweet, juicy.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.600
Also, terrible.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.900
In the off season in the US, when they’re 
imported from farther away.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.220
I'm all in favor of this watermelon.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.880
She is all in favor of watermelon.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.680
She thinks it’s a great one.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.620
We often use the term ‘all in favor of’

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.920
when we need to challenge something, or 
part of something.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:40.980
For example, I’m all in favor of less screen time for kids, but when we’re flying, I do let him use my iPad.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:47.880
Or, I’m all in favor of exercising more, but I can’t make myself do it five times a week.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.840
I’m all in favor of--

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.900
I’m all in favor of this watermelon.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.720
I am grateful that everyone like the watermelon

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.280
I bought the watermelon at the Woods Edge farmstand

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.280
which is about a mile from here

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.700
It started out as a guy just selling stuff that he grew

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.880
sort of greenhouse, greens and vegetables

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.520
but now they buy things from the produce auction including from farther afield

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.360
So this is a Virginia-grown watermelon but uh, from the produce auction

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.960
and I found it pretty delicious

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.140
I thought it was good.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.580
My friend Jacob used the phrase ‘farther afield.’

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.820
You can also say ‘further afield’.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.200
This means not the nearest, closest, or 
most obvious place.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.560
For example, we didn’t find a solution to 
the problem with our preliminary research,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.420
so we’ll have to look further afield.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:44.440
OR, there isn’t a pet adoption agency in our neighborhood, so we’ll have to look further afield.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.300
As Jacob used it, the watermelon was not 
grown there on that local farm,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.400
but brought in from somewhere further afield, somewhere else in Virginia.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.940
But now they also buy things from the produce auction, including from father afield.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:05.020
So this is a Virginia-grown watermelon but from the produce auction and I found it pretty delicious.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.580
I thought it was good.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:11.480
Two more positive descriptors for the watermelon:  delicious, and good.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.000
So let’s review our descriptors.  The people who liked it said it was amazing,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.720
one of the best I’ve ever had, excellent, 
tasty, very good

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:30.440
Words to describe not liking it were:  hate, awful, vomit reaction, disgusting, and terrible.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.780
Okay, now this video is not over, but since I’m hungry,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.620
right now, I’m going to ask you for one of 
your favorite foods.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.720
Put it in the comments below. 
If there is a recipe is involved,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.780
put a link to a YouTube video where 
someone is making that.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:50.320
I love watching YouTube videos of people making food, like Pasta Grannies and Joshua Weismann.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.360
Ok, now that we got that taken care of, let’s review this whole short conversation again.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.960
Notice the descriptive words for food,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:04.040
and think about how you would talk about your very favorite and least favorite foods in English.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.820
Uhm, David hates watermelon, he thinks.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.760
I know, but I want to try it again. You said it was 'the best one you've ever had'.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.380
I didn't say that.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.400
You said 'one of the best'.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.360
I probably said that. I said it's an amazing watermelon and if you're going to try it again, now is the time time to try it.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.340
Oh, you're just going to have a bite of mine?

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.720
- Yeah!
- Oh!

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.020
What? No!

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.000
That is awful.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.340
What? I don't get it!

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.760
The meloniness, it's...

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.840
- Is it the texture? Or the taste?
- No, just the flavor.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.440
It's like a...

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.800
-  I don't know.
- It's such a good one.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.940
No you guys are crazy.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.900
Like you really had to spit it out?

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.780
Can you do it again without spitting it?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.460
No, I don't want any more try.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.160
Ever.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.820
- I'm done trying.
- You'll never be convinced again?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.900
No, this is one of the best you've ever had.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.400
And I had a vomit reaction.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.840
Is there an agreement here?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.300
- It's an excellent melon.
- It's a tasty watermelon.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.100
It's a tasty watermelon.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.100
I thought it was a very good watermelon.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.320
I only like watermelon really this time of the year when they're the real, sweet, jucy ones.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.560
I find, you know, watermelon in the off season to be pretty terrible.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.640
I'm all in favor of this watermelon.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.260
I'm grateful the everyone like the watermelon. I bought the watermelon at the woods edge farm stand

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.120
which is about a mile from here.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:30.940
It started out as a guy just selling stuff that he grew in a greenhouse, greens and vegetables, but now,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.300
they also buy things from the produce auction, including from father field.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:42.320
So this is a Virginia-grown watermelon but from the produce auction and I found it pretty delicious.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.060
I thought it was good.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.900
That was fun.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.980
I love making food and I love teaching English,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:53.460
check out this video I made with my friend Laura where we made an apple pie and an English lesson

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.660
at the same time.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.160
If you’ve already seen that, please check out another Rachel’s English video

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.860
from your suggested videos,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.540
keep this studying going!

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.180
I love being here, I love teaching you English,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.920
that’s it guys, and thanks so much for 
using Rachel’s English.
