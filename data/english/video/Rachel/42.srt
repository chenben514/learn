In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over how to greet Americans.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.300
As some of you know, last time I was here
in LA, at the YouTube Space, I made a video

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.220
on introducing yourself to people. At the
time, I didn't know anybody. Now, I'm back

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.880
again with all the same people. So they're
all going to be in this video again saying

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.930
'hey'.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.449
First of all, let's listen to a bunch of different
greetings.

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:34.179
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.409
&gt;&gt; Hey, Anthony.
&gt;&gt; What's up?

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:37.960
&gt;&gt; Hey, Rachel.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.510
&gt;&gt; Whassup Rachel?

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.039
&gt;&gt; Hey Veronica.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.159
&gt;&gt; Morning, guys.
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.010
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.039
&gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Hey!
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.629
&gt;&gt; Greetings.
&gt;&gt; Hey, what's going on?

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.780
&gt;&gt; Hey man.
&gt;&gt; What up, doe?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.709
You probably noticed a lot of people said
'hey'. This is definitely the most common

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:04.449
way to greet someone in America. It's pretty
casual, and I use it all the time with my

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.109
friends. Hey, hey. Notice the shape of the
voice. There's a little curve up, and then

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:17.630
a curve down in the voice. Hey, hey, hey.
So basically, it's a stressed word. We start

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.950
with the H consonant sound and go into the
AY as in SAY diphthong. Make sure you drop

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.590
your jaw enough for the first half of that
diphthong. He-e, hey, hey.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.159
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.719
&gt;&gt; Hey Veronica.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.079
&gt;&gt; Hey Rachel.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.810
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.770
We also heard 'hi' a few times. Again, it's
stressed, so we have that shape of a stressed

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.119
syllable, hi. Hi. It begins with the H consonant
sound, and we have the AI as in BUY diphthong.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.240
Again, make sure you drop your jaw enough
for the first half of that diphthong. Hi, hi.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.539
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.310
Look at that jaw drop we have on the AI as
in BUY diphthong.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.730
We also heard 'hello'. This is a two-syllable
word with stress on the second syllable. da-DA,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.489
hello. So, it's that second syllable with
the up-down shape of the voice. The first

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.569
syllable will be pretty flat: he- he-, he-.
It begins with the H consonant and has the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:34.290
EH as in BED vowel. But this is very quick,
he- he-, hello. The second syllable begins

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.830
with the L consonant, so the tongue will come
up here, ll, ll, and touch the roof of the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.830
mouth just behind the teeth. Hello. Then we
have the OH as in NO diphthong. Drop your

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.799
jaw for the first half of the sound, and make
sure you round your lips for the second half.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.700
Hello. Hello.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.150
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.110
A little bit of lip rounding here for the
second half of the OH diphthong.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.999
You may have noticed, some of the guys added
'man'. Hey man.

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.250
&gt;&gt; Hey man.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.769
It's ok to say this only to a man. But you
may have noticed that I used the term 'guys'

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.999
for a bunch of girls. So, 'guys' is a little
more gender neutral. Hey guys.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.720
&gt;&gt; Morning guys.
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.469
Because I was filming in the morning, a lot
of people said 'morning' as their greeting.

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:33.469
This is short for 'good morning'. Simply,
'morning'. Morning. Now, you could say 'afternoon'

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.849
or 'evening' during those times, but it's
not nearly as common. Morning.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.560
&gt;&gt; Morning guys.
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.890
&gt;&gt; Hey, morning guys.
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.659
Most greetings involve one of these greeting
words: hey, hi, morning, and so on, and often

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.459
a question. The appropriate way to respond
is to answer the question, and to ask the

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.870
same question yourself.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.030
For example: &gt;&gt; Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; Good,
how are you?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.769
Let's take a look at a few of these exchanges.

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.849
&gt;&gt; Staci, Kristina. Hey!
&gt;&gt; Hey, Rach!

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.459
&gt;&gt; How are you guys?
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's good to see you!

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you too! How've you been?
&gt;&gt; Good, good.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.680
&gt;&gt; Hey Scooter. What's up?
&gt;&gt; What up doe?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680
&gt;&gt; Hey Max. What's up?
&gt;&gt; Hey, how's it going?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.180
&gt;&gt; Good, how are you?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.050
&gt;&gt; Hey Jenn, hey Frankie.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.320
&gt;&gt; How are you guys doing today?
&gt;&gt; Good. How are you?

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.729
&gt;&gt; Not good.
&gt;&gt; Good. You're not good?

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.260
&gt;&gt; Not good. I just broke my phone.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.100
&gt;&gt; Hey, what's going on?
&gt;&gt; Not much. How are you?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.340
&gt;&gt; Just hanging out. I hear it's your birthday
today.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.580
&gt;&gt; It is, actually.
&gt;&gt; Happy birthday, Rachel.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.890
&gt;&gt; How are you?
&gt;&gt; Fabulous.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.950
&gt;&gt; As always!

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.229
&gt;&gt; Hey Aaron.
&gt;&gt; Hey, how are you doing?

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.270
&gt;&gt; Good, how are you?
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.750
How are you. We heard this two ways. Once
with the word 'are' stressed. How are you?

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.020
&gt;&gt; How are you guys? [3x]

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.880
How are you? But most of the time, you'll
hear it with that word reduced. How are you?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.080
&gt;&gt; How are you? [6x]

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.440
&gt;&gt; Great, how are you? [3x]

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:14.580
How are you? So, in that case, make sure it's
really short, er, er, er, how-er, how-er you.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.280
How are you, da-DA-da. How are you, da-da-DA.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.850
The most common response to this phrase is
'good'. You might sometimes hear 'great'.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.420
One person even said:

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.700
&gt;&gt; How are you?
&gt;&gt; Fabulous.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.720
&gt;&gt; As always!

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.010
And unfortunately, one person said 'not good',
because her phone had just broken.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.680
&gt;&gt; You're not good?
&gt;&gt; Not good. I just broke my phone.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.630
Another question we heard was 'how's it going?'
So we're contracting 'how is', how's, how's.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.850
So just put a Z sound there at the end of
'how'. The next word begins with a vowel,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.220
so the Z should link those two words together.
How's it, how's it, how's it going? Notice

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.890
the Stop T at the end of 'it'. We're not releasing
it: how's it going. So, just hold the air

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.990
for a second, and then release again. You
can either end with the NG consonant, ng,

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.780
or with the N consonant, nn. Goin', goin'.
It's a little more casual, but that's ok.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.090
How's it going, how's it goin'.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.590
&gt;&gt; How's it goin'?
&gt;&gt; It's goin'.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.590
&gt;&gt; Hey, how's it goin'?

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.590
Da-da-DA-da. How's it going. Again, the answers
here will be good, great, not bad, etc.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.580
What's up? This is answered just like 'what's
going on?' Usually 'nothing' or 'not much',

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.920
but you can say what you're doing in that
moment. You can hear this as 'tsup', with

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.920
the TS reduction. We also heard it as 'whassup',
where the T was dropped altogether. Whassup.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.440
And we even heard one person say 'whadup'.
So what was he doing here? He dropped the

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.440
S sound, so now the T came between two vowel
sounds. So it was a Flap T, sounding like

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.200
a D. Whadup.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.720
&gt;&gt; What's up.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.280
&gt;&gt;Whassup, Rachel?

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.550
&gt;&gt; Hey, Brysi. What's up?
&gt;&gt; Oh hey Rachel. What's up?

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.730
&gt;&gt; Hey Scooter. What's up?
&gt;&gt; Whadup doe?

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.920
I hope this was helpful. The next time you
see someone you know, don't be afraid to go

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.400
up and start a conversation. A huge thanks
to everybody who was in this video.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.670
Staci and Kristina both have awesome how-to
channels. Staci does knitting tutorials, and

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:37.930
Kristina, paper crafts. Aaron makes awesome
skateboarding videos. Anthony does music reviews.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.760
Don does children's music. Evan makes awesome
drawing tutorials.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.870
&gt;&gt; Whassup Rachel's English. How you all doing,
people? This is Evan, from your channel Cartoon

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.990
Block. Showing kids how to do their thing,
drawing and sketching and all that. Veronica

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:57.000
has great travel videos on California. Rose
and Eman both have great makeup and style

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
channels. Fabulous. Qban Guy does sketch comedy.
Sarah's crafting channel is awesome. Chris

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.760
and Hilah work on HilahCooking, a great cooking
channel. Billy does awesome children's music

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.470
with puppets. You met one of the puppets in
one of my other videos. Brysi mixes rap with

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:20.780
video games on his channel. Jason does comedy
sketches on his channel. Scooter has some

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:26.810
great 100 lists on his comedy channel. Max
No Sleeves never wears sleeves in his comedy

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.840
channel. MissJennFabulous has a nail channel,
where she did teach me a different way to

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.800
paint my nails. And Pete is a video producer
behind the scenes on several different YouTube

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.159
channels.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.169
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what does that mean? What does 'doe'
mean?

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:47.169
&gt;&gt; 'Doe' is a...urban term, which can mean
'though'. However, you just add it for that

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.919
emphasis onto the end of sentences.
&gt;&gt; Pretty much anything?

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:55.519
&gt;&gt; It's like an exclamation point, almost.
&gt;&gt; Can you say it again?

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.389
&gt;&gt; Whadup doe!

00:08:57.389 --> 00:09:04.389
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
