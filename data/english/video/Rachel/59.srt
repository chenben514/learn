00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.439
In this American English pronunciation video, you'll
come with me to the Union Square farmer's market.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.190
Today I spent some time at the farmer's market
where I did things like buy these beautiful

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:29.430
flowers. The words 'farmer' and 'market' both
have the 'ah' as in 'father' vowel followed

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.079
by the R consonant. I've noticed that this
combination can be problematic for my students.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.239
It's important to remember to make a good
'ah' vowel before moving into the R consonant.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.260
A lot of people want to rush this, and the
two sounds end up getting combined to something

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.760
like far-, far-, instead of fah-rr, fah-rr.
So, it is true with this combination that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.579
your tongue will probably start moving back
into the R as soon as you start the AH vowel.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:10.340
But it's important to start the AH vowel with
the tongue tip forward. Far, far. And make

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.340
sure you have enough jaw drop to get the good
AH vowel. When in doubt, always practice slowly.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:32.830
Ah-rr, farmer's market. Farmer's market.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:41.830
The farmer's market at Union Square has some
interesting things, like hand-dyed yarn, seafood,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.700
beautiful flowers, and sometimes, if you're
lucky, free samples.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.920
&gt;&gt; Spicy.
&gt;&gt; Is it?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.990
Did you hear how the intonation went up at
the end. Is it? This is true of questions

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.259
that can be answered with yes or no. In general,
other questions will go down in pitch at the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:21.819
end. For example, what does it taste like?
Taste like? like? it? like? Listen again.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.920
&gt;&gt; Is it? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Too spicy or just right?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.920
Here the question will be answered with either
'too spicy' or 'just right'. So, not a yes/no

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.019
question. Therefore, the sentence goes down
in pitch at the end. Just right. Right, right.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.160
Listen again.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.180
&gt;&gt; Too spicy, or just right [3x]
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.879
There's also a local vendor who brings lots
of honey, and, with that, bees. After putting

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.840
honey and bees on my finger, the beekeeper
told me the only way to get them off is with

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840
a good shake.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.329
The farmer's market also has lots of great
baked goods, like these cider donuts.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.849
&gt;&gt; Apple cider donuts.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yum!

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.870
&gt;&gt; Can I have some?
Can I have some? Again, a yes/no question,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:35.279
so the pitch went up at the end. Some? Some?
Also, did you notice how I reduced the word

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:43.329
'can' to 'kn'. We do this when it is a helping
verb in a sentence. That is, not the main

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.530
verb. Can I have some? Listen again.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.629
&gt;&gt; Can I have some? [3x]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:59.159
&gt;&gt; Oh wow. It's soft. That is good.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:07.559
&gt;&gt; Now hold up your apple.
&gt;&gt; This is my honey crisp apple.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.400
The word 'apple' is a great word to pick out
and study for pronunciation, because many

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.609
people have difficulty with the Dark L sound.
It's quite common to hear non-native speakers

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.460
substitute the OH diphthong for the dark L.
So we end up getting a sound like 'app-oh'

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.460
instead of 'apple'. App-oh, apple. So what's
the difference? When we substitute the OH

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.590
diphthong, you can see that the lips will
round. App-oh. This means that the sound is

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.069
being formed here at the front of the mouth.
But for the dark L, apple, ul, ul, the sound

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:56.530
vibrates here in the back of the mouth, and
even the throat. Ul, ul, oh, oh, ul, ul. So,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.409
how do you make the dark L? Ul, ul. To make
this, the tongue shifts back a little bit

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.460
in the back, so the tension is in the back
of the mouth, back of the tongue. Ul, that's

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:23.110
what brings the vibration here. Ul, ul, apple,
ul, ul, rather than app-oh, oh, oh. Apple,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.039
apple. There are lots of words that end with
this dark L in an unstressed syllable, like

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:37.780
'bottle', 'incredible'. So, it's really worth
getting the sound right. Ul, ul.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.090
Grape. The 'ay' diphthong is another sound
that my students sometimes have problems with.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:51.259
Ay, ay. We have to hear two distinctly different
vowel sounds, so for the first sound, the

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:58.569
jaw has to drop quite a bit, and that's the
part that my students generally miss. Ay,

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.289
ay. For the second half of the diphthong,
the tongue tip still stays down here, behind

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.169
the bottom front teeth, but the front part
of the tongue stretches up towards the roof

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:14.870
of the mouth. That's what brings the jaw up.
Ay, ay, grape.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.580
So, if you ever find yourself in the New York
area, I do recommend hitting up the farmer's

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.240
market in Union Square.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.240
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
