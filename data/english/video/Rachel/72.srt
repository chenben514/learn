00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.540
&gt;&gt; This is my friend Lynne --
&gt;&gt; Ahem.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt;&gt; Oh sorry.
&gt;&gt; Excuse me!

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.029
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry. This is my best friend Lynne --
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:14.320
&gt;&gt; and she hosted Thanksgiving this year.
So, in this video you're going to see a spread

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.000
of food like I've never seen before. And also,
we'll study a little pronunciation along the way.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.710
In this video, there are many different things

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.390
about American English pronunciation to notice.
I will point out three. They are all occurrences

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.329
of the phrase "I have got to." This phrase
will never be pronounced with that much time

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.760
because there are words in here that are function
words that need to reduce and link. I will

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.460
say this phrase once, and I notice that I
reduce it to "I've gotta." [x2] My friend

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.409
Lynne will say this phrase twice. She reduces
it to "I gotta" [x2]. When I say the phrase,

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.740
I make "I have" a contraction: I've. "Got"
and "to" reduce to "gotta" [x2]. The T here

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.740
pronounced as a flap T, or D, because it comes
between two vowels. I've gotta, I've gotta.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:32.310
Lynne reduces it further, dropping the word
"have" altogether. I gotta [x3]. Make sure

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.740
when you reduce that you link everything so
there are no gaps between the words. For example,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.020
"I've got to say," or, "I've got to see that
movie." We'll stop and take a look at these

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.020
phrases when they happen in the video. 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.700
This year we had some great side dishes: collard

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.459
greens with bacon and maple, a wild rice and
quinoa pilaf, a green salad with beets and

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:08.259
pine nuts, some bread, which I made, a corn
soufflé, and bacon-wrapped dates as an appetizer.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.870
But the star of any Thanksgiving meal is the
bird: the turkey.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.000
&gt;&gt; That's a pretty bird, Beads.
&gt;&gt; Thank you! Ok. 160 …

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.640
Here we're checking the temperature of the
bird to make sure it's cooked.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.450
&gt;&gt; 170. Ok, it's done. Yes! Oh my God!
Now she'll make a gravy using turkey stock,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.370
and the drippings from the pan that the turkey
roasted in.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:47.570
&gt;&gt; Now whisking the thickened roux. Then I'm
going to add my homemade turkey stock to make

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:57.000
a gravy. Yum. It's a little chunky. Oh look
at that! Look how it's, it's, it's happening.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.250
&gt;&gt; It's becoming gravy.
&gt;&gt; It's becoming gravy.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.000
&gt;&gt; Oo, it's delicious-looking.
&gt;&gt; I sh---you know what I should add?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.070
White wine.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah!

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.420
&gt;&gt; See I'm cutting off right now the, the,
what's that? It's the thigh and the ... 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.700
what's that called? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Thigh and the what?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.190
&gt;&gt; What's this called? The leg. The leg and
the thigh.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.370
&gt;&gt; What's this called and the answer was leg?
You couldn't remember the word leg??

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.419
&gt;&gt; You're making me nervous with your camera!
&gt;&gt; She's been cooking all day long.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.000
&gt;&gt; I know, she has been cooking all day.
&gt;&gt; I gotta find the joint. Brian, help me.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.420
OK, did you hear that? I gotta find the joint.
Lynne reduced "I have got to" to "I gotta" [x2]

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.450
Listen again.
&gt;&gt; I gotta find the joint [x3]. Brian, help me.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.850
Next, Lynne carves the turkey, and we all

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.850
enjoy an amazing Thanksgiving meal. Pie is
the traditional dessert at Thanksgiving.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.730
&gt;&gt; We had three pies this year. We had pumpkin,
which I just adore. We have pecan, which is

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.489
not my favorite, but I've got to say, this
one was really good.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.000
Did you notice? I just said "I've gotta."
[x2] "I've gotta say." Listen again.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.449
&gt;&gt; But I've gotta say [x3] this one was really
good. But I've gotta say, this one was really

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.449
good. This was a good pecan pie. And then
we have this apple, which is just gorgeous,

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.400
isn't it? Here, let me rotate it so you can
get the inside. Gorgeous, gorgeous.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.479
After everyone's eaten all the turkey and
pie they can possibly eat, there's only one

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.840
thing left to do when you've hosted 16 people
in a Brooklyn apartment.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:58.340
&gt;&gt; Man, uh, I gotta clean my floor.
And, for the third time, "I have got to" reduces.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.599
I gotta [x2], I gotta clean my floor. Listen
again.

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:13.000
&gt;&gt; I gotta clean my floor [x3].
&gt;&gt; So, would you say that the dinner was successful?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.499
&gt;&gt; I would say so.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Tell me a little bit about the evening

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.539
from the Chef's perspective.
&gt;&gt; Well, it started out a little rough because

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.860
the turkey was not ready, which was frustrating.
&gt;&gt; It took longer than you thought.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.000
&gt;&gt; It took longer than I thought. BUT, it
was well worth the wait because it was awesome.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.600
&gt;&gt; It was!
&gt;&gt; And now I'm picking the carcass. But I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.300
think everyone had fun. And everyone got along,
which is good.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.779
&gt;&gt; That's huge.
&gt;&gt; There were a lot of people that didn't

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:45.779
know each other. A lot of randoms. But, um,
food was good, and company was great, and

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:51.599
everyone laughed, and ate, and was merry,
and grateful.

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.110
&gt;&gt; That's true. That's what Thanksgiving's
all about.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.000
&gt;&gt; It's all about being grateful and counting
your blessings.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.979
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
