00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.200
It’s one of my most popular series ever&nbsp;
here on Youtube. Today it’s a compilation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.520
interviewing for a job in America. If English&nbsp;
isn’t your native language, you’re going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.680
learn some English and some important phrases&nbsp;
to know for interviewing and everybody is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.705
going to learn that you can prepare for and&nbsp;
ace your next job interview, let’s do this.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.600
You’re hired! Two words everybody loves&nbsp;
to hear. But before we hear these words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.080
comes (dun dun duuuuhn!) the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.270
interview. Today’s video is part one in a series&nbsp;
that’s all about preparing for a job interview.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.400
This is part one of a five part series on&nbsp;
preparing for an interview. Interviewing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.640
for a new job can be a huge&nbsp;
source of stress and anxiety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.080
And if you’re interviewing for a job in a&nbsp;
non-native language, the stress can be even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.040
higher. In this video you’ll see me interview for&nbsp;
a job. Throughout the interview, we’ll discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.600
some of the most common interview questions and&nbsp;
how to answer them. You’ll also learn some basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.360
information to get you started on creating your&nbsp;
own answers to these questions. Let’s begin.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.160
TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley.&nbsp;
Thanks so much for coming in.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.320
RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks&nbsp;
so much for meeting with me.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.981
TK: Of course. Did you have&nbsp;
any trouble finding the office?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.760
Small Talk. Most interviews will start out&nbsp;
with a handshake and some small talk – this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.643
may include questions about how you’re doing,&nbsp;
your travel to the interview, the weather,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.249
how your weekend went, and more. All you&nbsp;
need to do is be polite and friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.880
Keep your answers short. You can&nbsp;
also feel free to turn the question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.280
back to the interviewer. For instance, if the&nbsp;
interviewer asks you how your weekend was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.960
you might respond, “It was great, we celebrated my&nbsp;
Mom’s birthday. How was your weekend?” Small talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.200
is used to build a more comfortable environment&nbsp;
before the interview begins. It may seem silly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.760
but you can practice small talk on your own&nbsp;
by asking yourself simple, easy-to-answer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.840
non-personal questions. You could also practice&nbsp;
with a friend. Here is an example of small talk:

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.960
&gt;&gt; How are you doing?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.789
&gt;&gt; I’m great, thank you, and you?

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:16.348
&gt;&gt; How are you doing?

00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:19.040
&gt;&gt; I’m doing really well. It’s&nbsp;
such a nice day out there.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.120
&gt;&gt; It is! It was perfect weather all weekend.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.865
&gt;&gt; It was.

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:30.577
&gt;&gt; Did you do anything&nbsp;
interesting over the weekend?

00:02:30.577 --> 00:02:33.280
&gt;&gt; Yes, I went to the park&nbsp;
with my family for a picnic.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.720
&gt;&gt; That sounds nice.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.320
&gt;&gt; It was. And you?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.960
&gt;&gt; I worked this weekend, but I&nbsp;
got a lot done, so that was good.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.655
&gt;&gt; It does feel good to get work done!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.920
You can see we haven’t said much of importance,&nbsp;
but the conversation is friendly and open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.203
and can make two people feel more&nbsp;
comfortable in each other’s presence.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.240
TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley.&nbsp;
Thanks so much for coming in.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.400
RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks&nbsp;
so much for meeting with me.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.720
TK: Of course. Did you have&nbsp;
any trouble finding the office?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.280
RS: Nope. The directions&nbsp;
on the website were great.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.320
TK: Good. Would you like some&nbsp;
coffee or water before we begin?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.920
RS: I’m okay, thank you.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.320
TK: Alright. So, to get started, why don’t&nbsp;
you tell me a little bit about yourself.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.195
RS: Sure.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.000
Common Question: Tell me a little bit about&nbsp;
yourself. It’s very common for interviewers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.880
to simply ask you to tell them about yourself.&nbsp;
That can feel overwhelming! But don’t worry;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.320
what they really want you to focus on is&nbsp;
your education and work history. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.240
also let them know what areas you have a lot&nbsp;
of experience in, or what your interests are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.000
when answering this question. Here are a&nbsp;
few different ways to begin your answer.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.991
I studied at Harvard University and&nbsp;
graduated 2012 with a degree in business.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.649
I’ve been working at Smith&nbsp;
Incorporated for 10 years as a manager.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.164
I have 12 years of experience in graphic design.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.317
Because of my time at Verizon, I have a lot&nbsp;
of experience in providing customer service.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.507
If you're preparing for an interview, practice&nbsp;
talking about yourself and your work history. &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.000
Record yourself with a video camera if possible. &nbsp;
Make sure it's not too long, maybe around a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.120
minute.  Go back and listen or watch, and write&nbsp;
down phrases that worked well to use again.  If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.120
there was anything you stumbled over or left out,&nbsp;
write down some possible phrases you could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.320
used.  The next day, do the same exercise.  It's&nbsp;
important that you don't just write a paragraph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.600
and memorize it, but simply practice free-talking&nbsp;
with some key phrases. The more you practice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.960
before the interview, the more comfortable you’ll&nbsp;
feel answering the questions during the interview.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.280
TK: So, to get started, why don’t you&nbsp;
tell me a little bit about yourself.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.600
RS: Sure. I studied at the University of Florida&nbsp;
and graduated in 2010 with a Masters Degree in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.520
Toy Design. After graduation, I was hired at&nbsp;
Happy Kid’s Creative. I’ve been there for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.920
past five years and am currently the Director&nbsp;
of Toy Production. During that time sales have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.400
grown steadily. It’s been a great experience,&nbsp;
but I’ve run out of room to grow with HKC and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.400
I’m looking for new opportunities. I have a lot of&nbsp;
experience leading teams in the creative process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.560
and finding new markets for&nbsp;
the products that we create.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.237
TK: That’s great. Can you tell me&nbsp;
how you heard about this position?

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.920
Can you tell me how you heard about this&nbsp;
position? This is a common question that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.760
you’ll hear in interviews. It’s a chance to share&nbsp;
a little bit about the research that you’ve done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.440
in order to learn about the position you are&nbsp;
applying for. It’s also a chance to share if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.375
someone from inside the company let you know about&nbsp;
the position. Here are some example responses:

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.964
I heard about the position from one&nbsp;
of your current employees, Bob Greene.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.431
I heard about the position from my friend&nbsp;
Liz Miller, who works in Accounting.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.741
I saw this position on LinkedIn.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.080
I read about the position on your website.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.880
Since this is a simple question with a simple&nbsp;
answer, think about your answer and practice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.312
it out loud before your interview. Record&nbsp;
yourself and listen. Are you easy to understand?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:48.240
Are there any words that are challenging for&nbsp;
you? Practice these words separately, slowly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.640
thinking about the mouth position.&nbsp;
As it becomes more comfortable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.200
speed it up. You’re going to want to practice&nbsp;
tough words 10, 20, 30 times in a row.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.918
Build your muscle memory, so in the interview&nbsp;
it will naturally be easier to pronounce.

00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:10.000
TK: That’s great. Can you tell me&nbsp;
how you heard about this position?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.640
RS: Of course. A friend of mine saw the position&nbsp;
listed on LinkedIn and forwarded it to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.840
so I spent some time on your website learning&nbsp;
about the position and the company. I also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.649
read an article in Business Weekly about&nbsp;
your work that really got me interested.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.840
TK: What attracted you to our company?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.758
Common Question: What&nbsp;
attracted you to our company?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.040
This question gives you the opportunity&nbsp;
to share what you know about the company,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.969
and why you would like to work there. Some ways&nbsp;
to begin your response include the following.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.520
Notice that most responses show that you have a&nbsp;
strong feeling about what you learned. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.840
give the interviewer more information about who&nbsp;
you are and what you might bring to the position.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.535
I was really impressed with your&nbsp;
commitment to renewable energy.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.272
I was very excited to learn that you support&nbsp;
your research department so strongly.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.440
I read that you encourage employees&nbsp;
to spend time with each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.145
outside the workplace, and that&nbsp;
is something I really appreciate.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.000
Again, think about the answer to this question&nbsp;
before your interview, and practice your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.280
responses using recordings and repetition.&nbsp;
Even if this question is not asked, the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.760
spent practicing the response will be helpful when&nbsp;
you answer other questions during the interview.

00:08:37.714 --> 00:08:40.154
TK: What attracted you to our company?

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:45.760
RS: To be honest, what really caught my eye was&nbsp;
your focus on growth. I was really impressed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.520
your ambitious goals and the clear plan you&nbsp;
have for achieving those goals. I also like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.960
the support you provide for your employees.&nbsp;
I love your continuing education initiatives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.800
where you pay for employees to learn new techniques and skill sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.209
I think that really helps to build&nbsp;
employee satisfaction and loyalty.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.278
TK: You’ve obviously done your homework.&nbsp;
What would you say is your greatest strength?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.400
Common Question: What would you say is your&nbsp;
greatest strength? This question gives you the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.200
chance to talk about what you do really well as an&nbsp;
employee, and as a person. You can share what your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:32.080
greatest strength is, then explain how that helps&nbsp;
you in your current job or life. For example:

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.480
My greatest strength is _________. I find&nbsp;
that this is very important when I _______.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.600
My greatest strength is flexibility.&nbsp;
I find that this is very important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.840
when I’m working with lots of&nbsp;
different people and opinions.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.295
To practice answering this question,&nbsp;
write down: My greatest strength is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:04.080
(blank). Then, fill in your strength. Write down&nbsp;
how this strength is demonstrated in your life and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.960
work. You may come up with several&nbsp;
different strengths you want to highlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.000
That’s great, practice them all. But in&nbsp;
the interview, you’ll only want to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.680
one or two answers. Practice answering the&nbsp;
questions out loud, based on what you wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.080
down. But don’t just memorize written text.&nbsp;
Practice speaking freely on these ideas.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.480
TK: What would you say is your greatest strength?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:36.320
RS: I would say, my greatest strength is a&nbsp;
combination of enthusiasm and persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.640
My work ethic won’t let me settle for less&nbsp;
than my best. I’m able to persevere through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.160
challenges and setbacks without falling&nbsp;
into frustration or anger. I’ve noticed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.785
that this tends to keep those around me&nbsp;
in good spirits as well, which is a plus.

00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:54.533
TK: That’s very good.

00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:56.880
TK: Can you tell me about&nbsp;
a time where you suffered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.240
a setback and had to maintain your enthusiasm?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.040
Common Question: Can you tell me about&nbsp;
a time when you suffered a setback and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.400
had to maintain your enthusiasm? The&nbsp;
interviewer may ask questions like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.557
this to get a better sense of how you behave&nbsp;
and perform in certain stressful situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.040
The question may be about your actual past&nbsp;
experiences, or a hypothetical situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.392
to see how you would respond. Here are examples&nbsp;
of other questions that are similar to this one:

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.061
Tell me about a time when you had to&nbsp;
deal with a difficult client or coworker.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.840
Tell me about a time when you&nbsp;
had to respond to a crisis.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.278
Tell me about a time when you&nbsp;
had to give difficult feedback.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.440
How would you handle a situation&nbsp;
where you and your supervisor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.159
disagreed about an issue or course of action?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.680
You can see, there’s a lot of variety&nbsp;
in the kind of way question is asked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.403
so it’s impossible to know exactly&nbsp;
what you might need to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.120
In the days leading up to your interview, practice&nbsp;
responding to several different versions of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:17.520
question every day. This will help build important&nbsp;
vocabulary you might need in the interview,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.560
and will also help you feel ready&nbsp;
to answer questions like these.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.640
TK: Can you tell me about&nbsp;
a time where you suffered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.280
a setback and had to maintain your enthusiasm?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:34.880
RS: Sure. One definitely comes to mind. Last year&nbsp;
a project for a new toy was in its final stages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.320
after two years of work. As we were looking at the&nbsp;
branding and working up a final marketing plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.763
a competitor launched a version of the&nbsp;
exact same toy that we were launching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.181
As the leader of the project, I knew that my&nbsp;
reaction would set the tone for the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.360
I acknowledged that it was a setback, but&nbsp;
challenged the group to think of this as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:01.280
blessing in disguise. I asked them to go out&nbsp;
and buy the competitor’s product and make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.960
list of anything they wished the toy could do&nbsp;
that it didn’t. It turned out that the list was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.960
pretty long. We added these items to our toy, and&nbsp;
launched a far superior product 6 months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.040
So, in many ways, the competitor’s&nbsp;
product became the key to our success.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.920
TK: That sounds like a great victory. Now.&nbsp;
What would you consider your greatest weakness?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.520
Common Question: What do you consider to be your&nbsp;
greatest weakness? This question can be a tough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.920
one. You want to be as honest as possible when&nbsp;
answering this question. This is an opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.078
to show a future employer that you know yourself,&nbsp;
and are willing to work to improve yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.280
Share a weakness, like public speaking, or&nbsp;
attention to detail, fear of failure. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:58.237
then talk about ways you’ve worked on improvement&nbsp;
in that area. Here is a way to start a response:

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.880
My greatest weakness is ___.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.720
It shows up in my work when __.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.840
The ways I’ve worked to&nbsp;
improve in this area are __.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.400
Take a moment to think about something&nbsp;
you’ve struggled with in your work life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.880
Think of ways that you’ve worked to improve, any&nbsp;
books that you’ve read, classes you’ve taken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.592
and so on. These are the things you want to share&nbsp;
with the interviewer when answering this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.880
Remember, the important thing is&nbsp;
to show that you are aware of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.560
weak spots – and that you are already&nbsp;
working at improving in these areas.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.360
TK: Now, what do you consider&nbsp;
your greatest weakness?

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:49.200
RS: Chocolate. Just kidding! No, my biggest&nbsp;
weakness is public speaking. It’s something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.484
that I’ve spent a lot of time working on&nbsp;
and in which I’ve improved a great deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.040
I’m very comfortable in smaller meetings&nbsp;
with my teams. But when I present an idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.520
or concept to a larger audience, I still&nbsp;
experience some stage fright. At this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.080
I can handle these situations professionally,&nbsp;
but I would like to be more comfortable in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.632
moments so I can really enjoy the experience&nbsp;
of presenting, rather than just survive it.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:21.640
TK: Fear of public speaking is a very common&nbsp;
fear; I’m in the same boat on that one!

00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:25.760
TK: Where do you see yourself in five years?

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:32.640
Common Question: Where do you see yourself in&nbsp;
five years? This is a chance to share your goals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.800
for the future. You want to demonstrate that&nbsp;
you understand what is realistically achievable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:44.560
over a certain period of time. You’ll also be&nbsp;
letting the interviewer know how ambitious you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.320
with this answer. If you haven’t thought about&nbsp;
this question at all, it can be a great idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.821
to think about this before your interview.&nbsp;
Also, think about answers to two variations:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.147
where do you see yourself in one year,&nbsp;
where do you see yourself in 10 years.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.009
You start this response by saying:

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.960
In five years I would like to be ___.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.735
Practice answering this question out&nbsp;
loud as you prepare for your interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.040
If you only practice your answers in your head,&nbsp;
it will be much more stressful when you’re in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:28.240
the room with the interviewer, speaking out loud&nbsp;
for the first time. Record yourself. Critique your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:36.551
own speech. What was unclear? How you could you&nbsp;
clarify, or say more concisely, your thoughts?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.072
TK: Where do you see yourself in five years?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:46.480
RS: As I mentioned before, I’m interested in&nbsp;
growth. In five years I would like to be a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.880
of a company growing its business&nbsp;
on a regular and consistent basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.800
I’d like to be in a Vice President position&nbsp;
with a focus on development. And while I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.200
that would require much more public speaking,&nbsp;
in five years I plan on being ready for it.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.440
TK: Okay, well, I have everything I need,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.840
but do you have any questions for me,&nbsp;
about the company or the position?

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:16.720
Common Question: Do you have any questions for me?&nbsp;
So far, the interview has been about whether or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:23.597
not you would be a good fit for the company. With&nbsp;
the question “Do you have any questions for me?”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:31.040
it’s your turn to find out if the company is a&nbsp;
good fit for you. The questions you ask will also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.360
show how well you know their company&nbsp;
and the requirements of the position.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.160
Before the interview, write down any questions&nbsp;
you have about the position, the company,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:48.880
or the work environment. Then practice those&nbsp;
questions out loud. Chances are, you won’t need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.000
to ask all of them. Some might be answered&nbsp;
during the earlier parts of the interview.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.200
TK: Okay, well, I have everything I need,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.960
but do you have any questions for me,&nbsp;
about the company or the position?

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:09.360
RS: Yes. Imagine you're looking back on this&nbsp;
hiring decision in a year. The person you hired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.015
has exceeded your expectations. What did&nbsp;
he or she do that impressed you the most?

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.392
TK: That’s a great question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.120
I think in one year the person would have come&nbsp;
in and spent some time learning from the team and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.840
people that have been here a while. Then, she or&nbsp;
he will begin making changes in an informed way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.520
In one year I want this person’s team to&nbsp;
be a well-oiled machine. I want them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.827
be bouncing ideas off each other, coming up with&nbsp;
new designs and making headway into new markets.

00:18:41.418 --> 00:18:45.561
RS: That’s helpful. It’s good to&nbsp;
know what the expectations are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:49.438
Can you tell me a little bit more about the team&nbsp;
that I would be working with?

00:18:49.813 --> 00:18:56.080
TK: Sure. I believe all of them have been with the&nbsp;
company for over five years and know the ropes. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.181
would say there’s a little bit of frustration&nbsp;
currently because of our lack of growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.358
This will be the third time we’ve brought&nbsp;
in a new team leader in four years.

00:19:05.005 --> 00:19:08.292
RS: Do you know what’s causing&nbsp;
that kind of rapid turn over?

00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:13.040
T: To be honest, the last three team leaders&nbsp;
have been hired from within the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.552
And sometimes it’s hard to think outside the&nbsp;
box when you’ve been inside the box for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.042
We’re hoping to bring in some new ideas and&nbsp;
energy and get our development team back on track.

00:19:23.383 --> 00:19:28.292
RS: That makes sense. I really appreciate&nbsp;
that you’re considering me for the position.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.200
I’d love to be a part of the&nbsp;
company achieving its goals.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.600
TK: Very good. Okay. That’s great,&nbsp;
thanks so much for coming in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.400
Rachel. It’s great to meet you. I’ll&nbsp;
give you a call in the next three days.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.360
RS: Sounds good, I look&nbsp;
forward to it. Thanks again.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.467
TK: My pleasure.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.231
Notice that the interview&nbsp;
ends with another handshake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.480
You may have some more small talk at the end&nbsp;
of the interview as well. Hopefully by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.905
end of the interview you feel more comfortable&nbsp;
and confident than you did when you arrived.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.760
Today we’ll discuss things like body language,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.821
humor, and expression, and how to use&nbsp;
them to your advantage in an interview.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:13.600
First, let’s look at the complete mock interview&nbsp;
from the series. What do you notice about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:20.421
I present myself, and the interviewer? What do&nbsp;
our postures and facial expressions say to you?

00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:24.720
TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley.&nbsp;
Thanks so much for coming in.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.880
RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks&nbsp;
so much for meeting with me.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.200
TK: Of course. Did you have&nbsp;
any trouble finding the office?

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.760
RS: Nope. The directions&nbsp;
on the website were great.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.800
TK: Good. Would you like some&nbsp;
water or coffee before we begin?

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.480
RS: I’m okay, thank you.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.880
TK: Alright. So, to get started, why don’t&nbsp;
you tell me a little bit about yourself.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.800
RS: Sure. I studied at the University of&nbsp;
Florida and graduated in 2010 with a Masters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:52.320
Degree in Toy Design. After graduation,&nbsp;
I was hired at Happy Kid’s Creative.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:58.240
I’ve been there for the past five years and am&nbsp;
currently the Director of Toy Production. During&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.320
that time sales have grown steadily. It’s been a&nbsp;
great experience, but I’ve run out of room to grow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.320
with HKC and I’m looking for new opportunities.&nbsp;
I have a lot of experience leading teams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.840
in the creative process and finding new&nbsp;
markets for the products that we create.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.360
T: That’s great. Can you tell me&nbsp;
how you heard about this position?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:26.080
RS: Of course. A friend of mine saw the position&nbsp;
listed on LinkedIn and forwarded it to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.200
so I spent some time on your website learning&nbsp;
about the position and the company. I also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.157
read an article in Business Weekly about&nbsp;
your work that really got me interested.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.880
TK: What attracted you to our company?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:45.440
RS: To be honest, what really caught my eye was&nbsp;
your focus on growth. I was really impressed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.200
your ambitious goals and the clear plan you&nbsp;
have for achieving those goals. I also like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.640
the support you provide for your employees.&nbsp;
I love your continuing education initiatives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.192
where you pay for employees to learn new techniques and skill sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.718
I think that really helps to build&nbsp;
employee satisfaction and loyalty.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.840
TK: You’ve obviously done your homework.&nbsp;
What would you say is your greatest strength?

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.272
RS: I would say, my greatest strength is a&nbsp;
combination of enthusiasm and persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.320
My work ethic won’t let me settle for less&nbsp;
than my best. I’m able to persevere through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.840
challenges and setbacks without falling&nbsp;
into frustration or anger. I’ve noticed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.920
that this tends to keep those around me&nbsp;
in good spirits as well, which is a plus.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.760
TK: That’s very good. Can you tell me about a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.200
where you suffered a setback and&nbsp;
had to maintain your enthusiasm?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:48.800
RS: Sure. One definitely comes to mind. Last year&nbsp;
a project for a new toy was in its final stages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.240
after two years of work. As we were looking at the&nbsp;
branding and working up a final marketing plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.240
a competitor launched a version of the&nbsp;
exact same toy that we were launching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.135
As the leader of the project, I knew that my&nbsp;
reaction would set the tone for the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.280
I acknowledged that it was a setback, but&nbsp;
challenged the group to think of this as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.200
blessing in disguise. I asked them to go out&nbsp;
and buy the competitor’s product and make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.880
list of anything they wished the toy could do&nbsp;
that it didn’t. It turned out that the list was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.880
pretty long. We added these items to our toy, and&nbsp;
launched a far superior product 6 months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.880
So, in many ways, the competitor’s&nbsp;
product became the key to our success.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:38.317
TK: That sounds like a great victory. Now.&nbsp;
What would you consider your greatest weakness?

00:23:38.317 --> 00:23:45.600
RS: Chocolate. Just kidding! No, my biggest&nbsp;
weakness is public speaking. It’s something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.840
that I’ve spent a lot of time working on&nbsp;
and in which I’ve improved a great deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.440
I’m very comfortable in smaller meetings&nbsp;
with my teams. But when I present an idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.920
or concept to a larger audience, I still&nbsp;
experience some stage fright. At this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.560
I can handle these situations professionally,&nbsp;
but I would like to be more comfortable in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:12.112
moments so I can really enjoy the experience&nbsp;
of presenting, rather than just survive it.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.555
TK: Fear of public speaking is a very common&nbsp;
fear; I’m in the same boat on that one!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.461
Where do you see yourself in five years?

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:28.880
RS: As I mentioned before, I’m interested in&nbsp;
growth. In five years I would like to be a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.200
of a company growing its business&nbsp;
on a regular and consistent basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.120
I’d like to be in a Vice President position&nbsp;
with a focus on development. And while I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.901
that would require much more public speaking,&nbsp;
in five years I plan on being ready for it.

00:24:45.418 --> 00:24:50.080
TK: Okay, well, I have everything I need,&nbsp;
but do you have any questions for me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.835
about the company or the position?

00:24:52.244 --> 00:24:59.280
RS: Yes. Imagine you're looking back on this&nbsp;
hiring decision in a year. The person you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:05.587
hired has exceeded your expectations. What&nbsp;
did he or she do that impressed you most?

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.600
TK: That’s a great question. I think in&nbsp;
one year the person would have come in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.200
and spent some time learning from the team&nbsp;
and people that have been here a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.787
Then, she or he will begin making&nbsp;
changes in an informed way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.080
In one year I want this person’s team to&nbsp;
be a well-oiled machine. I want them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.671
be bouncing ideas off each other, coming up with&nbsp;
new designs and making headway into new markets.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.849
RS: That’s helpful. It’s good to&nbsp;
know what the expectations are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.292
Can you tell me a little bit about the team&nbsp;
that I would be working with?

00:25:40.645 --> 00:25:44.960
TK: Sure. I believe all of them have&nbsp;
been with the company for over five years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.000
and know the ropes. I would say there’s a little&nbsp;
bit of frustration currently because of our lack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.680
of growth. This will be the third time we’ve&nbsp;
brought in a new team leader in four years.

00:25:55.668 --> 00:25:58.520
RS: Do you know what’s causing&nbsp;
that kind of rapid turn over?

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:03.680
T: To be honest, the last three team leaders&nbsp;
have been hired from within the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.022
And sometimes it’s hard to think outside the&nbsp;
box when you’ve been inside the box for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.200
We’re hoping to bring in some new ideas and&nbsp;
energy and get our development team back on track.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.640
RS: That makes sense. I really appreciate&nbsp;
that you’re considering me for the position.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.760
I’d love to be a part of the&nbsp;
company achieving its goals.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.160
TK: Very good. Okay. That’s great,&nbsp;
thanks so much for coming in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.040
Rachel. It’s great to meet you. I’ll&nbsp;
give you a call in the next three days.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.000
RS: Sounds good, I look&nbsp;
forward to it. Thanks again.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.277
TK: My pleasure. 
 
 

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.680
First let’s talk about the handshake. A long&nbsp;
time ago, women used to shake hands more like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:46.960
this. But now, men and women alike use the same&nbsp;
handshake, putting your right hand forward. Make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:53.880
it firm but not too tight or aggressive. A firm&nbsp;
handshake makes a good first impression.   
 

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.680
TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley.&nbsp;
Thanks so much for coming in.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.880
RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks&nbsp;
so much for meeting with me.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.793
TK: Of course.   

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:07.247
Let’s look at my posture.  It’s good to sit upright and look alert. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:07.247 --> 00:27:14.223
don’t want to slump back or slouch, that’s&nbsp;
a bit too casual for a job interview.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:23.893
Don’t sit stiffly, but do sit upright with a&nbsp;
good energy. Let’s look at facial expressions.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.979
Notice that my face is very&nbsp;
engaged. I look excited and happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.419
That’s the message you want to send.&nbsp;
It’s not unprofessional to be energized.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:41.360
In some cultures, it might be professional to&nbsp;
be more reserved, but in America, a friendly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.840
engaged demeanor is important. Watch my&nbsp;
face as I listen to the interview questions.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.493
Smiling and nodding are a way to show&nbsp;
that you’re engaged and listening.   

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.400
When watching the interview,&nbsp;
did you notice I made a joke?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.200
TK: Now, what would you&nbsp;
consider your greatest weakness?

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.137
RS: Chocolate.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.480
Using humor or making a joke in an interview&nbsp;
can show your personality. But limit it to maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:18.775
one or two moments. Otherwise, it will distract&nbsp;
from the other important things you want to say.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:25.280
This wraps up our interview series. I hope&nbsp;
it helps you prepare for job or school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:31.680
interviews in the US. How does this compare&nbsp;
to your culture? Are interviews more casual,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.187
or more formal? Let me know in the comments below.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.141
To close, here’s the full interview one more time.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.360
TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley.&nbsp;
Thanks so much for coming in.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.520
RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks&nbsp;
so much for meeting with me.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.840
TK: Of course. Did you have&nbsp;
any trouble finding the office?

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.400
RS: Nope. The directions&nbsp;
on the website were great.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.440
TK: Good. Would you like some&nbsp;
water or coffee before we begin?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.040
RS: I’m okay, thank you.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.440
TK: Alright. So, to get started, why don’t&nbsp;
you tell me a little bit about yourself.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.360
RS: Sure. I studied at the University of&nbsp;
Florida and graduated in 2010 with a Masters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.960
Degree in Toy Design. After graduation,&nbsp;
I was hired at Happy Kid’s Creative.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.880
I’ve been there for the past five years and am&nbsp;
currently the Director of Toy Production. During&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:22.960
that time sales have grown steadily. It’s been a&nbsp;
great experience, but I’ve run out of room to grow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.960
with HKC and I’m looking for new opportunities.&nbsp;
I have a lot of experience leading teams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.800
in the creative process and finding new&nbsp;
markets for the products that we create.

00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:38.709
T: That’s great. Can you tell me&nbsp;
how you heard about this position?

00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:44.640
RS: Of course. A friend of mine saw the position&nbsp;
listed on LinkedIn and forwarded it to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.840
so I spent some time on your website learning&nbsp;
about the position and the company. I also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.683
read an article in Business Weekly about&nbsp;
your work that really got me interested.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.520
TK: What attracted you to our company?

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:04.080
RS: To be honest, what really caught my eye was&nbsp;
your focus on growth. I was really impressed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.840
your ambitious goals and the clear plan you&nbsp;
have for achieving those goals. I also like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:15.280
the support you provide your employees.&nbsp;
I love your continuing education initiatives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.730
where you pay for employees to learn new techniques and skill sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.733
I think that really helps to build&nbsp;
employee satisfaction and loyalty.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:29.280
TK: You’ve obviously done your homework.&nbsp;
What would you say is your greatest strength?

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:37.049
RS: I would say, my greatest strength is a&nbsp;
combination of enthusiasm and persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.960
My work ethic won’t let me settle for less&nbsp;
than my best. I’m able to persevere through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.480
challenges and setbacks without falling&nbsp;
into frustration or anger. I’ve noticed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.560
that this tends to keep those around me&nbsp;
in good spirits as well, which is a plus.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.400
TK: That’s very good. Can you tell me about a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.840
where you suffered a setback and&nbsp;
had to maintain your enthusiasm?

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:07.440
RS: Sure. One definitely comes to mind. Last year&nbsp;
a project for a new toy was in its final stages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.800
after two years of work. As we were looking at the&nbsp;
branding and working up a final marketing plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.880
a competitor launched a version of the&nbsp;
exact same toy that we were launching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.638
As the leader of the project, I knew that my&nbsp;
reaction would set the tone for the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.840
I acknowledged that it was a setback, but&nbsp;
challenged the group to think of this as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.960
a blessing in disguise. I asked them to&nbsp;
go out and buy the competitor’s product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.960
and make a list of anything they wished the toy&nbsp;
could do that it didn’t. It turned out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:45.200
list was pretty long. We added these items to our&nbsp;
toy, and launched a far superior product 6 months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.520
later. So, in many ways, the competitor’s&nbsp;
product became the key to our success.

00:31:51.644 --> 00:31:56.480
TK: That sounds like a great victory. Now.&nbsp;
What would you consider your greatest weakness?

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:04.240
RS: Chocolate. Just kidding! No, my biggest&nbsp;
weakness is public speaking. It’s something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.695
that I’ve spent a lot of time working on&nbsp;
and in which I’ve improved a great deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.080
I’m very comfortable in smaller meetings&nbsp;
with my teams. But when I present an idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:20.560
or concept to a larger audience, I still&nbsp;
experience some stage fright. At this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.120
I can handle these situations professionally,&nbsp;
but I would like to be more comfortable in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.480
moments so I can really enjoy the experience&nbsp;
of presenting, rather than just survive it.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.853
TK: Fear of public speaking is a very common&nbsp;
fear; I’m in the same boat on that one!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.760
Where do you see yourself in five years?

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:47.440
RS: As I mentioned before, I’m interested in&nbsp;
growth. In five years I would like to be a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:52.112
of a company growing its business&nbsp;
on a regular and consistent basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.760
I’d like to be in a Vice President position&nbsp;
with a focus on development. And while I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:03.160
that would require much more public speaking,&nbsp;
in five years I plan on being ready for it.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.400
TK: Okay, well, I have everything I need,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.637
but do you have any questions for me,&nbsp;
about the company or the position?

00:33:11.114 --> 00:33:18.560
RS: Yes. Imagine you're looking back on this&nbsp;
hiring decision in a year. The person you hired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:24.215
has exceeded your expectations. What did&nbsp;
he or she do that impressed you most?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.400
TK: That’s a great question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.400
I think in one year the person would have come&nbsp;
in and spent some time learning from the team and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:39.120
people that have been here a while. Then, she or&nbsp;
he will begin making changes in an informed way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.720
In one year I want this person’s team to&nbsp;
be a well-oiled machine. I want them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.800
be bouncing ideas off each other, coming up with&nbsp;
new designs and making headway into new markets.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.489
RS: That’s helpful. It’s good to&nbsp;
know what the expectations are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.480
Can you tell me a little bit about the team&nbsp;
that I would be working with?

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:04.000
TK: Sure. I believe all of them have been with&nbsp;
the company for over five years and know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.640
ropes. I would say there’s a little bit of&nbsp;
frustration currently because of our lack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.320
of growth. This will be the third time we’ve&nbsp;
brought in a new team leader in four years.

00:34:14.308 --> 00:34:17.584
RS: Do you know what’s causing&nbsp;
that kind of rapid turn over?

00:34:17.959 --> 00:34:22.320
T: To be honest, the last three team leaders&nbsp;
have been hired from within the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.560
And sometimes it’s hard to think outside the&nbsp;

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.147
We’re hoping to bring in some new ideas and&nbsp;
energy and get our development team back on track.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.840
RS: That makes sense. I really appreciate&nbsp;
that you’re considering me for the position.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.793
I’d love to be a part of the&nbsp;
company achieving its goals.

00:34:41.202 --> 00:34:44.800
TK: Very good. Okay. That’s great,&nbsp;
thanks so much for coming in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.680
Rachel. It’s great to meet you. I’ll&nbsp;
give you a call in the next three days.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.640
RS: Sounds good, I look&nbsp;
forward to it. Thanks again.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.781
TK: My pleasure.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.320
Thank you so much for watching,&nbsp;
I make new videos every Tuesday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.280
and I love to see you back here, please&nbsp;
like and subscribe with notifications,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.480
you can keep your learning going right now with&nbsp;
this video. I make new videos every Tuesday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.480
I’ll see you next week. That’s it and thanks&nbsp;
so much for using Rachel’s English.
