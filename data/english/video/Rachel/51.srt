00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.540
I'm here to make a video with my friend Tom.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.500
&gt;&gt; We were in a show together.
&gt;&gt; It's true.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.660
&gt;&gt; About 10 years ago.
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. We were in love with each other

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.200
in the show.
&gt;&gt; We were! Our characters---

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.720
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; ---were in love with each other.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.759
&gt;&gt; It was not a 'show-mance' situation.
&gt;&gt; We were not in love.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.000
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; No. Just the show.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.600
&gt;&gt; That was beautiful.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.720
&gt;&gt; Ok, no, we're good. We're good. Ok. Are
you ready?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660
&gt;&gt; I'm ready.
&gt;&gt; Ok, me too.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.910
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone. I'm here with my friend Tom.
Tom's going to be teaching a course for me

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.760
starting in February. Now, if you don't care
about the courses, don't worry. This video

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.519
is also going to have a pronunciation exercise
at the end.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.290
&gt;&gt; So, I've known Tom for 10, probably more
than 10 years. More than 10.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.640
&gt;&gt; It is more than 10.
&gt;&gt; A long time.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's, like, 12, 13 years.
&gt;&gt; Anyway, he's going to be a fantastic teacher,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.680
let me tell you why. First of all, he's a
musician. And, if you know anything about

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.780
my background, that is also mine. My training
was in classical singing. I didn't train in

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.590
linguistics or even in ESL. And, so he has
the same background that I have. He thinks

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.560
about rhythm and pitch the same way I do,
and he also has a very good ear, to pick out

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.970
specifically what's not going right in a word
or a phrase. Also, Tom's an actor. He has

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.550
a Master's degree, which he got from Harvard
University.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.530
&gt;&gt; Very impressive.
&gt;&gt; And, tell me a little bit about, I mean, I assume

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.679
you studied speech, and phonetics, that kind
of thing.

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.409
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. IPA was taught in speech
class. Um, we had speech and voice class,

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.150
which are two separate things. So, speech
was about the articulation and mechanics of

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.470
the mouth as you're making the sounds, to
be understood from the stage. And then voice

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.340
was about opening up the body for more of
a placement exercise, so that you were resonating

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.360
in a way that got the sound out into the house,
or the audience. Um, obviously speaking from

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.840
stage and speaking in everyday is very different.
Um, there's some things you just don't need

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.160
to worry about, speaking everyday English.
&gt;&gt; But, can I say?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.209
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Placement is a huge issue that I'm always

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.969
talking about with my students.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.819
&gt;&gt; So, I'm really glad to hear that you have
a background in that too.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.760
&gt;&gt; For sure. Yeah. And there's lots of exercises
to try and open up placement, for someone

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.949
who comes from a language where, maybe things
are nasalized, and you want to bring it down.

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.829
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's so important.
&gt;&gt; There are lots of exercises to try and

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.049
open up the chest.
&gt;&gt; And Tom's also been studying with me since

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.689
September, so by the time the course starts
it'll be four, or four and half months.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.259
And, I just, I feel like you've learned a
lot.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.089
&gt;&gt; I have.
&gt;&gt; You've learned a lot about my style.

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:47.029
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, Tom. Take his course, and get to know

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.489
him. You'll love him as much as I do, I'm
sure.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.709
&gt;&gt; Please, we have five spots left and I would
love to have you in the class.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.459
I did promise there was going to be a pronunciation
exercise component, so we're going to turn

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.379
that conversation into an imitation exercise.
So you'll hear little fragments of the conversation

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.879
three times, then there will be a space for
you to repeat. Now, you might not be able

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.129
to get in every sound, but that's ok. We're actually
focusing on the rhythm and the stress here.

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.559
So, for example, if you were to hear the phrase:
I don't know [3x], and you thought, I don't

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:27.139
have time to say all those sounds, then just
do the rhythm and the pitch: uh. We're practicing

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.589
getting that in our ear. It's not about the
sounds. It's about the rhythm, and the pitch,

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.439
and the character of American English. Have
fun with it.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.419
Hi everyone.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:50.019
I'm here with my friend Tom.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:04:01.229
Tom's going to be teaching
a course for me

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:10.019
starting in February.

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:25.089
Now, if you don't care about 
the courses, don't worry.

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:35.050
This video is also going to have

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:47.019
a pronunciation exercise 
at the end.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:56.000
&gt;&gt; So, I've known Tom for

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.810
10, probably more than 10 years.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.159
More than 10.

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.559
&gt;&gt; It is more than 10.

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:25.770
&gt;&gt; A long time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:36.090
&gt;&gt; It's, like, 12, 13 years.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.360
&gt;&gt; Anyway, he's going to be a fantastic teacher,
let me tell you why.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:48.560
First of all, he's a musician.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:06:01.520
And, if you know anything about my background,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.529
that is also mine.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:12.449
My training was in classical singing.

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.489
I didn't train in linguistics or even in ESL.
And, so he has the same background that I have.

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:35.439
He thinks about rhythm and pitch the same
way I do,

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:48.010
and he also has a very good ear,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.489
to pick out specifically what's not going
right in a word or a phrase. Also,

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:59.650
Tom's an actor.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.179
He has a Master's degree, which he got from
Harvard University.

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:11.029
&gt;&gt; Very impressive.

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:25.762
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
