00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.299
In this American English pronunciation exercise,
we're going to study some conversation. Today

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.299
it's going to be an imitation exercise, where
we listen to speech on a loop, like this:

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.250
today I woke up...[3x]

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.250
Today's topic: what did you do today?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.340
For imitation exercises, I loop a sentence
or a sentence fragment three times, then give

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.340
you time to repeat. It's more important to
focus on imitating than what you're saying.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.580
By looping it three times, I hope you'll hear
the speech in a different way: more as rhythm

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.650
and pitch than as words and sounds. In fact,
sometimes, you might want to repeat back only

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.370
the rhythm and the pitch, no text at all.
For example,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.330
How are you? [3x]

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.360
Uhhh-- instead of trying to say 'how are you?',
just going with the rhythm and the pitch.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.860
Uhh. Other times, repeat the text. But don't
worry about how you think the words should

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.720
be pronounced. Just think about what you're
hearing, and reproducing it exactly.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.820
Great. Let's get started.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.050
&gt;&gt; Tom, what did you do today?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.010
&gt;&gt; Today? &gt;&gt; Today.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.470
&gt;&gt; Today I woke up...

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.740
&gt;&gt; ...and I went for a run.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.050
&gt;&gt; And, um, then I just worked.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:02.800
&gt;&gt; So, where do you run?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.140
&gt;&gt; I run in Fort Greene Park.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:30.790
&gt;&gt; In Brooklyn.
0:02:30.790,0:02:27.159
&gt;&gt; That's a nice park.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.660
&gt;&gt; It is a nice park.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.450
&gt;&gt; But, isn't it really small?

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.010
&gt;&gt; It's a very small park.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.180
&gt;&gt; So, how, how do you run there?

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:06.889
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, it's on a hill,

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:13.849
&gt;&gt; Fort Greene is on a hill.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:24.010
&gt;&gt; So, it's very hilly terrain to run.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:35.370
&gt;&gt; And you run around this dirt track around
the outside.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.700
&gt;&gt; So you just run loops.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:54.049
&gt;&gt; Right. And you do, like, 50 loops?

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:02.030
&gt;&gt; I do 50-100

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.430
&gt;&gt; depending on how I'm feeling.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.260
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:23.690
&gt;&gt; So, what are you doing after this?

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.569
&gt;&gt; After this,

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.019
&gt;&gt; Nothing.

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:44.300
&gt;&gt; No plans.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.070
&gt;&gt; Should we get dinner?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:03.019
&gt;&gt; Where should we get dinner?

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:10.010
&gt;&gt; I don't know, somewhere in the neighborhood.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:18.020
&gt;&gt; There's good stuff around here.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.520
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.030
&gt;&gt; I'll find us something.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.059
&gt;&gt; We're in Chelsea.

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:37.020
&gt;&gt; right now.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.400
&gt;&gt; We are in Chelsea.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:56.709
&gt;&gt; But we're really close to the Union Square
area.

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:58.019
&gt;&gt; Flatiron...
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:05.059
&gt;&gt; We have lots of options.

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:16.099
&gt;&gt; Rachel knows a lot about the Union Square
area.

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.269
&gt;&gt; I used to live there.
&gt;&gt; She used to live there, for?

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:25.310
&gt;&gt; Like, four years.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.549
&gt;&gt; Four years.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:34.170
&gt;&gt; There's a Barnes and Noble there.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:45.370
&gt;&gt; And a very strange sculpture.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.520
&gt;&gt; On the side of a building...

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:58.449
&gt;&gt; that used to be a Circuit City.

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:06.590
&gt;&gt; Wait, what sculpture?

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.150
&gt;&gt; There's a sculpture,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:20.580
&gt;&gt; A round sculpture spews smoke.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.200
&gt;&gt; Oh right, right.
&gt;&gt; Or steam.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:32.449
&gt;&gt; So that used to be a Circuit City?

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.370
&gt;&gt; It did.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.009
&gt;&gt; What is it now?

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:49.369
&gt;&gt; Is it a Best Buy?

00:07:49.369 --> 00:08:05.369
&gt;&gt; I'm not quite sure why we're talking about
this!

00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:06.979
And now the whole conversation:

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:10.509
&gt;&gt; Tom, what did you do today?
&gt;&gt; Today?

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:13.249
&gt;&gt; Today.
&gt;&gt; Today I woke up and I went for a run.

00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:16.629
&gt;&gt; And, um, then I just worked.
&gt;&gt; So, where do you run?

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:21.099
&gt;&gt; I run in Fort Greene Park, in Brooklyn.
&gt;&gt; That's a nice park.

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:23.749
&gt;&gt; It is a nice park.
&gt;&gt; But, isn't it really small?

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:27.499
&gt;&gt; It's a very small park.
&gt;&gt; So, how, how do you run there?

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:31.729
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, it's on a hill, Fort
Greene is on a hill. So, it's very hilly terrain

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:33.760
to run. And you run around this dirt track
around the outside.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.840
&gt;&gt; So you just run loops.
&gt;&gt; Right. And you do, like, 50 loops?

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.740
&gt;&gt; I do 50-100 depending on how I'm feeling.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.420
&gt;&gt; So, what are you doing after this?
&gt;&gt; After this, nothing.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.360
&gt;&gt; No plans.
&gt;&gt; No plans.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.720
&gt;&gt; Should we get dinner?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.380
&gt;&gt; Where should we get dinner?
&gt;&gt; I don't know, somewhere in the neighborhood.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.149
&gt;&gt; There's good stuff around here.
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:08:56.149 --> 00:08:59.840
&gt;&gt; I'll find us something.
&gt;&gt; We're in Chelsea right now.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.040
&gt;&gt; We are in Chelsea. But we're really close to 
the Union Square area, Flatiron...

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.690
&gt;&gt; That's true.
&gt;&gt; We have lots of options.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.690
&gt;&gt; Rachel knows a lot about the Union Square
area.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.329
&gt;&gt; I used to live there.
&gt;&gt; She used to live there, for?

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:11.560
&gt;&gt; Like, four years.
&gt;&gt; Four years.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; There's a Barnes and Noble there. And a

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.730
very strange sculpture on the side of a building
that used to be a Circuit City.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.750
&gt;&gt; Wait, what sculpture?
&gt;&gt; There's a sculpture, a round sculpture

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.510
that spews smoke
&gt;&gt; Oh right, right.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.660
&gt;&gt; Or steam.
&gt;&gt; So that used to be a Circuit City?

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.750
&gt;&gt; It did.
&gt;&gt; What is it now?

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.770
&gt;&gt; Is it a Best Buy? I'm not quite sure 
why we're talking about this!

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.640
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
