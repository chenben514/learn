&gt;&gt; I'm going to go to bed. Good night everybody!
&gt;&gt; Good night, Rachel!

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.680
[yawn!] I'm tired. Good night fans! Let's
listen to a bunch of different people say

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.910
that phrase.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.710
&gt;&gt; Good night, Rachel.
&gt;&gt; Good night!

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.519
&gt;&gt; Good night!
&gt;&gt; Good night Rachel.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.659
&gt;&gt; Good night.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.760
&gt;&gt; Night, Audrey.
&gt;&gt; Good night!

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.309
&gt;&gt; Good night Leon!
&gt;&gt; Good night.

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:10.219
&gt;&gt; Good night.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.499
&gt;&gt; Good night, Savannah.
&gt;&gt; Good night.

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.329
&gt;&gt; Night!
&gt;&gt; Good night, Rachel.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.149
&gt;&gt; Good night!
&gt;&gt; Good night!

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.609
&gt;&gt; Night!

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:23.490
Did you notice how most people reduced the
word 'good' to just the G sound? G'night,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.039
g'night! Let's hear a few people say that.

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.810
&gt;&gt; G'night Rachel!
&gt;&gt; G'night!

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.649
&gt;&gt; G'night!
&gt;&gt; G'night!

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.369
G'night! How do we say that phrase? Gg, gg.
To make the G sound, the back of the tongue

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.359
lifts up and touches the soft palate. To make
the N sound, the front part of the tongue

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:49.409
lifts up to the top of the mouth: g-nnn-a.
Then it comes back down for the AI as in BUY

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.740
diphthong. We do need some jaw drop for the
first half of that diphthong. G'ni-. Then,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.600
for the second half, the tongue lifts up towards
the roof of the mouth, the tip stays down

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.000
but the front part lifts, and so the jaw is
less lowered. G'night, g'night!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.530
What's happening to the T? That's a Stop T.
That means I'm just stopping the air in my

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.560
throat. G'night, g'night! Some part of my
tongue is lifting up to the roof of the mouth.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.720
It might be the front part, like is necessary
for the T position, but it also just might

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.740
be something further back. It's a little bit
more lazy. G'night, g'night. So when I'm making

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.680
it there, the tongue tip stays down and the
middle part is reaching and touching the roof

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.220
of the mouth. But the important part is that
we're stopping the air in the throat. G'night,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.220
g'night. That cuts off the sound, which signifies
the Stop T. G'night.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.050
Some people drop the word 'good' altogether
and just say 'night!'

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.060
&gt;&gt; Night!
&gt;&gt; Night!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.570
So, when you're parting ways with a friend
at night, or you're getting ready to go to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.580
bed, this is what you can say. G'night! G'night,
guys!

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.760
If there's a phrase you would like to learn
how to pronounce better, please put it in

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.190
the comments below.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.849
BONUS!! Did you notice how I used the word
'gonna'? I'm gonna go to bed.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.480
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go to bed.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.920
Gonna, gonna. This is a great reduction. Americans
use it all the time. It's not slang, it's

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.340
not uneducated, it's not lazy. It's just a
very integral part of spoken American English.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.430
So don't be afraid to use it.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.980
I'm gonna go do bed. G'night, guys!

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.980
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
