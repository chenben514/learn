00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.220
In this American English pronunciation video,
you're going to come with me to the YouTube

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.220
space in LA where I don't know anyone. And
we're going to go over introducing yourself.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.009
Introducing yourself to a crowd of people,
or even just one person, can make anyone nervous.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.869
Doing it in a foreign language, even more
so. So today we're going to go over a few

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.840
phrases that you might say when introducing
yourself.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.540
The first thing, of course, is saying your
name.&nbsp; Usually you'll hear people say "I'm",

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.910
or "My name is", or "My name's", contracting
"name" and "is".&nbsp; Some non-native speakers

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.620
don't want to use contractions because they
don't think it's clear enough, but we really

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.570
do want to use the contraction "I'm", and
not "I am" because it can be much quicker,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.440
I'm, I'm, I'm, which puts the emphasis on
the name, the most important part.&nbsp; This

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.369
will also help smooth out your speech.&nbsp; I'm
Rachel, uhhh. All connected.&nbsp; Here are some

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.470
people introducing themselves using "I'm".

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.690
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Beth Aweau.
&gt;&gt; Hey guys. I'm Olga Kay.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.830
&gt;&gt; I'm Staci Perry.
&gt;&gt; Um, hey guys. I'm Todd Bieber.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.780
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone. I'm Veronica Hill.
&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm Rachel.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.019
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Hilah.
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Rachel.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:28.719
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Christopher.
&gt;&gt; I'm Bryan.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.900
Here's an example of someone saying "my name
is," without contracting "name" and "is".

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.090
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone. My name is Hetal Jannu.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.890
Notice that the stress of the sentence is
still making her name the most important part.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.639
My name is Hetal. My name is Rachel.&nbsp; da-Da-da-DA-da.&nbsp;
It's longer, louder, and higher in pitch than

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:57.789
the unstressed syllables.&nbsp; My name is Rachel,
Ra-, My name is Rachel. That's how we know

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:04.139
it's the most important part.&nbsp; So in the
phrase "my name is", "my" and "is" are both

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:12.480
unstressed, and so they need to be really
unimportant, really quick, my [3x], is [3x].

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.130
My name is, my name is. If every syllable
is the same length, the same volume, the same

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.000
pitch, then we loose the character of American
English, which is based on stressed vs. unstressed

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.910
syllables.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.030
We can also say "My name's Rachel", with the
contraction. The rhythm there is da-DA-DA-da.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.400
"Name" is stressed because it's a noun.&nbsp;
But my actual name, Rachel, will be more stressed.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.510
And I should say, it's only the stressed syllable, Ra-,
of my name that's going to be longer and higher

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.000
in pitch.&nbsp; The unstressed syllable, -chel, is just
like any other unstressed syllable, even though

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.540
it's in a stressed word.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.200
&gt;&gt; My name's Aaron.
&gt;&gt; Uh, what's up guys. My name's Todd.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.870
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name's Sara.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.440
Often what comes next in an introduction is
saying where you're from.&nbsp; This can either

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.830
be a job, if you're in a work context, or
a place, your hometown or where you're currently

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.960
living.&nbsp; "From".&nbsp; That's never going to
be as important as the name of the place you're

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.340
from.&nbsp; It's a function word, so we want it
to be unstressed, shorter than the stressed

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.010
syllables in the sentence, from, from.&nbsp; Listen
to these people introducing the places they're

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.900
from.&nbsp; They're using the contraction "I'm"
and "from" and then the name.&nbsp; These two

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.370
words are quicker and less important:&nbsp; I'm
from [3x].&nbsp; I'm from Florida.&nbsp; I'm from

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.900
New York.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.069
&gt;&gt; I'm from Kapolei, Hawaii.
&gt;&gt; ...from Seattle originally.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.580
&gt;&gt; I'm from New York. You're from Texas?
&gt;&gt; You're from, where, again?

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.930
&gt;&gt; I'm from Delaware.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.940
Here's one last example of someone saying
"I'm from", but he's giving his business,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.770
the company he works for, not a city.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:11.920
&gt;&gt; I'm from Upright Citizens' Brigade, uh,
channel: UCBcomedy.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.659
One fun moment I noticed is when Todd introduced
himself and Bryan said "Ts'up Todd?"&nbsp; Tsup,

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:19.499
tsup.

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:25.370
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Tsup, Todd? [4x]

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.789
Tsup.&nbsp; What is that word?&nbsp; That's actually
"what's up?"&nbsp; I made a video a while ago

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:41.449
on "tsup":&nbsp; how we'll sometimes reduce "what's",
"it's", "that's", or "let's" to simply "ts".

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.520
Tsup?&nbsp; Now I know you're probably not hearing
the P, but maybe you do notice my lips are

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.259
going into the position for it.&nbsp; Tsup.&nbsp;
P is a stop consonant.&nbsp; That means it's made

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:01.150
up of two parts.&nbsp; The stop, where the lips
come together, tsup, and the release, where

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:09.669
the lips part.&nbsp; tsup.&nbsp; Sometimes native
speakers leave out the release:&nbsp; tsup?

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:16.949
Stop.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; You can too, just make sure
you don't leave out the stop part of the consonant,

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.529
where the lips come together and the air is
stopped.&nbsp; Tsup?

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.979
And finally, a phrase we often exchange when
making an introduction is "nice to meet you".

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.789
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you, too.

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.999
&gt;&gt; Well, it was good to meet you, Hilah.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you, too.

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.599
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.680
Most people say 'nice to meet you', and probably
you noticed that once I said "it's good to

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.729
meet you".&nbsp; "Nice", or "good", or whatever
adjective you're using, and "meet" should

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.370
be the two stressed syllables of that sentence.&nbsp;
That will contrast nicely with "to", which

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.349
will have a schwa instead of the OO as in
BOO vowel, to, to, to.&nbsp; "You", since it's

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:04.080
at the end of a sentence, will probably sound
something like:&nbsp; you, you, you.&nbsp; Low in

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.039
pitch, quick, flat, and with a lot of the
energy of the voice taken out.&nbsp; You, you,

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.029
nice to meet you.

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:18.210
We heard two different ways of pronouncing
the T in "meet".&nbsp; One is a stop T, because

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.639
the next word begins with a consonant sound.&nbsp;
Meet you, meet you.&nbsp; I cut off the airflow

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.909
in my throat to stop the sound, to signify
the T.&nbsp; I don't actually bring my tongue

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:38.529
into position for the T, I just stop the air
here.&nbsp; Meet you.&nbsp; The other way of making

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:45.819
the T is to make it a CH sound.&nbsp; This can happen 
to an ending T if the next word is "you", meet you,

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:50.589
meet you.&nbsp; So first, let's hear it again
with the stop.

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:55.159
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. [4x]

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.780
And now with the CH sound.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.099
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. [4x]

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:06.199
Meet you, meet you.&nbsp; Both are ok.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.379
In closing, here is one more introduction
conversation I had with a great guy I met

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:12.969
in LA named Zachary.

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:16.620
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; Oh, hey.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.029
&gt;&gt; I'm Rachel.
&gt;&gt; I'm Zach.

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:20.929
&gt;&gt; Hi Zach, nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:24.740
&gt;&gt; So, we're here at the YouTube Space. So
you must be a YouTuber.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.239
&gt;&gt; Yep. Make videos for kids.
&gt;&gt; Yeah? What's your channel?

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.300
&gt;&gt; Pancake Manor.
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.900
&gt;&gt; What's yours?
&gt;&gt; Mine's Rachel's English.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.490
&gt;&gt; Oo.
&gt;&gt; So I teach English on my channel.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:42.309
&gt;&gt; Wow. You must have a lot of subscribers.
&gt;&gt; I do, I do. But actually, let's talk about

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:48.839
that word. It's subscribers, with an R.
&gt;&gt; Oh. Subscribers.

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:54.220
&gt;&gt; Subscrrrr-, hold out the R.
&gt;&gt; Subscrr, rr, -scribers.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it!
&gt;&gt; Subscribers.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.599
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:03.150
&gt;&gt; I'm going to tell my users about your channel,
so they can go see you.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.339
&gt;&gt; Cool, thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It was great to meet you.

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:07.440
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Ok, have a great day.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.259
&gt;&gt; You too.
&gt;&gt; Alright, take care!

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:13.789
