00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
In this American English pronunciation video, we're going to study real-life English while I make an apple pie

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.100
with my dear friend Laura.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.820
Okay, time to eat the caramel sauce.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.920
Caramel. Caramel. Caramel.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.580
They're all okay. They're all okay. Okay.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.900
Hmm… this tasty word can be pronounced three ways.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.760
Caramel. Caramel. Or caramel.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.360
Each pronunciation is accepted and you will find all three of these pronunciations listed in the dictionary.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.660
Here's what it says.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.680
Whisk in a medium saucepan.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.920
Now it doesn't say over medium-low heat.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.500
Okay.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.140
Okay.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.760
-I'll do that. 
-Okay.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.980
Notice how we respond to each other. K and mkay.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.360
These are both common variants of the word ‘okay’.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.600
This word is used a lot in conversational English.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.440
It can be used to say ‘I understand, I'm listening’

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.140
which is how Laura and I both use it here.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.960
Over medium-low heat.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.460
K. Mkay.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.520
I've read a part of the recipe and we're both saying I understand that.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.740
Then she offers to take care of it and I say ‘mkay’ again here, meaning I understand.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.520
-I'll do that.
-Okay.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.360
We also use it for ‘yes’.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.920
Will you add the sugar?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.700
Okay.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.420
Over a medium low heat.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.620
-K. 
-Mkay.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.300
-I'll do that. 
-Okay.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.280
Here's what it says. Hmm…

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.740
So we do this until the sugar is dissolved then we add the butter

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.660
-which I put out on the counter.
-with a stick.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.420
-Just light on the butter. 
-Yeah.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.820
You know, it's not… this, this pie is not very high in calories.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.760
So that's false.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.080
False.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.640
I've said something here that's not true. It's false.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.060
I'm not being serious.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.820
The pie is very high in calories.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.480
Listen to the different ways you can say I'm not being serious.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.400
False. I'm joking. I'm being facetious.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.120
I'm just kidding.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.180
- How else could you say that?
- She's joking.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.160
You already say that?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.060
- I did say that. I'm pulling my leg. 
-You’re pulling your leg.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.240
Yeah, I'm pulling your leg. It's a high in calorie pie.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.220
Okay so um...

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.940
- Just joshing…
- I'm just joshing you.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.480
Where does that one come from?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.540
I'm just Joshin.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.700
You could say that. I'm just joshing. Hey, don't get upset. I'm just Joshin.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.860
I'm joking. I'm being facetious. I'm just kidding. I'm pulling your leg. I'm just joshing.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.600
All of these things mean what I'm saying should not be taken seriously or literally.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.580
I could have also said I'm just playing or I'm playing.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.620
The word ‘just’ in all of these phrases can be used but doesn't have to be used.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.660
A note on the pronunciation of the word ‘just’,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.620
if it's followed by a word that begins with the consonant, the T will usually be dropped.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.180
For example, I'm just kidding.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.600
Jus kidding.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.280
Straight from the S sound into the K with no T.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.240
False. I'm joking. I'm being facetious.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.680
I'm just kidding.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.180
I'm pulling your leg. It's a high in calorie pie.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.360
I'm just joshing you.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.340
Where does that one come from?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.900
You want to grab the stick of butter?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.180
Yeah.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.360
So every fall, for what, how many years have you been doing this?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720
Well we've lived here since 2010.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.080
- No way. 
- And it probably started...

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.280
No way.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.980
Here? No way.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.740
What does that mean?

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.220
That means I can't believe what she's saying.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.800
I don't think it's true and it turns out I misunderstood.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.140
I thought she meant she had been living in that house since 2010

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.960
but she meant she'd been living in the town since then.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.500
Well we've lived here since 2010.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.860
- Here? No way. 
- And it probably started...

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.940
- No. No. No. In North Hampton. Yeah.
- Oh, you mean North Hampton.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.140
-Seven-ish.
-6 or 7 years. Yeah.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.900
I said seven-ish years while Laura said six or seven years.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.380
‘Ish’ is something you might hear put at the end of a word to show approximation.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.580
-Seven-ish.
-6 or 7 years. Yeah.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.940
Every fall I come up to Laura's house and we have a fall baking weekend

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.440
and actually we've made lots of videos from the fall baking weekend

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.640
so I’ll put a link to that playlist in the comments below.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.400
Also right here, just click the I.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.560
They're really fun.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.140
They are. At least we have fun.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.960
We have fun.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.600
We keep on working on the sauce for that pie adding butter and then adding cream.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.740
Okay, are you ready to whisk?

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.140
- I think I’m supposed to add this really slowly.
- Slowly.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.720
Am I supposed to keep on whisking or stirring?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.780
There we're both unsure of what the recipe says.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.560
We both used the phrase ‘supposed to’.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.240
We both reduce this phrase to: spose ta.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.140
We reduced it from 3 syllables to 2.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.940
This is really common.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:09.600
The S and T can either be pronounced: Ss-- sposta, or ZD, spose ta.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.060
- I think I’m supposed to add this really slowly.
- Slowly.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.740
Am I supposed to keep on whisking or stirring?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.480
Alright. Here we go.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.360
- Woah!
- Woah! Steam bomb! The camera!

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.420
Ok, so now we're slicing the apples. We're using machine

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.440
to make it a little easier. You can put them in here then.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.400
Yeah. Okay.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.940
There are always lots of reductions in American English.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.560
Let's look at the ones I just used.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.020
‘We are’ contracts to ‘we're’ and is often pronounced ‘were’ in conversation.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.120
It's really fast and it sounds just like this word: were.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.300
I use that contraction twice here.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.160
So now we're slicing the apples. We're using a machine to make it a little easier. You can put them in here then.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.260
Yeah. Okay.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.740
You're going to put them in here then.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.320
Some more reductions.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.320
The word are at the beginning was dropped.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.240
We need that word to be grammatically correct but it is sometimes dropped in spoken English.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.840
‘Going to’ became ‘gonna’ and the TH was dropped in them.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.840
‘Put them’ becomes: put ‘em— put ‘em—

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.940
No TH and a flap T to connect the two words.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.860
Put ‘em— put ‘em—

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.500
You can put them in here then.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.500
Yeah. Okay.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.360
Right. Watch this do its magic.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.700
Love it. They come out at the bottom. Totally thin slice.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.480
Let's put the lemon juice in.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.480
Let's put the lemon juice in.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.360
The word ‘let's’ is really unclear.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.160
It's very common to drop the beginning and basically just make the TS sound.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.200
Let's put the lemon juice in. Ts- ts- ts-

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.900
That's, its, and what can also make this reduction.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.940
We're just putting the TS sound in front of the next word.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.100
See this video for further examples and explanation.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.260
Let's put the lemon juice in.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.460
And the baby’s up. Let me go get him.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.800
Let me go get him. A couple reductions here.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.700
Let me becomes lemme, and the H is dropped in ‘him’.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.320
Dropping the H in this word is a really common reduction.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.100
When we do this, it sounds just like when we dropped the TH in them.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.600
'Get him' becomes 'get um'.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.640
Just like 'put them' was 'put um'.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:41.320
The flap T links the words and the reduction of ‘them’ and ‘him’ are the exact same sounds, schwa and M.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.620
Get em— put em—

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.640
Let me go get him.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.560
Can you look right there? Say ‘Hi! I just had a nice nap!’

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.120
Can you say ‘Hey everybody!’

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.280
Can you try that?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.460
‘Hey everybody!’ You want to try?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.840
No. Okay.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.240
Can I go ahead and put the apples in there?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.400
Yeah, dump them in.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.380
Dump them in. ‘Them’ is reduced again.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.400
Dump em— dump em— Yeah, dump em in.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.480
I'm going to take you down to daddy.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.840
I'm going to take you down to daddy.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.100
'I'm going to' got reduced.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:26.820
With our most common words and phrases, we tend to do the most dramatic reductions. I’m gonna--

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.120
There's almost an idea of I in front of it but not really.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.420
I’m gonna-- I’m gonna-- I’m gonna-- I'm gonna take you down to daddy.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.920
I made a video where I go over this reduction and more examples.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.500
Click here or in the description below to see that video.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.860
I'm going to take you down to daddy.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.420
Alright.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.660
- All of them?
- Let me read ahead.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.680
Yeah, all of them.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.600
I love how when you start paying attention to a particular reduction, you constantly hear it.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.660
Did you catch the reductions of ‘them’ here?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.880
We're talking about the apple slices.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.060
- All of them?
- Let me read ahead.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.340
Yeah, all of them.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.840
All of them. Nice ‘them’ reduction, Laura.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.260
- All of them?
- Mm-hmm.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.480
I like it.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.680
Okay.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.280
Then we mixed the apples in with the other dry ingredients.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.540
We packed the apples into our pie shell and drizzled on the caramel sauce which got too thick as it cooled.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.340
We overcooked it and finally we make the lattice top for the pie.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.500
I had some problems and I kept messing it up.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.160
What is wrong with me?

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.260
I’m like really screwing up.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.840
Really screwing up.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.220
Screw up is a phrasal verb which means to do something the wrong way

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.740
or to do a bad job with something.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.920
I screwed up the pie crust.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.000
You could also say mess up.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.340
I messed up the pie crust.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.680
I’m really screwing up. I have to wipe that out.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.680
Oh darn. I I have to eat that caramel sauce.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.760
This is weird, Laura. Last time I made this, it seeped in much more.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.480
So when... because look when I'm doing the lattice now, when I pull it up, it's like bringing up all this goo.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.240
- It’s thicker. 
- It's weird.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.480
I gotta say right now I'm like, I'm feeling embarrassed about how this is turning out.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.160
Turn out. Another phrasal verb.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.860
As I'm using it here, it means how something develops or ends.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:31.300
I'm not happy with how it's going, I'm embarrassed with the end result of my pie.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.220
I got to say, right now, I'm like, I'm feeling embarrassed about how this is turning out.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:43.400
I finished making the top and we put it in the oven and the final scene of course needs to be trying the pie.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.760
It’s out of the oven, looking good. Laura, how are you feeling about it?

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.700
I’m feeling great!

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.900
Oh, also we made a pumpkin pie.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.180
I’m also feeling great about that.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.700
From scratch with a pumpkin.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.860
We made whipped cream. Big deal.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.760
And Dana made chocolate-dipped macaroons.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.300
Macaroon or Macaron?

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.300
To clarify, this is a macaroon and this is a macaron,

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.940
which is also pronounced ‘macaroon’.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.260
I don’t know, I’ll look it up and I’ll let everyone know. 
Okay, let’s cut this pie. Who wants a little bit of apple?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.720
If you'd like to recreate this pie, it really is amazingly delicious.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.660
Please see the link in the video description below.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.820
It's from my favorite pie book, the Four and Twenty Blackbirds book.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.080
I’m going to have a caramely taste.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.340
It turned out well.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:39.000
That’s it guys, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English!
