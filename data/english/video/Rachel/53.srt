00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.380
In this American English pronunciation video,
you're going to join me at my friend's wedding

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.670
on a beautiful farm, and study the pronunciation
of the word 'wedding' and other two-syllable words.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.740
Today I'm at the wedding of one of my very
best friends. Her name is Laura, and you have

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.860
seen her previously in the video where we
made a pumpkin pie. The word 'wedding'. It's

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.449
a two-syllable word, so we have one stressed,
and one unstressed syllable. The word begins

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.300
with the W consonant sound, so the lips will
come into a tight circle for that. Then the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.980
jaw has to drop a good bit for that EH as
in BED vowel. We-, we-. Then we have the D

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.079
consonant sound opening up into the ING. Now,
that's the unstressed syllable, so it's going

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.499
to be lower in pitch, pretty quick: -ding,
-ding, -ding. So, the tongue tip starts here

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.640
for the D, quickly comes down for the IH,
and then the back of the tongue makes contact

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.070
here for the NG. Make sure the tip of the
tongue does not come back up, that would be

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.479
an N ending. Common mistake. We want the NG
back here. Wedding wedding.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.289
Every 2-syllable word in American English
will have one stressed and one unstressed

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.090
syllable. So, one will be longer and have
shape in the voice, and the other will be

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.520
short and flat, and low in pitch. To make
both syllables the same length is not correct

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
and ignores the rhythmic structure of American
English. Speaking with an American rhythm

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.840
is key to sounding natural. Wedding. There
I've made both syllables the same length,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.090
and all the sounds are correct---wedding---even
so, it will not sound right because it does

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.939
not have the correct rhythmic structure of
one long and one short syllable. Wedding.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.509
Long-short. Wedding. Let's study more two-syllable
words.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.509
Today I'm at the wedding of one of my very
best friends. Her name is Laura, and you have

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.120
seen her previously in the video where we
made a pumpkin pie.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.040
Here, we have several 2-syllable words. Today.
Stress on the second syllable, so the first

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.760
must be very short. To-, to-, to-day, -day,
today. Listen again.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.460
Today I'm at the wedding... [3x]

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.060
Today I'm at the wedding
of one of my very best friends.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.060
Very: stress on the first syllable. So, the
second syllable is very short 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:55.830
and flat: -y, -y, -y, ver-y, ver-y, very,
very. Listen again.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:06.830
...of one of my very best friends. [3x]

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.400
...of one of my very best friends.
Her name is Laura.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:19.000
Laura, stress on the first syllable.  
Laur-a, Laur-a, Laura.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.900
Her name is Laura. [3x]

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.489
Her name is Laura, and you have seen her previously
in the video where we made a pumpkin pie.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:43.009
Pumpkin. Stress on the first syllable. Pump-kin,
pump-kin. Pumpkin, pumpkin. Listen again.

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:49.849
A pumpkin pie. [3x]

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.020
So this is my good friend Liz, also here for
the wedding. Hey Liz!

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.000
&gt;&gt; Hi, hi, hi friends.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.659
Also: stress on the first syllable. Al-so,
al-so, also, also.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.450
Also here for the wedding. [3x]

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.750
...also here for the wedding. Hey Liz!
&gt;&gt; Hi, hi, hi friends.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.019
&gt;&gt; Liz came in from Pittsburgh.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:23.030
Pittsburgh, a great city in Pennsylvania.
Stress is, again, on the first syllable. Pitts-burgh,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.340
Pitts-burgh. Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.320
&gt;&gt; ...came in from Pittsburgh. [3x]

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.560
&gt;&gt; ...came in from Pittsburgh. Now, Liz, tell
me how you know Laura.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.690
&gt;&gt; Um, Laura is a college friend of mine.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:53.080
College: stress is on the first syllable.
Coll-ege, coll-ege, college, college.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.810
&gt;&gt; Is a college friend of mine. [3x]

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.290
&gt;&gt; Laura is a college friend of mine, so I
met her freshman year, first year of college,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.669
when I met you, as well.

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:21.039
Freshman, stress on the first syllable. Fresh-man,
fresh-man. Freshman.

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:29.290
&gt;&gt; Freshman year, first year... [3x]

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.310
&gt;&gt; Freshman year, first year of college, when
I met you, as well.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.830
&gt;&gt; Right, but didn't you meet her because
of a specific activity?

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.669
&gt;&gt; Yes. Laura and I played tennis together.

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:53.590
Tennis. Stress on the first syllable. Ten-nis,
ten-nis, tennis, tennis.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:01.260
&gt;&gt; Laura and I played tennis together. [3x]

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.180
&gt;&gt; Laura and I played tennis together.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.650
&gt;&gt; Yes we did. Um, and, uh, were we doubles
partners? I don't think we were ever doubles

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.720
partners.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:17.620
'Doubles' and 'partners'. In both of these
words, stress is on the first syllable. Dou-bles,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:28.240
dou-bles, doubles. Partners. Part-ners, part-ners.
Partners. Doubles partners.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.090
&gt;&gt; Doubles partners. [3x]

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.610
&gt;&gt; Weddings are good for holding babies.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:47.229
Holding and babies. Again, first syllables
are stressed in both of these words. Hold-ing,

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:54.810
hold-ing, bab-ies, bab-ies, holding babies.
Listen again.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:02.159
&gt;&gt; ...for holding babies. [3x]

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:08.780
&gt;&gt; This is brother-in-law of the bride. What
do you have on your plate there?

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.869
&gt;&gt; Peach pie and vanilla ice cream.
&gt;&gt; That sounds delicious. How is it?

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:19.059
&gt;&gt; It's, it's delicious, it's a wonderful
combination, complements each other ...

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:22.409
&gt;&gt; Just like Laura and Mark.
&gt;&gt; Just like Laura and Mark.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.520
&gt;&gt; There we go.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.460
Speaking of Laura and Mark, traditionally
at weddings, the bride and groom will have

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.169
a first dance alone together.

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:39.169
&gt;&gt; Well, guys, thanks so much for letting
me use my video camera here at your wedding,

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:47.019
and sharing your special day, document it
for the Rachel's English community!

00:07:47.019 --> 00:08:01.479
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
