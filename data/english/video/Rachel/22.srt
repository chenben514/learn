In this American English Pronunciation video,
we’re going to go over the idiom ‘on the

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.980
back burner’ to learn its meaning and pronunciation.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.640
Just today I was writing an email to a business
contact. I said: My bookkeeping project has

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.419
been moved to the back burner for the time
being.

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.839
What is the literal meaning of this?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.160
This is a stove. It has four burners. And
this is the back burner, here and here. Now,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.670
what’s in this pot isn’t that important
right now. It doesn’t need much attention.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.039
So I’m just going to move it to the back
burner. There we go. I have literally moved

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.720
it to the back burner.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.239
That’s the literal meaning of ‘back burner’.
But the phrase ‘back burner’ is used more

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.030
commonly as an idiom. You move something to
the back burner when something else comes

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.340
up that has become more important. It doesn’t
mean you’re not going to work on it, it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.970
just means you’re not going to work on it
right now or very much.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.020
You may hear ‘back burner’ with the verb
‘move’ or ‘put’. Let’s put that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.340
on the back burner. Or simply ‘on’.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.670
Let’s look at a few more examples of how
to use this idiom before we discuss how to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.020
pronounce it.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.960
Yeah, I have a lot going on. I should put
some things on the back burner, but, I don’t

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.300
really want to.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.540
&gt;&gt; I had, just a big event at my work, and
so now I’ve got a lot on my plate to try

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.470
to deal with the post-event stuff as well
as things that I had put on the back burner

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.680
while I was working on the event.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.270
Back burner. ‘Back’ is the most stressed
syllable here. Baa-. It has a clear AA as

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.700
in BAT vowel. Lift your tongue in the back,
aa, and lift your upper lip just a little

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:13.460
bit. Ba-. Back burner. We have a very soft
K sound before the B. Back, kk, kk, kk. The

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:22.710
tongue goes up to the soft palate and releases,
kk. It’s not strong, KK, but pretty soft,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.870
kk, kk. Back, back, back burner.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.890
‘Burner’ is a two-syllable word with stress
on the first syllable. But it’s not as stressed

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.560
as the word ‘back’. Let’s take some
of the energy out of the voice to give contrast

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.569
to ‘back’. Back burner, burner, burner.
Back burner. Since the first syllable won’t

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.480
be too stressed, we can make the first and
last syllables sound the same, ur, ur, with

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:09.620
a quick flip of the tongue for the N, -urner,
-ner. UR, this vowel is a lot like the R consonant:

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:19.790
flare the lips, and pull the tongue tip back
and up, ur, ur. This part of the tongue can

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.000
be either touching the roof of the mouth or
the inside or bottom of the side teeth here,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.840
urr. And the tongue tip doesn’t touch anything.
Urrrrnerrr. So the tongue just flaps up quickly

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:48.130
for the N -urner, then right back down into
position for the UR again. This time, even

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:58.200
less energy is in the voice. Let the pitch
go down, -ner, -er. This will give us the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:09.130
right sound. -Urner, -urner. Burner, back
burner. Back burner.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.280
Let’s look at the examples one more time.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.219
Yeah, I have a lot going on. I should put
some things on the back burner, but, I don’t

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:19.169
really want to.

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.789
&gt;&gt; I had, just a big event at my work, and
so now I’ve got a lot on my plate to try

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.710
to deal with the post-event stuff as well
as things that I had put on the back burner

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.870
while I was working on the event.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.870
