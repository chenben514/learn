00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.710
In this American English pronunciation video,
you're going to learn a little bit about one

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:14.759
of America's 50 States. Can you guess which
state this is? A rocky coast, and very cold

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.759
Atlantic water! Also, beautiful pines.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.910
This is Maine. Maine is at the very top of
the east coast of the United States. Its pronunciation

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.860
is quite straight forward. The M consonant,
the AY as in SAY diphthong, do drop your jaw

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.470
for the first sound of that diphthong ... and
a final N, Maine. Some of my students who

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.370
are Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin speakers,
among others, have difficulty with an ending

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.580
N. The tongue should be relaxed and flat,
very forward, with the tip lifted so the the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.510
front part is at the roof of the mouth. Maine,
Maine.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.580
I spent six days this summer at Acadia National
Park on Mount Desert Island, just off the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.580
coast. While camping in Acadia, we enjoyed
exploring the coast and some beautiful hikes.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.810
&gt;&gt; So foggy!
&gt;&gt; Looks like someone left their lobster cage.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.990
Makes me want to have lobster for dinner.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.520
Did you notice? Both 'lobster' and 'foggy'
are spelled with the letter O, and they're

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.520
making the AH as in FATHER sound. Look at how much
my jaw drops for those sounds. Foggy, lobster.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.690
Another word with the O that has the AH as
in FATHER vowel, rock. And, dog.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.280
That was not planned. I don't even know whose
dog that is.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.810
Another word where the letter O spells the
AH as in FATHER vowel is 'moss'. And I'm noticing,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.450
moss is all over the place here on the coast
of Maine, I guess because it's so damp. But

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.819
this is an example of moss.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.719
I'm spending most of my time here on the coast
of Maine. The capital of Maine is Augusta,

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.579
and that's inland. Let's take a second to
look at the word 'inland'. It looks like it

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:37.099
should be in-land. But actually, there's a
schwa in that second syllable. It's unstressed,

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.849
and in this particular case, we do reduce
the vowel. Inland, inland. This is just like

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:49.269
island, island, where again, we have a schwa
in that second, unstressed syllable. Also

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:56.579
notice, the S is silent in that word. Island,
inland. Now, let's take a look at the pronunciation

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.599
of 'Augusta'.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.349
Augusta. This is a three-syllable word with
stress on the middle syllable. da-DA-da. The

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.489
first syllable, unstressed, can be either
the AW as in LAW vowel, or the schwa. The

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.169
second, stressed syllable, begins with the
G consonant, has the UH as in BUTTER vowel,

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:28.409
Augu-, and the ST consonant cluster followed
by the schwa, -sta, -sta. Augusta, Augusta.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:35.409
You can't come to Maine without trying its
seafood, like this New England Clam Chowder.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.559
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:46.359
Or this lobster roll, where lobster meat is
mixed in with other ingredients to make a

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:53.279
salad and served on a roll. Maine is also
known for its blueberries, so don't miss blueberry

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.819
pie if you visit.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.569
I loved Maine and its slippery coast. Have
you ever been to Maine? If so, tell me about

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.059
it in the comments section, or better yet,
practice speaking and record a video, and

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.540
upload it as a video response to this video
on YouTube.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.540
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's
English.
