00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:08.270
A classic American summer treat: s'mores.
&gt;&gt; Delicious!

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.730
Now, I got this information on the internet,
so I'm not sure how true it is. But I saw

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.769
a couple different sources that said s'mores
came to be in the early 1900s, maybe originated

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.510
by the girl scouts. S'mores comes from the
words some more. It's been shortened -- s'mores.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.720
So, we pronounce this first with the S sound,
ss. Then into the M consonant sound: sm-,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:52.650
sm-. Next can either be the 'aw' as in 'law'
vowel or the 'oh' as in 'no' diphthong, followed

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:02.500
by the R. Smo-, smor-, s'mores. The final
sound is the Z sound.  It's plural here, the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:11.780
S, and it's pronounced as a Z because the
sound before is a voiced sound. S'mores. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:28.229
The ingredients one needs: marshmallows, graham
crackers, and, the key ingredient, chocolate bars. 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:37.369
Did you notice? The word THE occurred
twice in that clip. Once it was pronounced

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.909
with the 'ee' as in 'she' vowel, and once
with the schwa vowel. "The ingredients one

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:52.899
needs ... the key ingredient, chocolate bars."
The rule is: when the next word begins with

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:03.020
a vowel sound, the word THE is pronounced
with the 'ee' as in 'she' vowel, as in, 'the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.060
ingredients.' The, the, the ingredients. When
the next word begins with a consonant sound,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:22.060
it is pronounced with the schwa vowel. The
key, the key, the the. So, the difference: the, the. 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:45.660
The ingredients one needs: marshmallows,
graham crackers, and, the key ingredient, chocolate bars.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.650
We're lucky to have a fire
pit in our back yard. An open flame or hot

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:01.700
coals: key to roasting marshmallows.
&gt;&gt; Hold on, I have a poker! ... Yeah.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.310
First, I like to prep my graham cracker. So,
break it in half. Then, I like to go with

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.280
a whole half of a chocolate bar. Some people
just do three squares, I really need six.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:26.280
And now for the marshmallows. Put them on
the stick, and stick them in the fire.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.250
And now, with the top graham, we squeeze the 
marshmallow so we can pull out the stick. 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.250
Can you see it? 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.860
Now hopefully, if you've done it right,
the marshmallows will start to melt the chocolate. YUM!

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.910
&gt;&gt; It's a very sticky, but delicious, treat.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:20.970
&gt;&gt; It really is. You can't eat this in fine
company. Luckily, I'm not in fine company.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.650
&gt;&gt; You say as you pan to me.
&gt;&gt; You just happened to be next Clara. No offense.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.080
&gt;&gt; This is so good.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.100
&gt;&gt; Is this your first s'more? Ooo, give me
a review, would you? How are you enjoying

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.620
your first s'more experience? Charlotte is
from the Netherlands.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.250
&gt;&gt; It's delicious.
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite part?

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.250
&gt;&gt; The chocolate and the s'more and then the
cookies ...

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.449
&gt;&gt; So basically, everything.
&gt;&gt; That's the joy of s'more.

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.210
&gt;&gt; It is.
&gt;&gt; All of it together.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.590
&gt;&gt; See, sometimes I put the piece of chocolate
in the gr-- in the marshmallow, and then I

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.530
stick that in the fire. But you have to be
careful ...

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.600
&gt;&gt; How does that not fall off?
&gt;&gt; Well, if you spear the stick through the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.560
marshmallow and the chocolate, and make sure
the chocolate is deeply embedded inside the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.990
marshmallow ...
&gt;&gt; Can you show me this technique?

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.200
&gt;&gt; I can ... ok. So I split the marshmallow.
It is a bit sticky.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.580
&gt;&gt; I'm having problems focusing because it's
so ...

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.720
&gt;&gt; It is rather dark.
&gt;&gt; ... low in the light.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.910
&gt;&gt; And then, I'll put the piece of chocolate
right in there. Maybe double it up. Try to

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:38.370
close this up a little bit. And then, spear
it right through with the stick. And then,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.370
you just have to roast it while keeping the
chocolate end up so it doesn't melt or fall out.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.410
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.380
&gt;&gt; So Lindsay, tell me about your variation.
&gt;&gt; That you put, instead of a chocolate -- slab

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.210
of chocolate, which is delicious, but you
can also make it with a Reese's peanut butter

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.949
cup. And it's peanut buttery and chocolaty.
&gt;&gt; And chocolaty. That sounds really good.

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.650
&gt;&gt; It's really really good.
&gt;&gt; So who gets the peanut butter?

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.350
&gt;&gt; Charlotte, did you put peanut butter on
that? Wow. Ok. I want to, I want you to taste

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.880
this and let me know how it is.
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.880
&gt;&gt; What do you think? Better with or without
peanut butter?

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.410
&gt;&gt; It's interesting. You really have to love
chocolate and peanut butter together.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.229
&gt;&gt; Do you?
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:44.000
&gt;&gt; So is this better than without peanut butter?
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say it's better. &gt;&gt; Just different.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.610
&gt;&gt; Just different.  But also very good.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.150
That's it, and thanks so much for using Rachel's English.
