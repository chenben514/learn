00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:01.419
Hey guys!

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.555
Here with my friend Laura in Massachusetts,

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:05.546
and we're going to make bagels.

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:07.245
A very New York thing.

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:08.916
And, as you know, I live in New York,

00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:10.527
but I've never made these before.

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:11.328
So this video

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:13.785
 isn't actually about making bagels,

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.896
it's about American English pronunciation.

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:23.620
 

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:25.030
&gt;&gt; And, will you just confirm

00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:27.292
that this is accurate? Just by reading it.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.983
So I'm going to put four and a half teaspoons

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:30.767
of yeast in, right?

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:33.984
&gt;&gt; Yes, that is correct.

00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:35.723
Let's take a look at a T

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:38.136
in an ending consonant cluster.

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:41.136
In the phrase 'just confirm',

00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:42.939
the T was dropped.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.134
In the phrase 'just by', the T was dropped.

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:50.995
In the phrase 'yeast in', we heard the T.

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:53.942
We also heard the T in the word 'correct'.

00:00:53.943 --> 00:00:55.822
What's going on here?

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:59.148
If the T comes between two consonant sounds,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.982
like it did in the first two phrases,

00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:04.924
native speakers will often drop the T.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:07.273
This is true of the D sound as well.

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:14.799
Just confirm, just by, yeast in, correct.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.324
Let's listen again.

00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:19.999
&gt;&gt; And, will you just confirm

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.443
that this is accurate?

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:23.408
Just by reading it.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.114
So I'm going to put four and a half teaspoons

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:28.282
of yeast in, right?

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:34.129
&gt;&gt; Yes, that is correct.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.756
&gt;&gt; And then we need the sugar.

00:01:36.757 --> 00:01:37.725
Which we already decided

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:39.733
was two and a half teaspoons.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.519
Did you notice that I dropped the L sound

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.805
in the word 'already'.  Aaaw-ready.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.612
I just used the vowel.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.256
I've noticed that I and other native speakers

00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:53.768
do this with 'already' and 'alright'.

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:55.364
Listen to a few more cases

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:56.975
from our baking day.

00:01:56.976 --> 00:01:59.571
&gt;&gt; Which we already decided

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:01.488
was two and a half teaspoons.

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:03.092
 

00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:07.041
&gt;&gt;  Alright.

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:10.192
 

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:12.094
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:14.146
 

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:16.805
&gt;&gt; Alright, four more.

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:19.142
&gt;&gt; We need to add two cups of flour.

00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:21.460
'Flour' is a homophone.

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:23.047
We bake with flour,

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:26.359
but a flower grows on a tree or a bush.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.816
&gt;&gt; We need to add two cups of flour.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:31.776
And I bought just the perfect amount of flour.

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:34.361
'Just the'.  Did you notice?

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.821
The T was dropped in 'just'

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:40.319
because the next sound was a consonant.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.135
&gt;&gt; And I bought just

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:44.597
the perfect amount of flour.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:45.844
&gt;&gt; So this needs to be three minutes.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:46.503
Do we need to be …

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:48.225
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.  Let that stand for three minutes.

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:49.876
And I took the clock out of the room

00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:51.796
because it was so freaking loud.

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:53.647
 

00:02:53.648 --> 00:02:54.726
&gt;&gt; Don't you have a watch on?

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:55.718
Did you notice that

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.263
Laura dropped the H in 'have'?

00:02:58.264 --> 00:03:00.041
This is a common reduction.

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:02.093
Dropping the H in function words

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:05.896
'have', 'had', 'her', 'his'.

00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:07.483
You have a, you have a.

00:03:07.484 --> 00:03:08.821
Don't you have a watch on?

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:13.266
&gt;&gt; Don't you have a watch on?

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:16.664
&gt;&gt; No, but my iPad says…

00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:17.363
&gt;&gt; It does say,

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.243
"Add additional flour if needed."

00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:20.577
I'm saying, I need it.

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:22.555
&gt;&gt; Do you want me to get some regular flour?

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:23.244
&gt;&gt; I got it right here.

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:25.483
&gt;&gt; Ok. Yeah. It seems that you do need it.

00:03:25.484 --> 00:03:26.467
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:26.484 --> 00:03:28.492
&gt;&gt; And I don't mean 'knead it'.

00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:29.810
&gt;&gt; No, you mean the other 'need'!

00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:30.619
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.053
Another homophone.  'Need' and 'knead'.

00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:37.891
Different spellings, different meanings,

00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:40.241
but pronounced the same.

00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:41.717
&gt;&gt; I'm saying, I need it.

00:03:41.718 --> 00:03:49.620
&gt;&gt; We're going to knead it. [3x]

00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:52.354
&gt;&gt; So, the bagels rested.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:56.915
Quietly, they were behaving very well.

00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:57.582
For four minutes,

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:59.622
and now we're making the hole.

00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:00.909
For four.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.718
Did you hear how I reduced

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.033
the function word 'for' to 'fer',

00:04:06.034 --> 00:04:09.961
but I did not reduce the content word 'four',

00:04:09.962 --> 00:04:10.984
for four.

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:14.295
&gt;&gt; For four minutes,

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.779
and now we're making the hole.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.902
&gt;&gt; Ok.  Where are your hot pads?

00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:19.537
&gt;&gt; Third drawer down.

00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:21.037
Where are your.

00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:24.021
That's a lot of schwa/R sounds.

00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:29.879
I reduced 'are' to 'er', and 'your' to 'yer'.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.419
But I still made it sound like

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.170
three different syllables by reemphasizing

00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:36.742
the R sound for the second syllable.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:41.608
Where are, where are, where are,

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:44.303
where are your, where are your.

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:49.042
&gt;&gt; Where are your hot pads?

00:04:49.043 --> 00:04:51.182
&gt;&gt; Third drawer down.

00:04:51.183 --> 00:04:54.593
&gt;&gt; We are taking an egg white,

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.227
separated from the yolk.

00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:58.061
Another homophone.

00:04:58.062 --> 00:05:00.045
'Yolk', with the letter L, is the yellow,

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:02.219
is the yellow, middle part of an egg.

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.217
The other yoke is this.

00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:06.455
Something you can use to attach animals

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:09.273
to a cart or something similar.

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:10.988
&gt;&gt; …separated from the yolk,

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:13.845
and brushing it on the bagels.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:18.783
Because not only does it give it a shine,

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:21.082
but if you want to add some toppings to it,

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:22.740
like onion flakes,

00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:24.798
you can do that and it sticks that way.

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:26.289
Because it's kind of sticky.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.495
Just like most sentences

00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:30.520
in conversational American English,

00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:32.766
there were a lot of reductions there.

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:36.188
'Want to' became 'wanna'.  If you wanna add.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.561
'Can' was reduced to 'kn'.  You can do that.

00:05:40.562 --> 00:05:44.773
'Because' was reduced to 'cuz'.  Cuz it's.

00:05:44.774 --> 00:05:48.579
We contracted 'it is' to 'it's', cuz it's.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.069
'Kind of' became 'kinda'.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.370
&gt;&gt; But if you want to add some toppings to it,

00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:58.071
like onion flakes,

00:05:58.072 --> 00:06:02.483
you can do that and it sticks that way.

00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:08.180
Because it's kind of sticky.

00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.454
I had a lot of fun making these bagels,

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:13.676
and making this pronunciation lesson for you.

00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:16.173
What do you want to see me bake next?

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:19.122
Let me know in the comments below.

00:06:19.123 --> 00:06:22.679
That's it, and thanks so much for watching

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.052
Rachel's English.

00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:26.787
&gt;&gt; Close.  It's 'using' Rachel's English,

00:06:26.788 --> 00:06:27.200
but that's good.

00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.271
&gt;&gt; Oh.
