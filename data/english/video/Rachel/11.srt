You guys love Ben Franklin videos.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.960
They're one of the best ways for you to improve listening comprehension and learn tricks to sound more natural

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.560
when speaking English, like using specific reductions.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.160
This January, you're getting five all new Ben Franklin videos

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.040
where we do a full analysis of real American English conversations.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.940
Today's topic, dinner at a friend's house.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.760
Let's get started with this analysis. First, the whole conversation.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.960
The sauce is on the table. So we’ve got eggs and the rice.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.420
And usually the som tum would, would have sticky rice with it,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.060
but I couldn’t quite imagine eating this, with, without this kind of rice.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.920
So I, we just went with it. Fluffy jasmine.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.960
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200
It’s definitely on point.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.460
Now, the analysis.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.620
The sauce is on the table. So we’ve got eggs and the rice.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.400
The sauce is on the table.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.860
What do you think are the two most stressed words there?

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.400
I hear ‘sauce’ and ‘table’.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.560
The stressed syllable of ‘table’.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.394
The sauce is on the table.  The sauce is on the table.  The sauce is on the table.

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:22.800
The other word just said very quickly. The word 'the' pronounced with the schwa:

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.260
the— the— the— the— the—

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.120
Said really quickly, low in pitch, less clear. It's not ‘the’ but: the— the— the—

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.860
This is how we pronounce function words in conversation.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.680
The less important words.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.520
This provides contrast with the stress words

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.900
which we want to be clear and longer and have an up-down shape of stress intonation in the voice.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.560
The sauce— the sauce— is on the— is on the—

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.640
The sauce is on the table. The sauce is on the table. The sauce is on the table.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.200
These three words linked together very quickly.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.120
The ending Z sound links into the vowel: is— is on the—

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.260
the N consonant goes right into the TH sound with no break,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.060
and again the word ‘the’ pronounced with the schwa very quickly.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.320
Is on the— is on the— is on the—

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.360
So it's not: is on the— all of those are stressed and that's not right,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.760
but it's: is on the— is on the— is on the— is on the—

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.420
A little mumbled, a little bit less clear, because they are function words.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.860
‘Sauce’ and ‘table’, the two content words, are longer.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.860
And all of the words and all of the sounds flow together smoothly with no jumps and pitch and no choppiness.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.280
The sauce is on the table.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.180
The sauce is on the table. The sauce is on the table. The sauce is on the table.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.020
So we’ve got eggs and the rice.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.400
So we’ve got eggs and the rice.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.980
Okay, what is the most stressed there?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.680
'Eggs’ and ‘rice’.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.100
Both longer than the rest of the words.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.920
So we've got the— So we've got the—

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.060
So we've got the— So we've got the— So we've got the—

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.500
So we've got the— So we've got the— So we've got the—

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.040
The vowel here is almost dropped, it's almost like we're just linking the S sound in.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.680
So we've got the— so we've  got the— so we've got the—

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.800
That helps to say this word more quickly in this string of words that are said so quickly.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.620
So you've got the very quick V sound before the G

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.600
then we have a stop T.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.580
So we don't say: got the— got the—

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.020
with a true T, but we say: got the— got the— got the—

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.060
where we stop the air really quickly in the throat.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.740
This symbolizes the stop T.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.440
The word ‘the’ here she pronounces it with the schwa.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.360
The rule is that if the next word begins with a vowel sound, like this word,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.600
that the E in 'the' is pronounced as the EE as in She sound. The— the— the—

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.760
But I’ve noticed that this is not a rule that Americans necessarily follow all the time.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.660
The— the— the eggs— the eggs—

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.600
She says it with the schwa. It still sounds normal.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.440
Nobody would hear that and think she mispronounced 'the'.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.620
Eggs— Eggs— Eggs and the rice—

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.740
And the rice— and the rice—

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.300
‘And’ and ‘the’ between the two content words, we have two more function words which will be said more quickly.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.320
The word ‘and’ is reduced: and the— and the— and the—

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.320
We drop the vowel, put it into the schwa vowel instead.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.520
We drop the D altogether.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.320
So schwa N. You don't need to try to make a schwa sound.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.420
It just gets absorbed by the N. Just make the N.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.940
Eggs and the— eggs and— eggs and— eggs and the rice— and the rice—

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.160
And the— and the— and the— and the— and the—

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.880
eggs and the rice— eggs and the rice— eggs and the rice—

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.380
Making this reduction helps us say this word really quickly and we want to do that because it's not

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.280
an important word, it's a function word. Those are less important.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.060
The more important words are the content words

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.960
and we want the stressed syllable of the content words to be longer.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.560
For example: rice— and the rice—

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.160
and the— and the— and the—

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.420
Those two words said much more faster than ‘rice’

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.300
where we take a little bit more time and we have the up-down shape of stress.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.400
And the rice—

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.320
And the rice—  And the rice—  And the rice—

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.620
And usually the som tum would, would have sticky rice with it.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.020
And usually— So here, she doesn't reduce the vowel. She keeps the full vowel but she does drop the D.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.400
We almost never say the D unless we’re thinking or holding out the word 'and' for some reason.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.960
Usually— us—

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.920
The stressed syllable there.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.080
Usually the som tum would—

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.180
is the most stressed syllable of the sentence.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.020
And usually—

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.440
usually— usually—  usually—

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.480
Usually— So this word can be pronounced as four syllables: usually—

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.680
or more commonly, three syllables and that's what she does:

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.200
usually— usually— usually— usually—

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.340
Usually-- yoo--

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.060
So the JU as in Few diphthong stressed, usual—

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.920
The djz sound, schwa L, it's just a dark L sound. Usually—

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.280
And the ending IH vowel: usually— usually—

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.820
It's easier to pronounce this word as three syllables than four

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.760
so I suggest that you practice it this way and use this pronunciation: usually—

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.560
usually— usually— usually the som tum would have sticky rice with it.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.460
The som tum— ‘The’ said quickly with the schwa,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.840
then we have a couple words that are a little bit more stressed.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.900
Of course this is not English, this is Thai, she's making a Thai dessert, I'm sorry a Thai salad here.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.140
The word ‘would’, L is always silent.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.220
Usually the som tum would have sticky rice with it—

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.140
would have sticky rice with it—

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.720
would have sticky rice with it—

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.940
So ‘stick’ the most stressed syllable there. Again, there's no L sound in the word ‘would’.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.280
Would have— would have— would have sticky rice with it—

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.380
Would have— would have— would have sticky rice with it—

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.100
A Stop T at the end of ‘it’

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.040
so we stop the air in our throat: it- it- it- it-

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.340
and this abrupt end signifies the T.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.520
Everything in this phrase is smoothly linked together.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.640
The D goes right into the H sound.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.560
She could have dropped to the H but she didn't. Would have— would have—

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.080
The V sounds smoothly right into the ST cluster,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.180
the EE vowel right into the R, the S sound right next to the W.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.400
Rice with— rice with—

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.980
And the ending TH links right into the beginning vowel IH: with it— with it— with it—

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.500
would have a sticky rice with it—

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:09.000
would have a sticky rice with it— would have a sticky rice with it— would have a sticky rice with it—

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.560
But I couldn’t quite imagine eating this—

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.640
But I couldn’t quite imagine eating this—

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.740
‘This’ the most stressed as she is pointing to something.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.880
But I couldn't quite imagine eating this—

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.840
So she puts a little break here between ‘but’ and ‘I’.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.700
If she didn't, she would have flapped the T: but I couldn't— but I— but I couldn't—

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:39.020
Since she doesn't, she puts a break separating these into two thought groups. We have a stop T: but I couldn't—

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.620
but I couldn't—

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:46.060
but I couldn't—  but I couldn't—  but I couldn’t quite imagine eating this

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.520
couldn't quite— couldn't quite—

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.980
You can link the ending N right into the K sound while dropping the T. Couldn't quite— couldn't quite—

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:02.160
Or you can make a little stop in your throat: couldn't quite— couldn't quite— to signify the T there.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.880
Either one is okay, and just like with ‘would’, the L in ‘could’ is silent.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:14.120
Both of these have the UH as in Push vowel. Would— could— couldn't--

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.260
but I couldn’t quite imagine eating this

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.900
but I couldn’t quite imagine eating this

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.960
Quite imagine— quite imagine—  Here we have an ending T sound

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.260
linking into beginning vowel sound

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.140
and because the sound before the T was also a vowel or diphthong, it becomes a flap

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.360
which sounds like the D in American English.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.060
It might sound like the R in your language, depending on the language.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:46.500
Quite imagine— quite— The tongue just flaps once against the roof of the mouth:

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.580
Quite imagine—

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.680
Quite imagine— quite imagine— quite imagine eating this—

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.660
quiet imagine eating—

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.420
Another flap T here, because it comes between two vowel sounds. Eating— eating this--

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.980
Quite imagine eating this—  Quite imagine eating this—   Quite imagine eating this—

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.840
with, without this kind of rice.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.740
with, without--

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.180
So she repeats herself, with,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:18.520
she starts the word without, she pauses while she's thinking, then she says the full word: without— without—

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.920
Stop T at the end because the next word begins with a consonant.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.700
This kind of rice—

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:30.180
‘This’ again, a little bit stressed because we're comparing. This—

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.820
This kind of rice with that kind of rice.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.760
Because it's the word that we're using to compare: this, that, those, these.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.380
It's a little stressed.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.920
This kind of rice.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.000
This kind of rice. This kind of rice. This kind of rice.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.500
kind of rice. kind of rice.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:55.960
The word ‘of’ often pronounced without a consonant but I do hear a light V sound here.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.200
However, the word is said quickly: kind of rice— of- of- of- of-

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.560
It's a function word, it's not as important as the content words like ‘this’ and ‘rice’.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.120
So it's a little bit more mumbled. It’s said very quickly.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.180
Kind of rice.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.300
Kind of rice.  Kind of rice. 
 Kind of rice.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.740
Rice. Rice. Her intonation goes up a little bit at the end because she's going to keep going.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.080
Making the intonation of her voice go up is a signal to us that she's not finished her sentence yet.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.400
Rice.  Rice.  Rice.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.820
So I, we. Just went with it.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.720
So I, we. Just went with it.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.820
So why-- she changes her mind, decides to say something different, we just went with it.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.620
This is the end of her thought and at the end of her thought, her voice trails off a little bit

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.960
and we get a little bit less air in it.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.060
So the last word sounds like this: went with it-- went with it--

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.640
We just went with it. We just went with it. We just went with it.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:59.800
This is called a popcorn quality and it comes in a lot at the ends of phrases in American English.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.420
So we just went with it.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.620
Let's talk about the pronunciation of ‘we just went with it’.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:11.580
We have an ST cluster followed by a consonant. In this case, we almost always drop the T sound. She does.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:17.340
So instead of: just went— It's: just went—  just went—  just went—

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.200
Right from the S sound into the W sound.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.960
We just went with it. We just went with it. We just went with it.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.040
Went. Went with it. Went with it.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:34.200
Stop sound, we have a nasal N sound which we stopped in the throat: went. Went. Went.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.300
That signifies the stop T. With it.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:45.240
Everything links together. T links into the IH vowel and we have another stop T because it's a T at the end of a phrase.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.280
We just went with it.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.860
We just went with it. We just went with it. We just went with it.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:56.840
The phrase ‘to go with something’ means to go ahead with something, with an idea, or with the situation,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.300
even if it's not what you originally imagined.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.420
So she's saying this is not the kind of rice she would usually imagine with this dish,

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.040
but because of another dish, she decided to just go with it.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.020
We just went with it, she says.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.320
We just went with it.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:19.720
It shows flexibility, being able to 'go with the flow', to use another idiom.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.240
So if something comes up that's unplanned or unusual for you,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.200
but you move forward anyway, then you can say: you know what? I'm just going to go with it.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.840
Or in the past tense: I just went with it.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.560
We just went with it. We just went with it. Fluffy jasmine.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.080
Fluffy jasmine.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.980
Now, someone else is talking in the background. It's a little hard to hear, but these are two two-syllable words

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.520
with stress on the first syllable. Fluffy jasmine.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.000
Fluffy jasmine.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.520
All linked together, all part of the same thought group where we have one steady line of intonation, of pitch.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.760
Fluffy jasmine.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.280
Nothing choppy, nothing broken up, this is important in American English.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.140
Fluffy jasmine. Fluffy jasmine. Fluffy jasmine.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.700
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.560
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.180
This is me speaking here behind the camera.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.740
Everything is linked together. Again, we have that smooth intonation.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:25.380
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.780
These are the three most stressed words.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.520
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.140
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.680
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.780
‘What do you’ becomes: wha dya— wha dya— wha dya—

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:42.780
So I drop the T, linked the vowel into the D of ‘do’. Wha dya—

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:50.460
And I've reduced the vowel here to the schwa in all three of these words: what do ya—

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.040
This helps me say them more quickly.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.220
They all link together. What do you—

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.960
What do you— Try that with me. What do you—

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.460
So it's definitely not: What do you—

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.660
That's way too well pronounced.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.580
This is not how we pronounce function words like this.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:15.960
Function words like these need to be lower in pitch, less clear, simplified mouth movements.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.680
What do ya— what do ya— what do ya—

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.040
So that the stressed words pop out of the line more.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:29.280
It is this difference, this contrast between the stressed words which are longer, clearer, louder, higher in pitch,

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.520
against these unstressed words.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.240
It's this contrast that makes American English clear.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.400
What do you think of the food?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.620
What do you think of the food?

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.660
What do you think of the food?

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.440
What do you think of the food?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:46.060
‘Of’ and ‘the’, two more function words together, said very quickly,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:51.220
uh-- just the schwa, I don't pronounce the V sound at all,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.700
‘the’ pronounced with the schwa: othe—
 othe— othe— othe—

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.760
It's not ‘of the’ but: othe—othe— othe—

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.220
This is how we pronounce this in conversation. Of the food—

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.820
What do you think of the food?

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.660
‘Think’ and ‘food’ both being clear and longer.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.820
What do you think of the food?

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.940
What do you think of the food?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.480
What do you think of the food?

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.960
It's definitely on point.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.260
It's definitely on point.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.180
'Def' and 'point'.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.340
Most stressed words there, the word ‘it's’ is reduced, he doesn't really say a vowel,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.840
he just makes the T S sound. It's definitely—

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.540
It's common to do this with the word: it's, that's, what's, and let's.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.380
We just make the TS sound and attach it to the beginning of the next word.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.720
It's definitely—

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.240
It’s definitely on point. It’s definitely on point. It’s definitely on point.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:50.100
definitely—  A little stop T in there: definitely—

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.680
because the next sound is a consonant. Definitely on point.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.220
It’s definitely on point.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.860
On point. And he doesn't really release the T. It's certainly not a true T.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.480
On point. Point— nnnn---

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.320
A nasal N sound, little bit of an abrupt stop,

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.160
that's how we know it's a stop T. On point. On point.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.660
This is an idiom. What does the phrase ‘on point’ mean?

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:23.360
It means perfect, really good, high-quality, excellent,

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.320
and I will say: I have this food and it was delicious.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.880
Let's listen to the whole conversation one more time.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.100
The sauce is on the table. So we’ve got eggs and the rice.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.480
And usually the som tum would, would have sticky rice with it,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.180
but I couldn’t quite imagine eating this, with, without this kind of rice.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.340
So I, we just went with it. Fluffy jasmine.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.160
Ollie, what do you think of the food?

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
It’s definitely on point.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.120
That analysis is really fun and helpful. Right?
