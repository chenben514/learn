00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.490
This video is a bonus video to the one made
last week. There we were studying listening

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.110
comprehension in two-syllable words. In this
video, we’re taking the same footage, but

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.400
we’re studying different things: alright,
the CAN reduction, and the phrasal verb ‘check

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.400
out’, plus a lot more. So stay tuned.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.860
&gt;&gt; So, the space that we’re getting married
in used to be a chocolate factory, about a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.420
century ago.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.010
Did you notice that the letter T in CENTURY
was pronounced CH? As a C-H. Ch. There are

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.370
quite a few common words in American English
where T followed by U is pronounced this way.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:11.370
A few other examples: virtue, future, mature,
mutual, nature, ritual, statue, fortunately.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.090
Century. Listen again.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.189
&gt;&gt; So, the space that we’re getting married
in used to be a chocolate factory, about a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.899
century [3x] ago. And now it’s a photography
studio painted all white, with hardwood floors.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.609
It’s a little industrial, as you can see.
And yeah, this is where we’re gonna do it.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.829
Where we’re gonna get married.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.219
You probably noticed I used ‘gonna’ in
that sentence: this is where we’re gonna

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.119
do it, where we’re gonna get married. It’s
so common, it comes up in almost every real

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.289
life English video. ‘Gonna’ is a great
reduction that will make you sound more American.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:05.439
We use it all the time with the To Be contractions:
I’m, you’re, it’s, and so on. There

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.160
are more ‘gonna’s in this video. Write
them down as you hear them, and watch all

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.140
the way to the end to see if you got them
all.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.820
&gt;&gt; And yeah, this is where we’re gonna do
it. Where we’re gonna get married. So we

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.950
came back today so that we could, sort of,
think about decorations and layout.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.530
Sort of. Did you notice how I used it in that
sentence? What does it mean?

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.770
&gt;&gt; So we came back today so that we could,
sort of, think about decorations and layout.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.160
I used it here as a filler word while I thought
of what to say. It doesn’t really have any

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.130
meaning here. Listen again.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.800
So we came back today so that we could, sort
of, think about decorations and layout.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.400
‘Sort of’ will link together so it sounds
like one word. When we do that, the T in ‘sort’

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:12.430
becomes a flap T, sort of. You’ll also hear
it with no V sound: sorta, sorta.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.100
Americans will also use ‘sort of’ and
‘kind of’ to mean a little bit. For example,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.760
I’m sort of tired. I’m not really tired,
but I’m sort of tired.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.020
Are you hungry? Sort of.
He’s sort of a jerk.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.650
She’s sort of annoying.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.720
&gt;&gt; So we came back today so that we could,
sort of, think about decorations and layout.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.850
So, I think the tables are going to go here.
And the bar is probably going to be somewhere

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.260
else. We are having alcohol at our wedding.
Some people choose not to, although most people

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.350
do. And, we’re getting married and having
the reception all here in this same space.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.060
It used to be really typical to get married
in a church. Less so now. Most of my cousins

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.790
have gotten married outside. A lot of my friends
as well.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.130
A lot of – just like ‘sort of’, this
is a really common phrase, and it all links

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:25.260
together so it sounds like one word. You can
drop the V sound at the end: a lot of, alotta.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.690
Listen again.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.000
&gt;&gt; A lot of [3x] my friends as well. We can’t
do that because it’s going to be January

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.130
in Philadelphia, um, but hopefully this will
be just a lovely! We’re going to have lots

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.060
of candles. Everywhere candles, candles, candles.
And, the chocolate that used to be made in

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.970
this factory, it was the precursor to the
Hershey’s kiss, it’s shaped the same,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.880
it’s called a Wilburbud. And we’re going
to have a lot of those for our guests to enjoy

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.150
as well. Unless we eat them all before the
wedding, which might happen.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.480
&gt;&gt; What else can I say? Actually, that was
an example, a great example of a ‘can’

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.950
reduction.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.990
‘Can’ will reduce when it’s a helping
verb, which is most of the time. It’s not

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.180
CAN, but kn, kn. Listen again.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.520
&gt;&gt; What else can I say?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.750
&gt;&gt; One idea that I had for decorating is,
I bought some hooks that are magnetic, and

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.370
I thought I might be able to put them on the
metal beams and hang little lanterns with

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.370
candles in them. So I’m going to have to
set those up and see if they work. I’m going

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.410
to go get those now.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.520
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.200
Did you notice how I said ‘alright’? I
dropped the L, and made just a quick AW sound

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:04.330
for the first syllable. Aw, aw, alright.  That 
makes it easy to say the syllable really quickly, 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:13.160
which is what we want since it’s unstressed. 
Alright, alright. Listen again.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.449
&gt;&gt; Alright [3x]

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.040
&gt;&gt; Let’s check it out.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.580
Check it out. What does this mean?
The phrasal verb ‘to check out’ has several

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.220
meanings. When you’re leaving a hotel you
go to the front desk and you tell them you’re

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.550
leaving, maybe you pay the bill. This is called
checking out.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.270
&gt;&gt;We need to check out at 11.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.310
It means to go to the cashier to buy things
at a store.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.610
&gt;&gt; Are you done shopping?
&gt;&gt; No, I still need to check out.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:54.090
To be checked out means to not be paying attention.
&gt;&gt; I have no idea what was discussed, I was

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.050
completely checked out during the meeting.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.059
To check something out means to get to know
it or give it a try.

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:07.820
&gt;&gt; Have you been to the new coffee shop?
&gt;&gt; No, I’ll have to check it out soon.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.770
To check something out can also mean to borrow
it.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.990
&gt;&gt; I’m checking this book out of the library.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.480
To check out something can mean 
to verify it’s true.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.169
&gt;&gt; I’ll check out her story before I write
about her.

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:28.440
To check someone out means to have romantic,
or at least physical interest in someone.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.040
&gt;&gt; I think he likes you, I saw him checking
you out.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.070
What did I mean when I said ‘check it out’?
Listen again.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.139
&gt;&gt; Alright. Let’s check it out.

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:49.300
Here I was using the meaning to give it a
try.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:56.300
&gt;&gt; Let’s check it out [3x].

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.780
Alright, let’s check it out.  

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.100
Now that’s going to be fun, right? All up
and down with a little tea light in it? I

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.820
love it. That’s going to be fun.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.979
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:23.360
Another alright. Again, no L. A-, a-, a-,
alright.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.950
&gt;&gt; Alright. [3x]

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.070
&gt;&gt; I think the tables are gonna go here.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.769
&gt;&gt; And the bar is probably going to be somewhere
else.

00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:50.950
&gt;&gt; We’re gonna have lots of candles.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:57.030
&gt;&gt; And we’re gonna have a lot of those for
our guests to enjoy as well.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.550
&gt;&gt; So I’m gonna have to set those up and
see if they work.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.260
&gt;&gt; I’m gonna go get those now.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.420
&gt;&gt; Now that’s gonna be fun, right?

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.410
&gt;&gt; That’s gonna be fun.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:22.680
Even with just a few phrases of American English,
there’s a lot to learn. Thanks for studying

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.830
with me.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:30.830
&gt;&gt; Alright guys, that’s it. And thanks so
much for using Rachel’s English.
