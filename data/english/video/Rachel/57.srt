00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.370
I often talk about the use of reductions in
everyday, casual conversation. In this American

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.410
English pronunciation video, we're going to
take a look at reductions in a more formal

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.980
setting: important speeches.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.880
Yesterday, Barack Obama was reelected as the
President of the United States. We're going

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.649
to take a look at both his speech, and his
opponent, Mitt Romney's speech, delivered

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.750
at the end of the evening.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.140
First, the word 'wanna'. Both men used this
reduction in their speeches. 'Wanna' is a

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:54.969
reduction of the words 'want to'. Wanna, wanna.
It has the UH as in BUTTER vowel in the stressed

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.780
syllable, and the schwa in the unstressed
syllable. Here are 'wanna' examples from the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.309
speeches.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.650
&gt;&gt; I wanna thank every American who participated
in this election.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.970
&gt;&gt; I wanna thank Paul Ryan for all that he
has done for our campaign.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.110
&gt;&gt; I also wanna thank Ann.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.830
I wanna, I wanna. Listen to these clips again,
repeat in the pause.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.830
&gt;&gt; I wanna thank every American. [3x]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
&gt;&gt; I wanna thank Paul Ryan. [3x]

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.030
&gt;&gt; I also wanna thank Ann. [3x]

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.350
The reduction of the word 'to' was also frequently
used. 'To' can either be reduced to 'to',

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.350
with the True T, schwa sound, or 'to', with
the Flap T/schwa sound. Let's see some examples.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.390
&gt;&gt; The best is yet to come.
&gt;&gt; By the way, we have to fix that.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.519
&gt;&gt; To the best campaign team.
&gt;&gt; Just for a chance to argue.

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.150
&gt;&gt; To the furniture worker's child in North
Carolina.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.640
&gt;&gt; And his commitment to principle will continue
to contribute to the good of our nation.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.300
To, to, listen to these clips again.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.469
&gt;&gt; The best is yet to come. [3x]

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:43.469
&gt;&gt; we have to fix that. [3x]

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:58.269
&gt;&gt; To the best campaign team. [3x]

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.029
&gt;&gt; to argue. [3x]

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:18.170
&gt;&gt; To the furniture worker's child [3x]

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:36.170
&gt;&gt; And his commitment to principle [3x] will
continue to contribute [3x]

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:47.069
Also, both men reduced the word 'have' to
simply the schwa sound, uh. Mr. Obama said

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:59.110
'may-uh' for 'may have', and Mr. Romney said
'would-uh' for 'would have'

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.110
&gt;&gt; We may have battled fiercely
&gt;&gt; She would have been a wonderful first lady

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:10.389
May have, may have, would have, would have.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:18.709
&gt;&gt; We may have battled fiercely [3x]

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:29.049
&gt;&gt; She would have been a wonderful first lady
[3x]

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.789
There were lots of other reductions in these
speeches. For example, reducing 'for' to 'fer'

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:43.569
&gt;&gt; But for the United States of America
&gt;&gt; I thank my sons for their tireless work.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.849
Reducing 'can' to 'kun'.

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.500
&gt;&gt; That's what politics can be.
&gt;&gt; That can compare with what you've done.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.600
And use of contractions:

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.280
&gt;&gt; And you've made me a better President.
&gt;&gt; Because I'm concerned about America.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.090
Watch the speeches in full and study them.
What reductions do you notice?

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.980
That's it, and thanks so much
for using Rachel's English.
