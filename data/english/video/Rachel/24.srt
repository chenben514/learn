In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going
to talk about the cultural use of hugging.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.000
There’s something I’ve been wanting to make
a video about for a while, and that’s hugging.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:25.240
It’s mostly because I think it must be weird
for non-Americans; sometimes it’s even weird

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.529
for me. If you’ve spent much time in the
US, you might have noticed that Americans

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.230
hug each other a lot. We do it in saying hello
to someone and in saying good bye.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.180
You don’t do this with someone you’ve
never met when meeting, in that case you

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.840
probably do a hand shake.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.060
&gt;&gt; Hey Hilah, this is my boyfriend David.
&gt;&gt; Hi David.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.569
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; I’m Hilah.

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:52.710
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet…

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.270
Also, you don’t hug in business settings.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.819
&gt;&gt; Hello, Ms. Smith. I’m Tom Kelley. Thanks
so much for coming in.

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:01.530
&gt;&gt; It’s my pleasure. Thanks so much for
meeting with me.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.259
In business settings, you shake hands when
meeting or leaving someone, unless it’s

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.970
more causal, like someone you see every day
at your office. Then you can just say ‘hello’

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.310
or ‘good-bye’.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.259
&gt;&gt; Morning Tom.
&gt;&gt; Hey. Morning, Rach.

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.159
But when it’s a friend, you hug when you
meet up or part ways with them.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.680
&gt;&gt; Hey!
&gt;&gt; How ya feeling?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.420
&gt;&gt; Long time no see.
&gt;&gt; It’s good to see ya.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.540
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.340
&gt;&gt; How are ya?
&gt;&gt; Good. How are you?

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.620
&gt;&gt; Good. Thanks for having us.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.560
&gt;&gt; Hey Rick!
&gt;&gt; Hi. Good to see ya.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.720
&gt;&gt; You too.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.000
&gt;&gt; Bye HaQuyen.
&gt;&gt; Bye Rachel.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.079
&gt;&gt; It was great to see you.
&gt;&gt; It’s always good to see you.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.700
This can happen even when you’ve just met
someone. Let’s say you’re at a small party,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.350
and you meet someone for the first time.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.729
&gt;&gt; Rachel, this is my friend Jacob.
&gt;&gt; Hi Jacob.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.899
&gt;&gt; Hi, nice to meet you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. Thanks for having me.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.159
At the end of the night, when you say goodbye,
you might hug that person.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.049
&gt;&gt; Bye Jacob.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.829
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you!

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.610
Men and women alike hug as a greeting and as
a good bye. Though sometimes, men do something

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.530
more of a slap than a hug.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.040
&gt;&gt; Alright, man.
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.060
&gt;&gt; Talk to you soon.
&gt;&gt; See ya.  Bye.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.319
It can get awkward through. Some people are
less comfortable with hugging, and might offer

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.370
you a hand right as you offer a hug. In these
cases, you just have to figure out what to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.940
do. If you’re not sure what to do, you can
try to wait for the other person to initiate.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.160
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; Oh… hi.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.900
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.230
So, in America, we hug when greeting someone,
and when saying bye.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.069
What is the custom in your country? Let me
