00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,040
I have a lot of memories from when I was

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,470
a child one that's always stuck out to

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,240
me though was when I was about 10 years

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,450
old and I was in school and I struggled

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,049
and I didn't struggle with English math

6
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:19,029
or science I struggled holding still and

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,130
I would try to listen and focus and

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,460
process ideas but I couldn't help myself

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,539
then to be honest I would sit there and

10
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,820
then I would just start tapping and the

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,199
students in the class would look at me

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,170
and they'd say hey stop tapping a lot of

13
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,250
the time I didn't even realize I was

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,800
doing it and then eventually even the

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,270
teachers got after me and they would

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,590
yell at me and they say Clint you have

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,370
to stop tapping

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,220
it got so bad that I got sent to the

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,160
principal's office for tapping and he

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,530
said to me kid maybe when you go back to

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,160
class

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,220
just try sitting on your hands so I did

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,420
I went back to class and when I felt

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,180
myself starting to tap I just I did this

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,000
i sat on my hands and that works for

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,579
about five seconds

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,339
one time I was tapping in class and my

28
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,350
teacher mr. Jensen he looked at me and

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,619
he yelled and he said Clint stay after

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,040
class and I thought to myself this is it

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,270
I am done now I've always been the type

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,800
of person that believes that a single

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,420
moment in time can change a person's

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,030
life and this was one of those moments

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,530
for me that I will never forget it so I

36
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,020
was sitting there with mr. Jensen and an

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,020
empty classroom and he walked past me

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,880
and he sat next to his desk and he said

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,750
Clint come here I'll talk to you and as

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,460
he looked me right in the eye he said

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,170
you know I need you to know something

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,780
you're not in trouble but I do have just

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,260
one question that I have to ask you

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,760
and he asked he said have you ever

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,440
thought about playing the drums and in

46
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,120
that moment mr. Jensen he leaned back

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,860
and he opened the top drawer of his desk

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,130
and he reached in and he pulled out my

49
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,340
very first pair of drumsticks and he

50
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,840
held them in his hands and he looked at

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
me he said hey Clint you're not a

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,700
problem

53
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,720
I think you're in trouble

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,500
[Music]

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,720
from that moment on I've never put those

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,830
six down I've toured recorded and play

57
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,450
drums all over the world my whole

58
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,910
college education was paid for with

59
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,290
drumsticks in my hand

60
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,170
just because of a single moment in time

61
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,930
when somebody believed in me and he saw

62
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,220
something in me that I didn't even see

63
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,940
within myself

64
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,250
and from that moment I learned that

65
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,450
there's a difference between being the

66
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,500
best in the world and being the best for

67
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,030
the world
