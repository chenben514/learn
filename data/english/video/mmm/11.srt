00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.640
Hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.840
Today I'm going to help you to practise

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.340
your pronunciation, I've got twenty English verbs that

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.080
my students often mispronounce

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.460
and these are all essential business English verbs,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.220
ones that are really useful in the workplace.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.220
But most of them are actually really common in

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.780
everyday English as well.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.680
You'll read them in the newspaper,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.520
you'll hear them in films or in podcasts,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.340
even if it's not specifically about

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.620
business or work right.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.140
If you stick with me throughout this whole lesson,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.440
you will definitely be sounding more professional,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.240
communicating more clearly.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.500
I think we should just get into it.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.760
As I said, I have twenty business English verbs

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.380
to go through with you today

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.060
and the reason that many of my students have trouble

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.700
pronouncing these words

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.260
is syllable stress, where to put the stress in the word

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.680
which vowel sound is the strongest and the clearest.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.780
And I wonder how many of them

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.280
you've been mispronouncing without realising it.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100
The good news is it takes a little practice,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.119
some regular practice

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.760
to break your pronunciation habits so that you can

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.160
finally start pronouncing these words correctly,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.020
communicate clearly and effectively and successfully.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.660
So I'm going to go through all of them one by one

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.420
but later on in the lesson, we're going to practise

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.520
using them together in longer sentences

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.740
because this is often where things get tricky

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.520
when you start pushing other sounds and other words

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.700
together around these words.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420
So let's start really simple with share.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.440
Share.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.260
So we start with that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.600
consonant sound but that vowel sound

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.200
may be a little different than you think right? It's not

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.220
it's not

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.000
but

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.180
so it's that

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.580
as in hair vowel sound.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.960
In my Australian accent you don't hear that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.700
sound at the end. It's just finishing on that vowel sound.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.740
Another really common verb is answer.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.320
Now notice that that W is silent right it's not

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.200
and that's where some of my students

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.880
get a little stuck right? That W is silent.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.960
Answer

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.400
which makes it a little easier than

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.120
trying to pronounce that sound, right?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.740
We're going to get into some more advanced verbs

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.860
very soon but it really is quite common for my

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.180
English students, even my advanced students

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.620
to still be making pronunciation mistakes like these.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.420
Pronunciation habits are tricky ones to break

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.380
so don't feel bad if you're

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.000
just realising that you've been making some mistakes

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.460
with your pronunciation.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.920
Today is an awesome day

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.780
because you get the chance to fix them.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.180
Let's keep going!

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.880
Accept.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.340
So these two consonants here

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.640
are exactly the same right but

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.460
they're pronounced differently so it's not

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.540
but

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.840
So there's a stop on that sound

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.600
to help you ease into the next syllable, accept.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.040
The first syllable is unstressed right so it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.660
reduces down to that schwa sound

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.060
The second syllable is the stronger one, it's clearer.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.880
You can hear it very clearly right?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.960
Accept.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.360
A quick note,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.920
if you would like to learn a little bit more about

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.240
syllable stress in English

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.400
then I will definitely link to a great lesson of mine

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.080
at the end of this video.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.340
You can catch it up there if you need it.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.560
Focus.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.360
You don't want to mess up the pronunciation here.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.620
Kind of like share, the vowel sound might be a little

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.680
different to what you think okay?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.880
It's a long diphthong sound

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.180
as in go, right?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.820
Not

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.660
as in hot. okay? It's not

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.140
which sounds a little rude okay? It's not

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.140
It's focus. So see the movement in my mouth

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.760
when I make that sound?

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.120
There's movement in my mouth

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.940
as I'm making that one sound.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.080
Focus.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.240
Present.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.460
So when you're using the verb form of this word,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.039
you really need to focus on syllable stress right

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.720
because it's also common to hear present

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.520
with the stress on the first syllable. It can be a noun

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.000
or it can also be an adjective, present.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.940
But when you're using the verb form, you really need to

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.120
shift that stress onto the second syllable, right?

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.820
Present.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
Produce.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.420
So notice where that stress is there as well?

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.020
It's on the second syllable.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.660
Produce.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.100
There are some slight variations in how native speakers

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.080
pronounce this word. You will hear some

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.320
Americans saying produce

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.080
which might be a little easier

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.060
but in my accent, produce

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.280
like in jam.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.840
Purchase.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.120
So with this one, we really do need to focus on

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.360
syllable stress all right because many of my students

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.639
pronounce or they put the stress on the second

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.820
syllable which is incorrect. It's not

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.520
That's incorrect.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.759
That's pronouncing both syllables with

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.580
equal amount of stress right and of course this

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.660
rarely happens in English.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.760
We usually have one syllable that is

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.480
stronger than another.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.440
So here the correct pronunciation is

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.940
Can you hear that weaker syllable in the second syllable

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.980
We use that schwa vowel sound.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.420
Purchase.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.840
Risk.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.360
And finally, a one syllable word where we don't

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.080
need to worry about syllable stress, right?

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.760
But now we've got a different problem, we've got a very

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.580
tricky set of consonants. We've got

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.960
It's really, really tricky to push those

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.960
two sounds together, right?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.960
As always, when you have two consonant sounds

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.460
or even three together in English words,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.360
the best way to practise

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.380
is to slow right down and practise the two sounds

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.360
next to each other as closely as you can

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.440
without adding any extra sounds, just

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.020
pausing between them.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.140
Try and bring them closer together,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.040
make them a little closer.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.200
Consider.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.060
This is a really great, more advanced word to use

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.680
instead of think. It's a great way to sound more

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.920
professional and to upgrade your English.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.640
Consider.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.680
Can you hear the stressed syllable? Where is it?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.040
It's in the middle, consider.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.540
But it's not

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.460
all right it's that short vowel sound

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.920
there it is.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.160
Consider.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.860
So even though it's a stressed syllable,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.620
that vowel sound is still short

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.200
though it's the strongest one okay

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.220
and naturally the other two syllables either side,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.180
they reduce down all right?

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.400
They're unstressed so they are lower in pitch,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.460
they're softer.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.800
You don't hear them as loudly as the middle one.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.580
Consider.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.540
Measure.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.220
Probably the trickiest thing about this word is that

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.000
consonant sound in the middle.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.700
You know the

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.880
consonant sound right?

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.520
Well this sound is the voiced

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.040
pair to that sound

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.860
which means that we need to activate

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.280
our voice box in order to make it, right?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.200
is made with air.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.760
You can feel that air coming out but

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.040
is made with your vocal cords back here.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.260
Less air, more vocal chords and vibration.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.300
Measure.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.080
Now listen to the difference between the two

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.780
vowel sounds in these different syllables.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.300
Okay so there is a difference in the way that

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.740
the vowel sound is pronounced as well.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.920
Measure.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.100
Identify.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.240
That stress is on the second syllable, right?

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.560
The others are short, they're quick.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.640
Identify.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.380
Multiply.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.080
So take a look at the stressed vowel sound, right?

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.540
It's short, it's that sound as in up not

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.340
not

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.000
but multiply.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.180
Multiply.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.720
Develop.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.060
Now this one is tricky for my Indian, Ukrainian,

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.860
Russian students, anyone who doesn't have the

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.660
consonant sound in their native language, right?

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.800
Often you will mispronounce this word as

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.200
Okay?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.340
This can get you into trouble

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.840
so really spend some time focusing on that sound okay.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.320
We want the bottom of your top teeth here

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.900
to be touching on your bottom lip.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.360
Of course this sound is voiced so we need to activate

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.560
your vocal cords.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.420
Develop.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.220
We want to see those teeth all right? We don't want

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.960
Get those teeth out touching that lip.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.820
In fact, while we're at it let's also talk about value.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.400
All right?

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.460
Value as a verb is a useful one to use professionally,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.960
it helps you to talk about

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.040
things that are important to you, your team,

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.320
your organisation. You can also use it to talk about

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.520
financial value as well.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.460
So it's

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:34.840
not

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.040
Keep practising if you're finding it a little tough.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.100
Value. Can you also hear that

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.340
sound in the end there as well, right?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.620
Not

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.440
Determine.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.280
Not

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.160
all right? That last syllable is unstressed.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.280
The vowel sound is short, reduces right down.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.920
Determine.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.980
Exchange.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.120
There are quite a few crazy looking

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.400
consonants going on there, aren't there?

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.540
Let's just break it down a little. That first syllable is

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.040
unstressed so it's lower in pitch and it's quick.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.820
Just like six but without the

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.180
Then our second syllable is our stressed syllable right

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.040
so it's stronger, it's clearer, it's louder

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.840
than the first one and that vowel sound is the

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.620
diphthong sound

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.640
as in day right? Same sound

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.240
but either side of that sound, we've got an interesting

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.959
consonant pair right? These two sounds are related

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.480
the consonant sound.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.520
See how my lips are flaring out to make

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.540
that sound,  my teeth are together.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.279
This sound is unvoiced okay? It's made with

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.040
air coming through your mouth and making that sound.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.220
But if we keep our lips and

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.040
everything in the same position,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.720
we change that unvoiced sound to be a voiced one

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.660
using our vocal chords.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.760
These two sounds are the ones either side of our

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.060
stressed vowel sound.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Exchange.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.100
Analyse.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.040
So we're starting with a really strong

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.480
stressed syllable here.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.800
But then the schwa sound, an unstressed syllable

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.660
follows.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.940
Then we add that

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.060
voiced sound at the end

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.700
to finish things off.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.500
Analyse.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.620
Sometimes this verb is mispronounced because

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.480
it's quite similar to the noun, analysis right?

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.280
Analysis is the result of

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.740
this action right? To analyse.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.180
So when you say it make sure you feel and you hear

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.780
that final consonant sound.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.540
Analyse

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.720
right? For all my Vietnamese speakers

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.460
make sure you hit that final consonant sound okay?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.260
Same with authorise.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.420
Starting with

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.400
as in door followed by

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.820
the TH sound.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.020
right? It's the unvoiced TH sound made with air

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.100
followed by the schwa.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.680
Authorise.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.180
Distribute.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.640
Say it with me. Distribute.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.360
Can you notice where the stress is?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.540
It's in the middle right? It's on the second syllable.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.960
That first syllable is unstressed.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.140
Distribute.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.480
And the last trickiest one

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.860
negotiate.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.520
The end of the word is really tricky, right?

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.140
It doesn't really look like how it should sound.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.600
Really it's pronounced,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.180
if you close your eyes and you just listen

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.820
Negotiate.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.300
So those are all of the words for today's lesson.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.220
If you want to go back over those words

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.580
before we practise them together,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.500
no problem! You're in control. Just rewind,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.920
watch them through again.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.980
But right now I want to put those words

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.200
into longer sentences to help you practise them

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.840
more quickly right, practise them at pace

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.500
and this is often where you get stuck right?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.080
So as you speed up your speech and you start adding

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.340
extra words and sounds around these words,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.780
that's where things get a little tricky and that's

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.860
exactly what we're about to practise.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.740
I'm gonna read it out first.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.680
You can listen but then it's your turn okay?

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.120
Make sure you're somewhere where you can

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.420
practise out loud.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.620
After you do it, I'm gonna say it one more time again.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.680
Don't forget that you're in control of this video okay?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.660
If you need to pause, listen again, rewind a little,

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.720
play it again, it's totally up to you.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.760
Take your time, do what you need to do to practise.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.540
In fact, you can even slow down the speed of this video

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.480
by using the controls down there, slow it down

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.920
to help you really focus on my pronunciation.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.300
Listen to if you're pronouncing it in the same way,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.980
make some adjustments.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.620
There is absolutely no problem. You're in control.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.720
Right so you're ready to try with me?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.980
I don't want to risk losing this customer.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.540
Perhaps we should consider a different option.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.500
I don't want to risk losing this customer,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.040
perhaps we should consider a different option.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.440
If we don't measure our growth,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.600
how will we determine if we're profitable?

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.960
If we don't measure our growth

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.200
how will we determine if we're profitable?

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.400
The company distributes profits based on the

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.480
deal negotiated by each stakeholder.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.080
The company distributes profits based on the

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.940
deal negotiated by each stakeholder.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.340
I would have never authorised that payment

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.120
without the contractor accepting our terms.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.280
I would have never authorised that payment

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.020
without the contractor accepting our terms.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.340
Are you happy to answer a few questions

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.140
about your experience?

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.720
Are you happy to answer a few questions

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.240
about your experience?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.900
Amy identifies new cultural trends and exchanges ideas

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.300
with researchers at the university.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.460
Amy identifies new cultural trends and exchanges ideas

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.760
with researchers at the university.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.820
Before we present the new strategy to the board,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.200
we need to determine the resources needed to deliver it!

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.760
Before we present the new strategy to the board,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.800
we need to determine the resources needed to deliver it!

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.340
Whenever we purchase new property,

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.880
we analyse the market to ensure the value is justified.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.200
Whenever we purchase new property,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.800
we analyse the market to ensure the value is justified.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.900
Since developing a new master plan, the number of new

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.520
residents has multiplied every month.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.060
Since developing a new master plan, the number of

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.940
new residents every month.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.720
Let's focus on strategies to produce new

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.700
content to share on our website.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.540
Let's focus on strategies to produce new content

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.080
to share on our website.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.980
How'd you do? I know a couple of them were

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.280
a little bit like a tongue twister

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.080
but you did really well to get all the way through them.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.120
Thank you so much for joining me today.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.680
I hope that you enjoyed the lesson,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.560
that you enjoyed the practice.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.159
And I want to know which of those words

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.200
were especially difficult for you to pronounce?

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.640
Make sure you spend a little bit of extra time this week

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.000
practising those tricky sounds and those

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.260
tricky words right?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.840
