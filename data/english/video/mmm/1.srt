00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
Speaking face-to-face with customers, your boss, or any

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.020
of the other people that you work with can be a little

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.600
tricky, especially when you're dealing with problems

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.600
or difficult situations.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.140
Your choice of words and the phrases that you use can

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.660
affect what customers and your colleagues think of you.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.760
So, if you speak English as a second or a third language,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.680
using the right words in the right way

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.960
is really important.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.360
I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.840
and today I'm going to walk you through five situations

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.900
that are super common in just about any workplace,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.800
to help you to avoid the things that you should never say

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.340
and

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.880
give you some really simple expressions

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.020
that will help people to see you

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.180
for the helpful professional that you truly are.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.540
So, are you ready to get to work?

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.440
Situation number one.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.380
Someone asks you a question

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.540
but you don't know the answer.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.660
Excuse me, do you know if the Bluetooth adapter

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.400
will work on the Sony A6400?

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.800
Ahhh... I don't know.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.400
When someone asks you a question

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.220
and you simply don't know the answer,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.620
well never say "I don't know".

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.620
Even though this is the truth,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.480
even though, those are the correct English words to say,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.960
you're not being helpful at all!

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.160
So, saying "I don't know" in the workplace -

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.600
especially to a customer -

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.900
sounds really unprofessional in English,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.240
even a little bit rude.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.120
It's like saying you don't care.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.020
So to sound more professional

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.380
and to show that you do care, try saying

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
"I'm not sure, but I can find out".

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.900
So, say it with me,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.420
Or you could say "I'll find out for you."

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.640
Awesome!

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.100
Here's another one:

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100
"Let me come back to you on that"

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.820
So, you can use this to say

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.100
that you need a little more time to find the answer

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.340
but you're assuring the person

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.660
that you will try to help them.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.380
Excellent! You're sounding really helpful

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380
and much more professional already!

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.380
Speaking of sounding more professional,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.600
if you need to improve your English skills at work

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.140
when you're speaking to clients or customers

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.760
or colleagues, then listen up,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.580
because the Lingoda Language Marathon is back!

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.500
Now this is awesome news for you

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.780
if you want to improve your English skills

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.680
in just 90 days.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.380
But you've got to be ready to do it quickly because

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.940
this Language Marathon is going to be the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.420
last Lingoda Marathon ever!

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.720
If you've heard me talk about the Marathon before,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.940
then you'll know that you can complete it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.680
as a full marathon or a half marathon.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.700
The full marathon is one class a day for three months

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.680
and the half marathon is fifteen classes a month

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.020
for three months.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.660
You can choose to enrol in General English

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.900
or Business English specific classes.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.920
All of them are group classes held online

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.400
and led by native English teachers.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.060
And the awesome thing is

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.660
if you complete your marathon successfully,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.080
Lingoda will refund up to 100% of your class fees,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.240
which is super cool, right?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.560
I'm doing the Spanish Marathon right now with Lingoda

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.740
and I can confidently tell you that my speaking skills

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.660
have increased dramatically

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.300
and it's all because of the marathon.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.440
It's helped to keep me accountable and stay motivated

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.280
to make sure that I reach my goal.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.000
Like I said, this is the last Marathon ever

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.080
so if you want to take part in it, you need to do it now!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.580
To register and secure your place,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.460
you need to pay a deposit of €49

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.420
by the 9th of September.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.040
For all of the details and to register,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.700
use the link you see in the description below and

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.820
make sure you add this code at the checkout,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.420
it's going to get you a €10 discount

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.520
off your deposit.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.480
Now, it's time to get back to work!

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.700
Situation number two.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.120
Someone asks you if you can do something

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.120
by a specific time.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.640
So this happens all the time at work, right?

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.880
Especially if you work at a place that has deadlines.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.800
Emma, ummm...

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.000
Our clients need this done by 2 o'clock tomorrow,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.040
do you think you can manage that?

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.780
I'll try to finish it.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.000
So.. Yes?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.900
Can I tell them that we'll have it done by 2?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.040
I'll try my best.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.220
When someone asks you if something can be done

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.860
by a certain time,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.280
don't use the phrase "I'll try".

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.980
I mean, of course, you'll try

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.900
and trying is great!

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.000
But in English, if you use the verb 'try',

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.180
you're not really committing to anything

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.560
You're not saying that you will or you won't

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.040
or you can or you can't do something, right?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.820
You're not committing to a deadline at all

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.880
so you're not being very helpful

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.200
and this is not very professional at all!

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.200
The person asking you has asked a specific

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200
yes/no question:

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.320
Can you get it done by this time?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.920
So you need to give a really clear-cut answer, okay?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.780
You can sound much more professional

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.100
simply by saying:

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.160
I can get it done by 2pm.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.980
So, say it with me.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.020
Sure, I can have it done by 2pm.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.680
Great!

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.920
But what if you can't get it done by 2pm

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.940
or by the end of the day?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.940
What if you can't get it done?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.760
Well, you definitely shouldn't say

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.460
that you'll try, seriously.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.000
Saying that you'll try might make them

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.240
go away in the short term.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.140
But you're going to let them down in the long run

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.980
and that is really unprofessional.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.740
You need to be honest with them

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.340
but you also need to make a commitment

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.900
to reassure them when you can get it done by.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.560
So, in this situation try an alternative like:

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.740
I don't think I can manage it by 2,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.260
but I can have it done by 4.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.420
Actually, I don't think I can manage it by 2

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.460
but I can definitely have it done by 4.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.380
I don't think I can manage it by Thursday,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.960
but I can definitely have it done by Friday.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.420
Would that be okay?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.480
Nice work! Let's keep going.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.960
Situation number three.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.700
Uh-oh... Your boss or a customer is angry

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.400
or disappointed about something.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.200
Now, it could be something that you did personally,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.240
like, maybe you were late

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.020
or perhaps it's not actually your fault

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.040
but you still need to deal with this situation.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.940
This is ridiculous! I drove the whole way down here

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.780
to pick the thing up. I even rang you this morning

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.640
and now you're telling me it's not ready?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.400
Okay...

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.080
Okay? That's all you've got... Okay?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.160
Yes.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.000
Alright, so nobody really wants to deal with

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.500
angry or frustrated customers, do they?

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.380
And if something like that's ever happened to you,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.580
you might even freeze up

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.420
and get really awkward.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.520
it's not really a good look, right?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.540
But of course, there's always going to be someone

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.880
who's unhappy or frustrated

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.600
about something at some point.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.640
It's just part of working life, isn't it?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.780
So, it's a good idea to have a plan so in those situations

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.260
you've got something to say to make the situation better

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.740
and not worse!

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.080
Lucky for you there are two really important words

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.620
that will make everything a little better.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.480
I understand.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.680
Simple, huh?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.060
So before you freeze up and just say

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.560
"okay" or "yes",

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.440
just remember, all you need to say is "I understand"

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.480
With these really simple words, for just a moment,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.280
you can make the situation better .

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.120
You'll help the other person to see that you're listening

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.020
and show them that you care about helping them

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.400
and of course, then you need to offer

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.780
something to help the situation, right? A solution.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.400
So try these with me.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.400
I understand. Let's see what we can do.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.540
I'm sorry, I understand.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.780
Let's see what we can do about this.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.420
Notice that I used the word 'let's' and 'we' instead of 'I'.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.220
This is a really great way to involve the other person

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.500
in the solution.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.720
I understand you've come all this way and it's not ready.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.540
Let's see what we can do.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.560
Awesome!

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.400
So you're ready for the next one, right?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.500
Situation number four, numero cuatro.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.760
Well when you're keeping somebody waiting,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.260
what should you do?

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.220
Maybe you're busy with another customer,

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.540
maybe you're on a phone call

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.520
or maybe you really need to go to the toilet

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.980
and you've got to leave quickly.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.980
Whatever the case,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.180
the worst thing that you could possibly say is:

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.260
Things are just really busy today

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.700
so it's taking a bit longer than usual.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.880
Yeah, yeah we've just had loads of new clients come in.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.040
Hang on a sec!

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.020
No no no no no no no. This is not good, okay?

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.380
You know this situation right? It's just rude.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.840
But fortunately there are a couple of phrases

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.000
that you can memorise that will have you sounding

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.600
really professional and keep the person

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.200
who's waiting happy.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.200
So the first one is:

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.480
I'll be with you in a moment.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.340
And this expression just lets them know that you know

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.200
that they're there and that you won't be long

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.220
until you give them your full attention. So say it with me.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.700
Brilliant! Alright and the second one is:

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.740
Sorry to keep you waiting, I'll be right there.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.100
You try it.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.440
Sorry to keep you waiting,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.760
I'll be there with you in just a minute.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.460
Can you think of any other ways to respond

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.460
in this type of situation?

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.280
If you can, add them to the comments below.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.200
Situation number five.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.400
So when somebody asks you a question

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.000
but you didn't quite hear them

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.780
or maybe you didn't understand them.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.900
What should you do?

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.460
Hey Emma, do you reckon you can let the guys go early

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.980
this afternoon? I'm gonna nick off too.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.260
What?

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.260
Never say "what". Ever.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.760
Okay? This is one that the parents and teachers

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.080
of English speaking children are always

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.280
trying to teach them

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.000
and it's a really big no-no in the workplace.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.860
You can sound much more professional by saying:

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.480
I'm sorry, I missed that.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.960
You try it.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.820
I'm sorry, I missed that. Could you say it again, please?

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.960
Awesome! So now try:

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
Sorry, would you mind just repeating that?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.220
Sorry, would you mind just repeating that for me?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.220
I missed it.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.220
Now there are lots of different ways to let

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.680
someone know that you didn't understand them, right?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.680
And politely ask them

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.980
to repeat themselves a little more clearly.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.580
Can you think of any other ways that you could

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.440
say the same thing?

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.820
If you can, add them into the comments.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.300
So I hope this lesson has given you some options

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.120
to help you sound a little more professional at work.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.900

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.420
