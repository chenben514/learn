00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:13.998
regular practice, the practice that you&nbsp;need

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.987
to speak English confidently and fluently.

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:19.986
Hey Lady! is a safe and supportive space for women

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:23.696

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.633
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:41.583
and in&nbsp;this lesson, I'm going to show you how to show respect

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:45.776
in English because it's something&nbsp;that my students ask me often

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:49.239
because they've realised that in English we don't have many

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.862
specific words or pronouns to show respect

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.810
like lots of other languages do so I'm going to go&nbsp;over

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.935
three main things in this lesson:

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.005
how to greet people in a respectful way,

00:01:03.177 --> 00:01:07.210
especially people&nbsp;who are older than you or your boss or manager,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.453
your lecturer,

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:12.609
people that you respect and you&nbsp;want to show respect to.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:17.480
I'll also show you how we address people respectfully 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.040
and how in English our actions are often more important

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.736
than words when we're communicating

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:27.365
and we're&nbsp;showing respect.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.618

if you enjoy this video, you know what to do.

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:50.215
A little while back, I made a lesson about how to be polite

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.830
and show respect in English.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.559
It really focused on how to say no politely,

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:00.445
how to&nbsp;make polite requests and suggestions

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:04.436
but it did get me thinking about showing respect

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:09.440
in English&nbsp;because many other languages have really specific

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.606
pronouns or ways to address

00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:14.328
older people or&nbsp;people who you respect.

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:18.129
My Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese students will all know

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.878
how important those pronouns are when addressing

00:02:21.878 --> 00:02:24.892
family members or people who are older than you.

00:02:24.892 --> 00:02:27.501
I mean it's&nbsp;built into your languages, isn't it?

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:31.797
So how do you do that? How do you show that same respect

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:34.594
when&nbsp;you're communicating in English?

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:40.351
We don't have many pronouns that show respect in

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:45.170
general everyday&nbsp;language but you can show respect in other ways

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.775
and the most important way to show respect in&nbsp;English is by

00:02:48.775 --> 00:02:50.800
greeting someone properly.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.101
It's going to set the tone for the whole conversation

00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:57.920
and&nbsp;most people choose to greet with a really informal

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.426
hello, hi, hey.

00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:04.209
Casual and friendly way to say hello&nbsp;right?

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:08.480
Perfectly acceptable greeting but if you deliberately want to show

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.181
respect to someone&nbsp;you can make your language

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.826
a little more formal.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.214
You can say:

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:18.689
Good morning, good afternoon, good&nbsp;evening.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:23.769
All of these expressions are really common, you know them,

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.942
but just by choosing these&nbsp;greetings you're instantly sounding

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:30.873
more polite and showing more respect

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:34.984
and if you're meeting&nbsp;someone that you respect for the first time,

00:03:34.984 --> 00:03:38.583
you might also add: It's a pleasure to meet&nbsp;you.

00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:41.280
Good afternoon, it's a pleasure to meet you.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.764
Just remember, you wouldn't actually say "good&nbsp;night"

00:03:45.764 --> 00:03:49.230
when you greet someone right because "good night" indicates

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.410
that you're leaving, it's&nbsp;a little more like goodbye.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.512
All right let's talk about addressing someone with respect.

00:03:56.512 --> 00:04:00.365
I know in&nbsp;lots of the Asian cultures where I've lived there have been

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:04.498
specific pronouns used to show respect&nbsp;especially when you're

00:04:04.498 --> 00:04:07.686
referring to someone who's older than you, you might say

00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:08.981
auntie or uncle.

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.565
How&nbsp;do you show respect in your language? Do you have

00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:15.795
some similar pronouns like this? Something that you&nbsp;use

00:04:15.795 --> 00:04:18.173
to show respect to those who are older?

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:20.913
Let me know down in the comments, I'm really interested&nbsp;to hear

00:04:20.913 --> 00:04:21.440
from you.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.002
Like I said in English we don't have many specific titles that

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:29.449
immediately&nbsp;show respect but there are some exceptions

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.280
made for certain professions. So we address&nbsp;doctors by saying

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.305
Dr. Jones with their surname.

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:40.020
Maybe for some professors, you might do the same

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.031
thing, Professor Saunders.

00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.576
In a formal situation or definitely at school,

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:51.395
we would use a certain title&nbsp;followed by a person's name

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:53.184
so it would be Miss

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.738
Emma Jakobi or Miss Jakobi for a woman.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.245
Mr Smith

00:04:59.494 --> 00:05:03.420
or Mrs Smith if it was a married woman.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.486
Now some teachers and especially teachers at language&nbsp;schools

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:10.007
or even tutors at universities, 

00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:14.051
they may just prefer you to call them by their first&nbsp;name

00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:16.656
and if you're unsure about what to call them

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:19.395
you can politely ask them by saying:

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.357
How&nbsp;should I address you?

00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:23.974
Should I call you Mr Turner?

00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:27.349
That way, you'll find out exactly what&nbsp;they expect

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.326
and what they feel comfortable with.

00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:33.460
Now what I do want to talk to you about are the&nbsp;titles that are not

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.559
often used and sometimes can seem so formal

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.672
that they make people feel a&nbsp;little uncomfortable

00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:43.186
especially if they're used in the wrong context.

00:05:43.397 --> 00:05:46.806
Sir and madam or ma'am

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:50.211
are not very common in Australia or in the UK.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.868
However, they may be heard a little more often in&nbsp;parts of the US

00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:58.044
especially in customer service

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.992
or with people who are involved in the military.

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:05.535
And I know that for some of you it might seem strange

00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:09.824
or even a little rude to call your&nbsp;manager or your boss

00:06:09.824 --> 00:06:11.723
by their first name.

00:06:11.723 --> 00:06:15.187
You might instinctively want to refer to your boss as

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:16.273
boss.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.583
Good morning boss! Can I help you with that boss?

00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:25.112
But to many English speakers, this would feel a little strange. 

00:06:25.112 --> 00:06:28.619
They may feel more comfortable if you just refer to them by their

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:29.598
first name.

00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:32.902
Now the&nbsp;trick is when someone introduces themselves

00:06:32.902 --> 00:06:37.316
to you, you just need to listen to the name that they&nbsp;use.

00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:41.065
They're telling you how to address them.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.806
The most respectful thing that you can do

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:48.384
is to&nbsp;call them the name that they have offered to you

00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:52.286
because if you choose to call them something&nbsp;else

00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:54.841
because you think that's more respectful,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.490
it's kind of showing disrespect by not calling&nbsp;them what they want

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.793
you to call them.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.580
Excuse me goes a long, long way in English.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.966
When you want to&nbsp;show someone respect, this phrase is essential.

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:14.479
It's always awkward to interrupt someone when they're&nbsp;speaking

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.058
or maybe when they're doing something else

00:07:17.058 --> 00:07:20.825
especially when you're talking to your&nbsp;superior at work.

00:07:21.285 --> 00:07:23.057
Sometimes it's got to be done

00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:27.397
and the most respectful way to do this is to say:

00:07:27.397 --> 00:07:31.834
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. Would you mind helping me...?

00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:36.203
It's also a good way to ask someone to&nbsp;move out of the way.

00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:39.259
Excuse me, would you mind if I get past? 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.510
Oh sure.

00:07:41.162 --> 00:07:46.113
It might seem simple but please&nbsp;and thank you are essential too.

00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:49.497
English speakers know that as a child this was 

00:07:49.497 --> 00:07:51.797
one of the first&nbsp;things that you were taught.

00:07:51.797 --> 00:07:54.333
When I was growing&nbsp;up my parents were adamant

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:58.560
that my brothers&nbsp;and I were always saying please and thank you

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.712
when we wanted something. We wouldn't get it

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:01.981
without those words.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:07.092
In some languages, they're not as important as they are in English.

00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:10.845
Please&nbsp;and thank you are just so important in English

00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:13.345
when you are trying to show respect.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.829
When you make&nbsp;a really simple request,

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.811
if it's just pass the salt add please.

00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:21.381
Please pass the salt.

00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:23.673
Could you please pass me the salt?

00:08:23.846 --> 00:08:26.224
Could you pass the salt, please?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.215
And then of course, when you get the salt,

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.219
you'd&nbsp;say thank you.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.775
And that person, if they're showing respect will also say

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:36.219
you're welcome.

00:08:36.526 --> 00:08:40.259
These are&nbsp;all really common phrases that are essential

00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:44.375
if you are trying to show respect to someone in&nbsp;English.

00:08:44.854 --> 00:08:48.770
Now if you remember at the beginning of this lesson I said that

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.896
for English speakers,&nbsp;the way that you show respect

00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:56.654
is also based on your actions, not just words.

00:08:56.654 --> 00:08:59.096
So let's talk&nbsp;about some examples.

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:02.285
Be on time. Be punctual.

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:05.156
Do you know that word? Punctual.

00:09:05.405 --> 00:09:09.278
So if you're punctual, it&nbsp;means that you're on time

00:09:09.278 --> 00:09:13.461
and I know that for many different cultures it's not really a big deal

00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:16.655
if&nbsp;you're late but in most English-speaking countries,

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:20.798
people place a lot of emphasis on being on&nbsp;time.

00:09:20.798 --> 00:09:23.251
It's quite disrespectful to be late

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.938
and to keep someone waiting for you.

00:09:25.938 --> 00:09:29.433
So maybe&nbsp;you're late to work, you're late for a class.

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:33.777
It's just not that acceptable so you want to try and&nbsp;be on time

00:09:33.777 --> 00:09:36.262
and if you're not going to be on time

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.335
let them know, send a text, an email, make a call

00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:42.649
and&nbsp;let them know that you're going to be running late.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.027
Five or ten minutes might be ok but anything longer&nbsp;than that

00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:50.624
and you're showing disrespect.

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:54.951
Another important and respectful action that people&nbsp;in

00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:57.638
English-speaking countries really value

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.119
is listening.

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:03.619
So if someone is talking and&nbsp;you start checking your phone or

00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:07.180
doodling on your notepad or talking to a friend,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.653
that is&nbsp;being disrespectful and so in this situation

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.425
it's your actions that is speaking much,&nbsp;much louder than words.

00:10:16.808 --> 00:10:18.453
Don't push in.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.303
Waiting patiently for your turn is a hallmark of&nbsp;respect

00:10:24.303 --> 00:10:28.016
in English-speaking cultures. If you push in, you're sending a

00:10:28.016 --> 00:10:30.958
big loud message to everyone&nbsp;else who's waiting that you don't

00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.618
care about them or how long they've been waiting.

00:10:33.618 --> 00:10:37.773
Now I know that in some cultures it's completely acceptable

00:10:37.773 --> 00:10:42.258
for older people or certain people to move to the&nbsp;front of a line

00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:46.164
and to kind of jostle in front of someone but this is extremely

00:10:46.164 --> 00:10:48.680
disrespectful in&nbsp;western cultures.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.832
and in English-speaking countries

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.952
It is seen as very polite and very respectful&nbsp;to offer your place

00:10:55.952 --> 00:10:57.363
to someone who needs it

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.556
but not to push in because you're older or&nbsp;because you need it.

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:05.087
You would always ask politely.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.756
Usually, I have a little challenge at the end&nbsp;for you 

00:11:08.756 --> 00:11:12.728
but for this lesson, I'd like you to share what is respectful

00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:15.476
and disrespectful in your&nbsp;culture.

00:11:15.476 --> 00:11:18.400
So down in the comments, can you tell me

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.042
how you show respect in your native language or&nbsp;culture?

00:11:23.042 --> 00:11:25.948
Do you greet or address people differently

00:11:25.948 --> 00:11:28.211
because of their age or their status?

00:11:28.364 --> 00:11:32.554
And what&nbsp;actions are seen as disrespectful?

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.170
I think it's fascinating that we all have different ways&nbsp;of showing

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.697
respect in our different cultures through language or through our

00:11:40.697 --> 00:11:45.414
actions but it&nbsp;is really important to understand and to learn

00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:49.726
how to show respect in different cultures&nbsp;and of course,

00:11:49.726 --> 00:11:52.939
make sure we're not being disrespectful.

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:56.309
So I hope this video has given&nbsp;you some new ideas about how you

00:11:56.309 --> 00:11:58.602
can show more respect in English,

00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:03.782
I've given you some great&nbsp;tools to use to greet people respectfully,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.549
to address people respectfully or in the right&nbsp;way

00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:12.681
and showing respect through your actions,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.557
the things that you do.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.065
So you know what to do&nbsp;now, you want to take these tools

00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:21.312
and go out and test them out in the real world.

00:12:21.312 --> 00:12:24.281
And if&nbsp;you haven't checked out these lessons here yet

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.357
I think you should, you'll love them.

00:12:26.357 --> 00:12:29.920
Have an&nbsp;amazing week and I will see you next time!
