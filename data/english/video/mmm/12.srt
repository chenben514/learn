00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.208
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:06.736
Today I'm going to teach you to introduce

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:08.306
yourself effectively.

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:11.263
And there are three reasons why this is

00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:13.263
such an important skill to learn.

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:16.060
Of course, we've got to introduce ourselves

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.097
all the time, right? In lots of different contexts.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:23.332
So spending the time getting your introduction right

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.944
is gonna help you and it's gonna benefit you

00:00:26.104 --> 00:00:28.416
over and over and over again.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.309
And when you meet someone new,

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.240
you will likely feel a little nervous.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.921
It's totally normal, right?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.198
But if you can get off to a good start,

00:00:38.198 --> 00:00:40.730
then it's gonna help you to feel more confident

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.659
going into the rest of the conversation.

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:45.776
So nailing that first introduction

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:47.244
is so important.

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:50.388
And of course, if you can introduce yourself

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:52.042
clearly and confidently,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.155
you'll make a great first impression

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:55.425
with people that you meet.

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:58.303
This is going to help you build great relationships,

00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:01.420
to make friends and be liked

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.963
which really, deep down is what we all really want.

00:01:04.963 --> 00:01:08.302
Ideally, you're watching this video with your notebook

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:11.116
handy so that you can take some notes as we go.

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:15.238
You can listen to me talk about introducing yourself

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:17.690
as much as you like but if you don't start

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.339
playing with the language and the ideas that I'm sharing today

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:24.000
to make it useful and relevant for yourself,

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:25.334
what's the point?

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.335
So if you've shown up today and you're ready to participate

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:29.569
in this lesson,

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.899
let me know in the comments, I'm really excited to get started.

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:35.867
And of course, if you can think of a friend or a colleague

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.867
who needs to work on this skill too,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.383
share this lesson with them, make sure you subscribe

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:42.530
and let's get into it!

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:54.713
So imagine hearing this question:

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.394
Tell us about yourself.

00:01:56.713 --> 00:02:00.867
And feeling cool, calm and collected as you reply.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.878
That is exactly what we're working towards today.

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:08.246
We want to, not only just answer this question with ease,

00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:10.751
but we want to do it accurately as well.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:13.744
There are lots of different places and contexts

00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:16.372
where you might need to introduce yourself.

00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:20.553
Some of them are formal, some of them are really informal.

00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:23.990
So knowing your context and your audience

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.666
is extremely important, I can't stress that enough.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.473
It's so important.

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.148
And adjusting your introduction just slightly

00:02:33.148 --> 00:02:37.435
to those different situations is a really powerful skill to learn.

00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:40.073
Because it might be useful to talk about your education

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:42.685
and your profession in some contexts,

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:46.228
but really weird to bring that up at a party, right?

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.452
Like that's a good way to bore someone to tears.

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:53.816
So let's get started with your introduction today.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.495
And how do we start?

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.412
We start really simply and casually with your name.

00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:02.954
I am Emma or I'm Emma.

00:03:03.592 --> 00:03:07.188
Now in most situations, it's much more natural to use

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:11.821
the contraction I'm Emma, it sounds much more relaxed that way.

00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:14.752
You can also say: My name is Emma.

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:16.459
Or my name's Emma.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.778
Simple, right? You've got this.

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:22.587
Now what if you have a preferred name or a nickname?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.449
It is always really good to let the person who you're addressing

00:03:26.742 --> 00:03:29.221
know right up front right?

00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:32.498
And an informal way to do that is to say:

00:03:32.737 --> 00:03:34.737
My friends all call me

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.149
My name is Beatrice, but my friends all call me Bee.

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:43.038
A slightly more formal way to do that is to say:

00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:45.251
My name is Ybiskay,

00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:49.618
but it's hard for some people to say it, so you can call me Ybis.

00:03:49.618 --> 00:03:52.708
This is a really great expression to note down

00:03:52.894 --> 00:03:55.612
if people find it really hard to say your name.

00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:58.064
Maybe it's a long name, maybe it's not

00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:00.835
a very common name in the place where you live.

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:04.059
You kind of get sick of having to explain it again and again.

00:04:04.298 --> 00:04:06.298
So as long as you don't mind,

00:04:06.298 --> 00:04:09.655
then this is a really great way to introduce your name

00:04:09.655 --> 00:04:12.480
or a version of your name that you'd like to be called.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.787
The next piece of basic information to include

00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:17.351
is something about location.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.479
It could be to do with where you're living now

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.479
or where you're from originally.

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:26.634
And there's lots of different ways to elaborate on this

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:27.799
type of information.

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:31.081
So I'm going to give you a few different ways of doing it here

00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:33.453
but it's up to you to pick and choose

00:04:33.453 --> 00:04:36.172
which version works best for your story.

00:04:36.172 --> 00:04:37.634
Okay so experiment,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.804
get a little playful with some of these combinations.

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:42.938
I'm from Australia.

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:47.385
And again, I'm using that contracted form here because

00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:49.651
I am from Australia

00:04:49.944 --> 00:04:54.152
sounds just a little bit stiff, you know so to sound more relaxed,

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:57.509
and more natural, say: I'm from

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.232
with your country or your city name, could be either.

00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:04.059
You could say: I am

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.920
and your nationality adjective, so I'm Australian.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.266
Turkish, Vietnamese, Brazilian.

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:15.005
These are all examples of nationality adjectives.

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:18.282
And these nationality adjectives are usually different

00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:20.122
to the country name, right?

00:05:20.122 --> 00:05:23.239
So you've got to be careful that you're using the right form

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.931
of the word with each of these expressions.

00:05:26.224 --> 00:05:27.479
We don't say:

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.479
I'm from Australian.

00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:32.330
Or I am Australia.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.511
Now if you said: I'm from Melbourne.

00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:38.929
It's actually not super clear

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:41.650
whether that's the place where you live now

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.022
or where you're from originally.

00:05:44.634 --> 00:05:47.219
So if you're not from the place that you're in

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.618
while you're making the introduction,

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.054
then you could say: I come from

00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:55.852
a place, you know and we use this

00:05:55.852 --> 00:05:58.065
when there's a bit of distance between

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:01.794
where you are now and wherever that place is so it could be

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.406
another city or another country.

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:07.683
But if you want to be clearer, all you need to do is just

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:10.029
choose some more specific verbs.

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.284
You could say:

00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:14.348
I was born in, with the place name.

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:15.976
I was born in Melbourne.

00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:18.000
I grew up in

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:20.481
or I was raised in.

00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:25.247
Or even, I spent my childhood in

00:06:25.566 --> 00:06:27.566
and a place name, so this is talking about

00:06:27.832 --> 00:06:30.311
you know when you were a child, where were you

00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:33.136
what were you doing, it's an interesting way to bring up

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:34.604
that part of your life.

00:06:34.976 --> 00:06:37.746
And they all express a really similar idea so you

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:39.960
can pick and choose how you use them.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.553
I was born in Australia and spent my childhood growing up

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:46.881
in various cities along the east coast.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.929
I’m originally from Melbourne, but now I'm based in Perth. 

00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:54.000
So if you wanna say how long you've been living in your

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
current location, it is

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.011
the perfect chance to use the present perfect.

00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:03.245
I’ve been living in Perth since 2016. 

00:07:03.862 --> 00:07:06.820
I’ve lived in Perth for the past four years. 

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.554
Or I could also say:

00:07:08.554 --> 00:07:12.000
I moved to Perth a few years ago. 

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.485
There are just so many different ways to express this

00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:18.496
information, honestly. I could keep going!

00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:21.772
And I'm sure that many of these structures are actually

00:07:21.772 --> 00:07:25.608
really familiar to you but as you're preparing your introduction,

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:28.911
really pay attention to the story that you're telling.

00:07:29.204 --> 00:07:32.214
And take the time to make sure that you're expressing

00:07:32.214 --> 00:07:34.400
your ideas accurately.

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:37.731
And once you write your introduction, you are most welcome

00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.890
to add it down into the comments below.

00:07:40.183 --> 00:07:42.183
I'll take a look at as many as I can

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:44.183
and make sure that they sound awesome.

00:07:44.822 --> 00:07:47.381
So talking about your name, your location,

00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:48.955
these are the basics.

00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:52.046
And like I said earlier, if you can get this part right,

00:07:52.046 --> 00:07:56.174
and you can just say it really naturally as soon as you get asked,

00:07:56.467 --> 00:07:59.212
then this is going to set you up really well

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.999
for what comes next.

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:04.968
And what comes next really does depend on the context

00:08:04.968 --> 00:08:08.165
so I've got a few different options for you to consider here.

00:08:08.617 --> 00:08:11.468
If you are introducing yourself to

00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:14.612
a new neighbour for example, you might choose to focus 

00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:16.319
more on your family.

00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:19.437
But then if you're introducing yourself at a job interview

00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:22.954
you might talk about job related experience, obviously.

00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:26.949
And if you're introducing yourself to an English class, you might

00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:29.613
focus on your hobbies and your interests,

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:32.624
things that will help the other people in your class

00:08:32.784 --> 00:08:36.673
connect with you and you know, reveal their shared interests.

00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:39.704
Now you might want to talk about your family

00:08:39.704 --> 00:08:41.787
a little bit when you introduce yourself.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.931
And the amount of information that you share here is up to you

00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:46.931
whatever you feel comfortable sharing.

00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:49.649
We want to be careful not to overshare

00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:53.166
you know, to bore someone with your entire family history

00:08:53.405 --> 00:08:56.442
unless they asked for it because they're particularly interested.

00:08:56.442 --> 00:08:58.499
But if you're married you would say:

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:01.802
We've been married since

00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:03.920
and a time or a date.

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:09.405
I’ve been married to my husband since August last year.

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:10.660
For example.

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:13.893
Now if you're not married but you still want to mention

00:09:13.893 --> 00:09:17.373
the length of your relationship, you can say:

00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:21.422
We've been together for and a time period.

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:23.502
Okay, we've been together.

00:09:23.502 --> 00:09:28.348
In a relationship context, that tells the length of your relationship.

00:09:28.348 --> 00:09:31.811
I always find it kind of tricky to talk about my relationship with

00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:34.902
my partner in English because we don't actually have

00:09:34.902 --> 00:09:36.636
many words to describe it.

00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:40.951
My partner, Shah and I have been together for eleven years now.

00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:42.048
We're engaged

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:45.638
but we've been engaged for about six or seven years now.

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:48.356
So we have no plans to get married

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:51.112
so he's not ever going to be my husband.

00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:55.878
I can introduce him as my fiance, but then I always get asked

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:59.262
When's the wedding? You know, what are your plans?

00:09:59.262 --> 00:10:00.180
And of course,

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.161
we have none so that conversation gets really boring.

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.528
And after eleven years of being together,

00:10:06.528 --> 00:10:09.405
the word boyfriend is really flippant

00:10:09.405 --> 00:10:13.231
and not particularly useful so I usually just call him

00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:14.167
my partner.

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:19.200
But in our situation, we are business partners too

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.514
and so in that context, things can also get really confusing.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.224
So if you want to talk about the family that you live with,

00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:29.756
then you could say something like: 

00:10:29.756 --> 00:10:31.756
We're a family of five.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.756
I live here with my family.

00:10:33.756 --> 00:10:35.330
We're a family of five.

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:38.676
But if you're talking about the family that you grew up in,

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:42.000
then you need to clarify, you need to say:

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.745
I grew up in a family of five.

00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:48.767
Now that information is pretty general, it could be

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:51.193
a single parent and four kids,

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:54.496
or it could be two parents and three kids

00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:56.230
it's pretty loose.

00:10:56.496 --> 00:10:59.454
If you have children that you wanna talk about, say:

00:10:59.454 --> 00:11:02.242
I have a seven year old son.

00:11:02.668 --> 00:11:04.402
I'm a single parent.

00:11:04.402 --> 00:11:06.801
I'm a mother of twins.

00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:09.785
And it's really nice to add a little bit commentary around

00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:13.009
family members, just to make it a bit more interesting.

00:11:13.142 --> 00:11:14.344
You could say:

00:11:14.344 --> 00:11:18.419
 I’m a single mum. I’ve got twin girls, they’re five years old. 

00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:21.278
And they just started school this year, so it's been

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:22.865
pretty exciting for us!

00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:25.959
And the reason why adding just a little bit of this type of

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:27.696
information is so great,

00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:30.574
is because it gives hints and clues

00:11:30.574 --> 00:11:33.505
to the person that you're talking to to help them continue

00:11:33.505 --> 00:11:36.000
the conversation in a really positive way.

00:11:36.436 --> 00:11:38.170
You know they could ask:

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.984
What school are they going to?

00:11:39.984 --> 00:11:42.170
Or maybe comment and say:

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.202
You know,

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.872
now that they're at school, you must feel like you've got so much

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.621
time to yourself again!?

00:11:47.894 --> 00:11:48.867
Something like that.

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:52.171
When you're talking about your brothers and sisters, of course

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:54.969
you can say: I've got three sisters.

00:11:55.395 --> 00:11:58.938
But it's a bit of a mouthful to say:

00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:01.231
I've got two brothers and three sisters.

00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:06.000
Right? So instead, we use the word siblings to talk about

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.170
brothers and sisters, it's quite general.

00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:11.516
Two brothers and a sister

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.745
would equal three siblings.

00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:17.038
I have three siblings.

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.703
Now when you say that,

00:12:19.703 --> 00:12:21.703
it doesn't include you.

00:12:21.703 --> 00:12:25.033
Okay you're talking about the other children in your family.

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:26.807
If you want to include you, say:

00:12:26.807 --> 00:12:30.305
I am one of four siblings.

00:12:30.571 --> 00:12:34.938
And if you've got no siblings, then you're an only child.

00:12:35.124 --> 00:12:36.725
I'm an only child.

00:12:36.938 --> 00:12:40.534
You might also want to talk about your extended family.

00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:44.991
Now this is a really, really great expression to use

00:12:44.991 --> 00:12:49.210
when you're talking about aunties, uncles, grandparents, cousins.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.738
By saying extended family, you're including all of them,

00:12:53.738 --> 00:12:56.842
you don't have to go into detail about who and how many,

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.337
and all of that kind of thing.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.678
I live in Perth, but most of my extended family lives in Melbourne. 

00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:06.998
But saying extended family means you don't need to list out

00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:08.173
everyone, right?

00:13:08.173 --> 00:13:11.804
So you might want to talk about interests or hobbies

00:13:11.804 --> 00:13:14.895
things that you do outside of work.

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:18.385
We'll talk about work in a second so don't jump ahead.

00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:21.688
But to talk about hobbies, you might say: I enjoy

00:13:22.273 --> 00:13:25.178
with a noun. I enjoy baking.

00:13:25.364 --> 00:13:28.162
Don't say: I enjoy to bake.

00:13:28.162 --> 00:13:32.503
Right? Enjoy as a verb is always followed by a noun

00:13:32.503 --> 00:13:34.506
and this is a gerund, okay?

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:37.810
You can always say I like or I love

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.364
with a noun. So I love playing football, for example.

00:13:42.683 --> 00:13:46.465
But the verbs like and love, they can be followed by a gerund

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:50.034
or the verb infinitive and the meaning stays the same.

00:13:50.034 --> 00:13:54.000
So you can also say: I love to play football.

00:13:54.186 --> 00:13:56.585
The meaning is exactly the same.

00:13:56.931 --> 00:14:00.820
You could say: I'm really into something.

00:14:00.953 --> 00:14:03.751
And this is a really great, a really natural way

00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:05.804
of talking about the things that you like.

00:14:06.309 --> 00:14:08.309
I'm really into jazz music.

00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:13.129
Now having a couple of interesting things to include about yourself

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:18.000
in your introduction is so useful in lots of different contexts.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.691
If you've ever been part of an English class or some other meeting,

00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:24.409
where you've got to meet people for the first time,

00:14:24.728 --> 00:14:28.431
then the teacher will often suggest let's go around the room

00:14:28.431 --> 00:14:30.431
and you'll need to introduce yourself.

00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:31.926
Tell us your name,

00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:35.834
where you're from and something interesting about yourself.

00:14:38.448 --> 00:14:41.725
It's always good to have something ready to answer this question

00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:45.534
maybe you've got a special talent or an interesting hobby

00:14:45.534 --> 00:14:49.689
or a unique achievement that you can share in the situation.

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:52.567
And a fun way of introducing this it to say:

00:14:52.753 --> 00:14:56.802
One thing you may not know about me is

00:14:56.802 --> 00:15:00.444
One thing you may not know about me is I love to have dinner

00:15:00.444 --> 00:15:04.415
parties and I'll spend whole days preparing and organising

00:15:04.415 --> 00:15:06.415
themed events for my friends.

00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:09.825
So I'm curious to hear your ideas about this.

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:12.862
See if you can finish the rest of this sentence

00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:14.862
down in the comments below.

00:15:15.128 --> 00:15:18.884
One thing you may not know about me is...

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:22.853
Of course, you might want to talk about your job, right?

00:15:22.853 --> 00:15:26.449
So when you're talking about your job, when you're talking about

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:30.311
your job in your introduction, usually you're just sharing

00:15:30.577 --> 00:15:34.253
what you do and maybe who you work for. And again,

00:15:34.253 --> 00:15:37.689
there are lots of different ways to talk about your work,

00:15:37.928 --> 00:15:39.928
the company, etcetera.

00:15:40.168 --> 00:15:43.044
But what we really want to do today is make sure you're doing it

00:15:43.044 --> 00:15:44.163
accurately.

00:15:44.163 --> 00:15:47.378
Prepositions and articles are really challenging to get right

00:15:47.378 --> 00:15:49.963
in this section, might be a little tricky so

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:54.000
I hope that you are definitely taking notes as we go and that

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.702
you're applying the information that I'm sharing now

00:15:57.702 --> 00:15:59.330
to your situation.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.048
Of course you could say: I am

00:16:02.766 --> 00:16:05.138
a or an and a job position.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.561
Your job position is a countable noun so this means

00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:11.628
you need to include an article.

00:16:11.628 --> 00:16:13.229
I’m a graphic designer

00:16:13.229 --> 00:16:14.857
I’m an engineer. 

00:16:15.229 --> 00:16:19.862
Just make sure you're not saying: I’m engineer. That's wrong, okay?

00:16:20.367 --> 00:16:25.240
And if there's only one of your role within your company, then

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.474
you definitely can use the definite article, the.

00:16:29.474 --> 00:16:32.770
Okay I talk more about definite and indefinite articles

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.081
up here in this video.

00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:35.855
But you could say

00:16:35.855 --> 00:16:40.861
I am the CEO of a tech company.

00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:44.728
Or I am the owner of a florist.  

00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:47.712
You could also talk really generally about the field

00:16:47.712 --> 00:16:51.601
or the industry that you work in by using in.

00:16:51.973 --> 00:16:53.973
I work in

00:16:54.212 --> 00:16:55.747
and the industry.

00:16:55.907 --> 00:16:57.693
I work in marketing.

00:16:57.693 --> 00:16:59.523
I work in construction.

00:16:59.523 --> 00:17:01.258
I work in design.

00:17:01.258 --> 00:17:04.802
Now if you wanna say which company employs you,

00:17:04.802 --> 00:17:10.382
then you can use either, at or for with the company name.

00:17:10.568 --> 00:17:12.563
So you might say: I work at Vogue.

00:17:12.563 --> 00:17:15.963
Or I work at an architecture firm.

00:17:15.963 --> 00:17:18.500
Or I work for the government.

00:17:18.926 --> 00:17:20.421
Do you work for yourself?

00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:22.926
Are you your own boss?

00:17:23.379 --> 00:17:27.224
Well in this case you could say: I work for myself.

00:17:27.437 --> 00:17:30.000
I'm self-employed.

00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:33.537
Or I run my own business.

00:17:33.723 --> 00:17:37.516
And here's a little hint. If you're unsure about how to talk about

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:41.192
your job in your industry, as it relates to your industry,

00:17:41.405 --> 00:17:44.938
then listen to others who are from your industry

00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:48.843
introduce themselves. Lots of TedTalks or lots of

00:17:48.843 --> 00:17:52.768
industry-relevant videos around where you can listen to people

00:17:52.768 --> 00:17:56.416
introduce themselves in that context and learn from them.

00:17:56.655 --> 00:18:00.837
You may want to talk about education or your qualifications

00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:02.837
in your introduction and this is

00:18:02.943 --> 00:18:05.858
most common in a professional context

00:18:05.858 --> 00:18:10.316
maybe in an interview or you know, a work context.

00:18:10.316 --> 00:18:13.599
And again, there's lots of different ways that you can do this.

00:18:13.599 --> 00:18:14.816
You could say:

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:18.572
I have a degree in with an industry.

00:18:18.572 --> 00:18:22.376
like architecture or design.

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:24.855
I have a degree in engineering.

00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:29.005
You can also say: I'm a qualified with your job title.

00:18:29.005 --> 00:18:30.336
I'm a qualified engineer.

00:18:30.336 --> 00:18:32.308
I'm a qualified architect.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.601
Now notice that I'm using the job title and not the industry there,

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:38.324
okay?

00:18:38.324 --> 00:18:40.920
Sounds similar to saying I'm an architect

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.234
but the difference is that the adjective qualified

00:18:45.234 --> 00:18:47.685
clarifies your status.

00:18:47.685 --> 00:18:51.813
Add it if it feels important to clarify given the context.

00:18:51.813 --> 00:18:54.478
Maybe in an interview it's relevant.

00:18:54.478 --> 00:18:58.966
But there's no need to tell someone at a party that you're

00:18:58.966 --> 00:19:03.341
a qualified engineer, alright? In that context, you would just say:

00:19:03.341 --> 00:19:04.543
I'm an engineer.

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:07.564
If you're studying at university now then some of

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.974
these expressions are gonna be really useful.

00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:12.958
I'm studying with the industry.

00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:16.448
I’m studying environmental science.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.314
Or it could also be the name of your degree as well.

00:19:19.314 --> 00:19:21.660
I’m studying applied science.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.425
I’m completing a PhD in 

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:29.393
and whatever the research area is, maybe it's public health.

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:31.952
I’m completing a PhD in Public Health.

00:19:31.952 --> 00:19:36.296
I’m in my final year of something degree.

00:19:36.402 --> 00:19:40.123
You know, I’m in my final year of an economics degree.  

00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:42.760
I’m nearing the end of my studies

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.315
is another way of expressing that.

00:19:45.315 --> 00:19:48.831
And maybe you're undertaking some less formal training.

00:19:49.097 --> 00:19:51.740
And that's totally cool as well, you might wanna say:

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.549
I’m currently taking an online course to upskill. 

00:19:55.549 --> 00:20:00.000
Or I'm doing an extra course to improve my skills

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.133
in that area, something like that.

00:20:02.532 --> 00:20:06.577
So by now you should have a whole list of dot point ideas

00:20:06.577 --> 00:20:10.145
that we can start to build your introduction around.

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:14.885
For me, we could say: I'm Australian. I live in Perth.

00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:18.466
I’m originally from Melbourne. Interests, hobbies.

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:20.779
I love swimming in the ocean every morning.

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:25.041
I’m a qualified English teacher. I teach on YouTube.

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:29.227
I’m interested in businesses and startups.

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:29.835
Great!

00:20:30.154 --> 00:20:32.154
Okay have you got your list ready too?

00:20:32.154 --> 00:20:36.392
If not, just hit pause now, pause the video, write out your list

00:20:36.392 --> 00:20:37.585
and then continue on.

00:20:37.798 --> 00:20:40.872
Because now we need to find a way to pull all of those ideas

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:44.355
together, okay? We want to make sure that your sentences

00:20:44.355 --> 00:20:47.299
flow together and that they sound really natural

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:50.124
as you speak or you say your introduction.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.817
And to do that we need to combine these ideas into some

00:20:53.817 --> 00:20:57.950
longer sentences and add a few grammatical words to help.

00:20:58.136 --> 00:21:02.463
Hi, I’m Emma. I was born in Melbourne and I grew up in

00:21:02.463 --> 00:21:05.478
various cities along the east coast of Australia.

00:21:05.478 --> 00:21:09.269
I’ve been living in Perth on the west coast of Australia

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:13.365
with my partner for the past four years and we absolutely love it,

00:21:13.365 --> 00:21:16.451
especially early morning ocean swims!

00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:20.967
I’m a qualified English teacher and I teach students online

00:21:20.967 --> 00:21:25.885
and I also have an interest in business and startups, as well.

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:28.861
One thing you may not know about me is that I teach

00:21:28.861 --> 00:21:32.406
millions of students each month on my YouTube channel.

00:21:32.406 --> 00:21:36.000
Now obviously you know that about me, but most people I meet

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.985
don’t so, it’s always an interesting conversation starter.

00:21:39.985 --> 00:21:43.211
This is the type of script that I want you to write now.

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:46.195
Alright, and once you've got it written down,

00:21:46.195 --> 00:21:48.713
make sure you share it down in the comments below

00:21:48.713 --> 00:21:52.345
so that I can give you some feedback and some corrections

00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:54.345
to help you improve it if you need it.

00:21:54.691 --> 00:21:57.541
The sooner you get your introduction written and shared

00:21:57.541 --> 00:22:01.507
down below, the better, the more likely I'll be to see it

00:22:01.507 --> 00:22:03.235
and be able to respond.

00:22:03.607 --> 00:22:07.560
I definitely love to see you each commenting and giving support

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.690
and constructive feedback to each other down in the comments

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.221
below. It's so helpful

00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:16.386
and it helps everyone to keep improving together. 

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:21.317
Now once you have your script prepared and reviewed,

00:22:21.317 --> 00:22:24.669
save it on your phone, make a recording of it,

00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:28.813
whatever it takes to just have it with you regularly okay?

00:22:28.813 --> 00:22:32.142
And you need to practise it out loud.

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:36.821
Alright? On a daily basis. Don't just read it, practise how it sounds,

00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:41.237
how it comes out of your mouth. This is going to help you to

00:22:41.716 --> 00:22:46.426
speak more naturally, feel more comfortable as you are saying

00:22:46.426 --> 00:22:49.810
the words and the sounds and connecting those things together.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.087
It's really, really important that you practise out loud

00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:55.619
daily until you nail this.

00:22:55.619 --> 00:23:00.269
But even before then, you know, start practising it in real English

00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:03.763
situations. It's probably not going to be perfect at first,

00:23:03.763 --> 00:23:08.727
but you will get better every time you put it into that context.

00:23:08.727 --> 00:23:13.344
And you put yourself into that situation or you hear that question:

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.770
Tell me about yourself.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.770
And you might freeze at first

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.752
but it's going to change over time, you know,

00:23:20.752 --> 00:23:24.159
you've prepared for this. You've got your answers ready.

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:27.969
You don't need to panic and that is the kind of headspace

00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:31.957
and feeling that you need to step into a conversation with.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:36.061
I hope this lesson was really practical, really useful for you.

00:23:36.274 --> 00:23:39.815
And if you’re ready to keep building your conversation skills and

00:23:39.815 --> 00:23:42.297
learn how to keep your conversation going

00:23:42.536 --> 00:23:44.508
after you’ve introduced yourself,

00:23:44.508 --> 00:23:48.001
well move along to this lesson right here where we'll practise

00:23:48.001 --> 00:23:51.521
some small talk conversation starters together.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.133
I'll see you in there!
