00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.000
Hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In this lesson, we're going to get down to business,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.440
knowing some of the idioms used in a professional

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.320
context is going to help you to sound more

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.080
relaxed and natural in the workplace.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.120
And of course, help you to understand what the heck

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.240
everyone else is talking about!

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.740
So today, I've got five useful idioms for you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.980
that are commonly used in a professional context

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.480
- a business context.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.740
And that means they're perfect and fantastic to use

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.080
in an interview as well, so stay tuned!

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.640
Now I always tell my students one of the best ways

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.560
to learn and remember English idioms

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.440
is to link them to a memory or an experience in your life.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.400
That way, when you think about the idiom

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.860
or you hear it somewhere

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.220
you connect it with the personal moment in your life

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.000
and experience.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.360
And when you think about the experience, it helps you to

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.860
think about the idiom as well.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440
Now you don't have to learn and remember

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.780
every idiom in English, but you should learn

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.640
some common ones that you can actually use

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.640
to talk about your life.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.460
I'm going to tell you a story.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.180
My first job out of university

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.780
was with a huge corporate company.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.700
I was an intern.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.460
I thought it was going to be photocopying and stapling

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460
and getting cups of tea for my boss.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.020
But at the time that I started, my department was really

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.160
understaffed.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.500
They just didn't have enough people to manage

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.440
the workload.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.840
So I really got thrown in the deep end.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.200
Within weeks of starting, I was writing reports and I was

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.940
making presentations to the management team

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.560
which was kind of cool but a bit scary.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.400
So in this idiom, the 'deep end' is referring to

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.800
the deepest part of a swimming pool

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.640
where often your feet can't touch the ground.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.200
So if someone throws you or pushes you into the pool,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.780
that's a bit of a shock, isn't it?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780
You can't feel the ground.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.280
So you're thrown in the deep end when you're

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.060
put into a new or a difficult situation

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.220
without any preparation.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.140
And this often happens in the workplace, doesn't it?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.180
Sarah's been so stressed lately. She started a new job

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.280
last month, but they've really thrown her in the deep end.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.300
I'm not afraid of being thrown in the deep end.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.580
I think it's the best way to learn!

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.380
Now I don't want to throw you in the deep end

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.360
on your first day, but

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.940
do you think you could make a presentation to the CEO

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.400
by the end of the week?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.600
A similar idiom is to be 'out of one's depth'

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.720
and it has a similar meaning because it's an

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.400
uncomfortable place.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.440
Again,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.320
thinking about the deep end of your swimming pool,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.780
your feet can't touch the ground and you have to swim

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.320
to keep yourself alive, right?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.580
My brother loves the company that he works for

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.240
but he feels a little out of his depth in the finance team.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.420
Now when you start a new job, maybe a new role or a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.920
position in your company

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.220
or you start working for a new company,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.520
it usually takes some time to learn the ropes.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.860
So this means to learn the basic tasks

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.880
that allow you to do your job well and efficiently.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.420
You know, like how to use the photocopier,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.340
how to use the company's email system,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.220
who to call if your computer won't start,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.320
who you report to

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.740
and which meetings you need to attend

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.740
- all of the simple things

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.540
take a week or two to get used to

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.240
when you start a new job.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.240
How's the new job?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.580
It's going well! I'm still learning the ropes,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.120
but my colleagues are really great.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.540
You'll also hear people say

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.620
"I'll show you the ropes"

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.480
which means that they'll show you how things

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.080
are done, the standard, normal way that things are done.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.720
So note that if a person has been working at their job

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.980
for over a month, this idiom isn't really relevant anymore

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.500
because they've already learnt the basic tasks

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.880
they need to do their job.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.100
Now, once you've had your job for a while,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.620
it might be time to focus on

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.020
climbing the corporate ladder.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.560
So this idiom talks about the progression of roles

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.320
through a career,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.880
starting with an entry-level job, an internship

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.760
or a position straight out of university.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.960
But over the years, you get promotions,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.460
you switch companies,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.460
you become known in your industry,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.320
you work your way up to better and better opportunities.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.700
You get paid more, you have more responsibilities,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.700
you'll be a manager and then one day

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.360
maybe even the CEO!

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.620
So this progression is called

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.720
'climbing the corporate ladder'

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.960
Tim climbed the corporate ladder quickly.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.940
He became a partner at the company

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
by the time he was 26.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.980
But James has never been

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.860
interested in climbing the corporate ladder.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.500
I feel inspired by women who climb the corporate ladder

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.460
and raise a family at the same time.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.420
Amazing!

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.260
People who think outside the box are usually

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
pretty valuable employees

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.420
because they think creatively and they solve problems

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.420
in non-standard ways.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.700
So they think outside or beyond the normal

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.020
or standard way of thinking which often leads

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.100
to really interesting, creative solutions to problems.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.660
We need to think outside the box

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.520
and find a different solution.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.280
Steve's probably the most creative guy on the team

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.820
- he's always thinking outside the box.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.400
Now in Australia, you'll often hear this expression as

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.280
'thinking outside the square'

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.840
It's the same thing.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.080
Are you the type of person

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.340
who thinks outside the square?

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.940
Last one, a 'steep learning curve'.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.140
Now this is a brilliant idiom to use

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.720
during a job interview

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.720
- so was the last one actually -

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.940
but this one is a brilliant idiom to use

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.460
during an interview or a speaking exam.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.740
So use it when you're reflecting or thinking about some

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.980
of the challenges that you've overcome in the past.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.120
So it could be relating to work or even life experiences.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.440
So it's used when someone has to learn something

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.220
really quickly, usually just by giving it a shot,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.660
by doing their best and then

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.900
learning from their mistakes.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.080
So using this idiom to describe an experience

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.480
that you've had helps to show that you're not afraid

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.020
of hard work or challenges and that you're willing

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.060
to build new skills and overcome problems.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.060
So it's a really handy one to have!

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.200
For many international students,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.320
studying in an English-speaking country can be a

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.180
steep learning curve.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.080
Going from employee to business owner

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.420
was a really steep learning curve for me!

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.220
It's still steep actually, I'm only about here!

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.360
So that's it! Six new business idioms for you.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.700
I'm sure that you can think of some others as well

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.700
that relate to jobs and business.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.040
So if you can, pop them in the comments below

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.180
and share them with everyone.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.140
And of course, I always, always love to see you

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.660
actually using the English that I teach you.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.980
So take a moment right now

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.820
to write a sentence using one of the idioms

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.940
that you've learned today and add it to the comments.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.580
I'll check it for you but you'll also get to see

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.550
how the idioms are being used in lots of different

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.420
examples from all of your peers.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.860
Once you do that, then come over here,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.220
keep practising with me. Try out this lesson here

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.220
or maybe even that one.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.400
Make sure you subscribe if you haven't

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.100
already subscribed, you'll get a new lesson

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.560
every single week.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.000
Bye for now!
