00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.400
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.240
You've probably taken some English classes

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.020
at some point already, right?

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.620
Maybe way back when you were at school

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.500
you might have tried traditional classroom lessons

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.760
even as an adult

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.800
but perhaps you've even tried some online lessons

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.200
as well. Whatever way you look at it,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.380
taking regular English lessons is a big deal.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.620
It usually costs money

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.140
and it takes up quite a bit of time.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.460
So I want to help you to get the most out of

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.980
your English classes.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.420
That's exactly what we're doing here today.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.900
In particular, I want to focus on

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.300
online language classes.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.520
So have you ever thought about taking English lessons

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.540
online or have you before?

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.820
Online classes in particular can offer more flexibility

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.180
and can also make your classes more affordable too.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
So as I said, today I want to give you some tips

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.900
to help you to prepare for your first online English lesson

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.740
but even if you've been taking online classes

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.840
for a while now, I still think that some of the tips

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.640
that I share today are going to be really helpful

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.740
to help you get more out of your lessons.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.680
Now I've got four important things that I want to

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.920
share with you today and the first one is relevant

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.700
even before you decide which course

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.360
or which class to take.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.700
And that is: Why are you taking this class?

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.500
Now I want you to think further than

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
"I need to improve my English."

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.880
Think more specifically than that.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.980
The more specific you can be, the more likely you are

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.540
to find the right classes, the right teacher

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.640
and get the results that you want.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.620
So ask yourself:

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.480
Are you learning English because you need it for a job?

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.600
Do you want to focus on your pronunciation?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.360
Do you want to try and understand a specific

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.060
English accent?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.060
Do you want to travel abroad?

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.180
Is that why you're learning?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.560
You want to go to an English-speaking country.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.020
Or maybe you're planning on sitting an IELTS

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.740
or a TOEFL exam.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.220
In fact, tell me in the comments right now

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.200
if you were to take an online English class,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.120
what type of class would you be looking for?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.700
You see if you're planning to live or travel abroad,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.280
then conversational English, travel vocabulary

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.560
these types of things are going to be really, really

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.580
critical for you to learn.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.400
But if you need to improve your English skills

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.300
for your job, then business English classes

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.240
are going to be way more useful for you

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.280
than general English classes.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.540
Maybe you just found out that you're

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.120
going to present your work

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.760
at an international conference

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.520
and you really need to improve and focus on your verbal

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.740
communication skills. If you're planning to sit an exam,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.020
well, of course you need to practise all of your skills.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.820
But it is so powerful to study with a teacher

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.880
who can help you to understand

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.500
and to practise the format of the exam.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.900
So having a really clear answer to this question

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.560
is going to get you the best results.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.740
Get tech-savvy and organised.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.140
So tech-savvy means that you understand technology

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.700
not that you're some kind of guru but

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.680
you know we're talking about online classes here

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.120
so, of course, you need to be at least

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.780
a little tech savvy, right?

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.100
If you've never joined an online class before,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.640
you need to spend some time understanding

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.320
the software that you need to use to connect.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.000
You need to download it, you need to test it

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.140
before the time of your class

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.520
and even though this sounds really, really simple,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.900
I can't tell you how many times

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.100
students of mine have been trying to join my classes

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.960
after it started

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.100
and if it's a group class, the teacher may not be able

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.220
to stop the class

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.680
and try and help you with your technical problems.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.800
And if it's a one-on-one class, well,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.220
then you're just losing the time that you've paid for.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.660
So my advice is to put in a few minutes, yes

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.740
that's all it really takes,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.360
so that you know how to join the classes

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.660
when the time comes.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.280
Alright, so excited about my Spanish class!

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.760
It says my video's not working.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.540
I plugged it in.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.880
There we go.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.740
Hola!

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.940
Can't you hear me?

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.640
My microphone's not working.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.780
How do you change the settings?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.600
Where are my headphones?

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.880
I left them downstairs.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.800
Hola?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.420
Hola!

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.180
Alright, can you see where I'm going with this?

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.180
Just get yourself organised before your first class.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.540
And one more note about technology.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.840
Although it's really, really handy to be able to join

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.180
your class from anywhere on your phone,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.200
it's really hard to see the screen.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.260
So if your teacher's using a digital whiteboard and

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.080
or maybe even asking you to read a document,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.500
it's going to be hard to do that on your phone.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.660
So using your phone should be a last resort.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.820
Joining an online class from your computer is always

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.280
going to give you a better experience.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.700
Tip number three. Take notes.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.820
Now I know this is a really obvious thing to do

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.320
in an offline classroom, in a normal classroom

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.340
but I feel like I really need to make a point about this

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.020
for online classes.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.820
Online classes are great. You know that I'm a fan.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.800
I take my Spanish classes online with Lingoda

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.540
and I rave about my classes all the time.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.100
They're affordable, it's flexible,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.700
I can choose a time that suits me.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.680
In fact, I really recommend Lingoda,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.760
I'm going to leave a link

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.040
in the description so you can check them out.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.140
They teach English classes as well.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.980
But online classes can be so flexible,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.600
sometimes we're a little too relaxed about it,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.260
you know we forget the basics.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.560
You need to have a place that is quiet

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.560
and calm to do your lessons

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.080
and you need to be able to take notes.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.340
So if you're joining your class from your computer,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.260
you'll be able to take notes on your computer but

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.440
just be aware that if you are typing on a laptop,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.600
it can actually be really noisy

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.680
and distracting for everyone else.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.400
And if you're joining from your phone,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.780
you can't take notes anywhere

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.100
so you need to be somewhere where you can write.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.980
Now I don't need to tell you why taking notes

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.220
during your English classes is a good idea.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.460
You know why.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.800
But I do want to remind you that you create

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.840
the environment for your online classes okay.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.100
When you go to a school into a classroom,

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.040
it's quiet, you don't have any distractions,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.440
you have a clean desk to work at

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.180
and it helps you to stay focused on your lesson.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.800
You might have workbooks, things like that.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.960
Take this same respect with you

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.080
into your online classes and you will thrive,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.640
but you're in charge.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.500
Definitely come prepared with questions

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.840
or things that you want to work on during your lesson.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.160
You assume that when you go to an English class,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.720
that the teacher is going to be there

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.220
to guide you through, right?

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.940
You can sit back and relax. And you can do that right

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.160
but coming to the class with really clear priorities

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.220
and questions will help your teacher

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.320
to give you what you want from your lessons.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.600
So you're preparing for your first online class.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.440
Now if you're meeting a tutor one-to-one

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.680
then this is a golden opportunity for you.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.400
Tell them what the challenges you're having

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.540
with your English are.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.200
Help them to help you, okay? If you tell your teacher

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.880
what you're struggling with, then they will likely

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.320
gather materials for the next class

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.680
so that you can practise

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.520
working on those things together.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.020
But if you don't mention anything well, that's fine,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.300
but then you can't really be frustrated if

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.100
they never helped you to master articles

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.980
because you didn't tell them that that was a priority

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.440
for you. They might focus on something else.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.260
If you and your teacher work together as a team,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.400
then you're going to go

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.340
so much further with your classes.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.560
Now if you're joining a group class online,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.920
you may not be able to get as much

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920
personalised attention

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.960
but there will probably be times when the class

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.660
finishes a little early

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.340
and you can jump in and use the opportunity

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.720
to get one of your questions answered.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.620
So that's my advice as an online English teacher

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.200
but now I want yours. I'm sure you've had some

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.000
experiences with online English classes.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.100
In fact, if you've got any advice that can help

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.520
others who've never tried it before

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.840
how can they make their first online English class

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.780
awesome?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.120
I've tried quite a few different online language

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.760
platforms and for me it's really important

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.980
to have contact

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.020
with a native teacher.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.760
That's why I've really enjoyed my group classes

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.920
with Lingoda

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.560
but if you've tried any other platforms or other types

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.620
of online classes, then I'd love to hear about it

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.780
in the comments. Let me know down there.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.900
And make sure you hit that subscribe button too.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.240
Come back next week

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.960
for another mmmEnglish lesson

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.340
but in the meantime, you can keep yourself

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.500
busy with these ones.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.400
I'll see you in there!
