00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.138
Hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:07.506
Have you&nbsp;ever been in a situation where you've met

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:12.569
someone for the very first time but you said&nbsp;something that

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:14.800
must have been inappropriate.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.779
You felt that tension, that awkwardness.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.610
I mean when&nbsp;you meet someone new, you really don't

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.032
have a lot of time to make a good first impression, do you?

00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:27.383
So today I'm gonna highlight six things that you just

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:30.583
should never say in a first time conversation

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.857
and we're going to look at some alternatives to make sure that you

00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:35.672
do look good

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:39.262
and make&nbsp;a first good impression in that conversation.

00:00:39.464 --> 00:00:43.365
Remember to like this video, give it&nbsp;a thumbs up, hit that subscribe

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:46.793
button, that way I know exactly what videos you&nbsp;love

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.640
and I can keep making more for you.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.098
In this video today, we're going to be&nbsp;talking about relaxed

00:00:58.098 --> 00:01:02.080
friendly conversations, ones that take place every day

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.000
at work, at school, at universities

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.315
but these are also the places where we feel most intimidated

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:13.498
and nervous&nbsp;because we may be trying to impress someone

00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:17.009
or you know, perhaps it's a more formal context.

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.680
So as I'm sharing these different expressions

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.294
throughout the video, pay close attention to&nbsp;the tone,

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:28.626
the intonation and the way that I'm expressing these thoughts.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:32.663
It's so important, you&nbsp;could say the exact words

00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:37.078
that I'm telling you to say but if your delivery is a little off

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.000
well then&nbsp;it can easily get misinterpreted or misunderstood.

00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:45.327
Make sure you try and repeat each sentence&nbsp;after me,

00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:47.807
try to imitate the way that I say it.

00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:51.788
Ask yourself: Where's the word stress here or

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:55.744
am&nbsp;I using a soft tone or am I being really direct?

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:59.767
I'll explain more about it as we go&nbsp;but let's get started.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.716
Our first one is

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.591
when someone asks you if you like your job

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.233
or you&nbsp;enjoy what you do.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.576
So in that situation, do not say:

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.961
My work is so boring.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.689
I can't stand the people I&nbsp;work with.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.035
When you first meet someone, avoid being negative

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:24.531
about your place of work. Don't complain&nbsp;about your job,

00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:29.538
your boss or your colleagues, even if really you don't like it.

00:02:29.538 --> 00:02:31.280
I know you&nbsp;might be thinking:

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.687
Emma, I'm just being honest.

00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:40.565
But complaining like that really only reflects poorly&nbsp;on you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.374
and studies show that you know if you say something negative,

00:02:44.374 --> 00:02:47.704
the person that you're having&nbsp;a conversation with will associate

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.730
that negativity with you 

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.129
and not the actual situation that you're&nbsp;talking about

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:56.261
and you don't want that when you first meet them, right?

00:02:56.357 --> 00:03:01.075
So instead, you could start&nbsp;by saying something positive like:

00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:05.338
There are some aspects of my job that I really enjoy 

00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:09.054
but&nbsp;I have to admit, I'm finding it difficult to

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.107
work with a colleague,

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.843
get along with my boss,

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:15.922
feel excited about the work that I'm doing.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.624
These are much better alternatives.

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:20.356
Number two.

00:03:21.198 --> 00:03:23.141
How much money do you make?

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.274
And how much rent do you pay?

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:28.969
Do you know what, in&nbsp;some cultures,

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.889
this question is totally okay to ask

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.245
but for people who come from places like the&nbsp;US, the UK

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:39.824
and here in Australia, it's not okay.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.182
People would be quite taken aback if you&nbsp;ask that question

00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:46.213
especially if you've only just met them.

00:03:46.213 --> 00:03:50.331
It could make them feel quite&nbsp;uncomfortable and there really isn't

00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:54.854
a way to tactfully ask this question. It's actually&nbsp;better to just

00:03:54.854 --> 00:03:56.599
avoid it completely.

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:57.798
However

00:03:57.798 --> 00:04:00.296
if you do really need to know this information

00:04:00.296 --> 00:04:04.979
for some specific reason then make it an indirect question

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.828
to make it more polite.

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:11.736
If you don't&nbsp;mind me asking, how much do you pay for rent?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.370
Number three.

00:04:14.714 --> 00:04:16.744
You're nicer than I thought you'd be.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.872
If you've heard about someone before you met&nbsp;them

00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:24.421
or maybe you've seen them somewhere before

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.319
well you might think that that's a really

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.217
great way to start a conversation,

00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:31.170
that&nbsp;it's a way of paying a compliment.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.290
And let me tell you why.

00:04:35.596 --> 00:04:39.729
Because it implies&nbsp;or suggests that you thought the person

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.514
was mean before or the opposite of&nbsp;whatever you said

00:04:43.514 --> 00:04:44.753
so if you said:

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.629
You're so much prettier than I thought you'd be.

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.102
It kind of suggests that you thought they were ugly,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.109
it's not a good way to start a conversation.

00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:57.741
If you&nbsp;want to pay someone a compliment then just

00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:00.279
keep it simple and say it straight.

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.293
You're a lovely person.

00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:03.957
You're so kind.

00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:06.180
That way there's no confusion.

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:08.122
All right. Number four.

00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:11.736
Sarah is really lazy.

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:16.826
I&nbsp;mean this applies to any negative comment about

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:20.218
a colleague or a friend or a classmate.

00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:24.320
When you meet&nbsp;someone for the first time, you might point out

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.432
friends or colleagues, other people in the office

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:30.000
and share some information about these people.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.519
But like I mentioned before, when you are gonna say

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.555
something negative about someone,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.349
that negativity just reflects on you

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.133
right? Even if you're talking&nbsp;about someone else

00:05:43.554 --> 00:05:46.170
it just makes you sound

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.975
not very nice yourself.

00:05:48.243 --> 00:05:52.293
So instead of saying that Sarah&nbsp;is lazy, you could say:

00:05:52.293 --> 00:05:54.535
We're all quite hard workers

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.497
some work a bit harder than others.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.121
Notice I'm not saying any specific names?

00:06:02.384 --> 00:06:03.615
Okay next one.

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:05.409
You look so tired!

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.940
You look so fat&nbsp;today!

00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:12.194
Now in some countries implying someone is fat is okay 

00:06:12.194 --> 00:06:14.383
because it signifies wealth

00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:19.061
but in&nbsp;other countries including most English-speaking countries,

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:22.762
it's really inappropriate to highlight&nbsp;someone's appearance

00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:24.218
in a negative way.

00:06:24.447 --> 00:06:25.657
There's no

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:27.822
say this instead here right?

00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:31.518
If you notice&nbsp;that someone has put on a little bit of weight

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.841
don't mention it at all.

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.758
If you think&nbsp;someone's pregnant, don't say anything.

00:06:38.386 --> 00:06:42.495
It's just safer to wait and avoid hurting&nbsp;their feelings

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:44.066
especially if you're wrong.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.541
This reminds me of a time when I felt a little&nbsp;embarrassed

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:52.453
and awkward in a conversation that I was having with someone

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:57.169
because I asked&nbsp;an older woman if she had any children.

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.327
She said no

00:06:59.474 --> 00:07:04.690
but left the answer hanging there and&nbsp;I instantly felt

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.360
bad and uncomfortable because

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.361
you just don't know when you ask this question.

00:07:10.647 --> 00:07:14.436
Had she tried to have children and she couldn't?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.258
Maybe she wanted to but she never found the&nbsp;right person.

00:07:19.252 --> 00:07:20.633
You know or something else.

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:24.367
And after the awkward silence, she said:

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:28.238
I know what&nbsp;you're thinking. Everyone always thinks that

00:07:28.713 --> 00:07:32.598
but I'm really happy. I chose not to have&nbsp;children.

00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:34.560
I really love my life.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.811
That's also

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.474
another example of a type of question that&nbsp;maybe

00:07:40.474 --> 00:07:44.183
is not always appropriate to ask when you first meet someone.

00:07:44.183 --> 00:07:48.581
You just don't know&nbsp;everyone's stories, the background, right?

00:07:49.117 --> 00:07:51.519
Whether or not you are upsetting them

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.587
or making them feel uncomfortable.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.233
In that case, fortunately it was just me&nbsp;feeling uncomfortable

00:07:57.233 --> 00:07:58.923
and I learnt a lesson.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.588
Okay so if you do meet someone for the first time

00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:05.593
and they look tired and you want to comment on it

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.098
well you could first start by making a comment&nbsp;about yourself

00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:11.244
and say:

00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:16.019
I really struggled to sleep last night.. how did you sleep?

00:08:17.186 --> 00:08:22.175
So this is&nbsp;more indirect and they'll be inclined to open up a little

00:08:22.175 --> 00:08:24.075
rather than getting defensive.

00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:27.743
So if&nbsp;you're sharing that you didn't get a lot of sleep

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.720
you might then allow them to say:

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.929
Oh gosh I haven't slept for days!

00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:36.695
And it's probably then that you could say:

00:08:37.307 --> 00:08:41.332
Yeah, you look&nbsp;a little tired, you look exhausted.

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:43.625
How old are you?

00:08:43.912 --> 00:08:47.424
Now in some cultures, this&nbsp;question is actually really important 

00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:51.259
so that you know how to address the person that&nbsp;you're talking to.

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.104
You need to use a certain

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.902
pronoun to show respect but this is not the case&nbsp;in English.

00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:02.687
Our pronouns are more neutral so the question about age is

00:09:02.687 --> 00:09:07.021
really uncommon. In fact, it's&nbsp;unnecessary

00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:10.600
which is why it can make people feel a little uncomfortable

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.492
especially if you ask it&nbsp;during your very first

00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:15.194
conversation with someone

00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:19.652
because there's no benefit&nbsp;to you knowing it apart from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.487
potentially judging them in some way.

00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:26.776
It's just&nbsp;another question that you should probably avoid

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.821
but if you do have to ask and not in the first&nbsp;conversation

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:35.272
but maybe in a later conversation then again,

00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:37.931
try making it an indirect question.

00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:41.236
If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.866
It's much more polite and it gives them the&nbsp;space to choose

00:09:44.866 --> 00:09:46.762
not to say anything.

00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.137
So I hope you enjoyed this lesson and that it helped you to&nbsp;learn

00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:55.418
a few new ways to express yourself during your first meetings

00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:58.164
and first encounters with new&nbsp;people that you meet.

00:09:58.757 --> 00:10:02.296
And look, if you have done some of these things before 

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:05.397
don't worry about it&nbsp;at all, we all have.

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:07.301
It's not the end of the world.

00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:10.301
And if you're ready to keep your conversation&nbsp;practice going

00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:14.142
