00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.960
Well hey there! I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.020
and in this lesson, we're talking about cash!

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Moollah. Big ones. Bucks.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.640
Quid. Dosh. Dough.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.780
Coin. Money.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.380
Now, most countries have their own currency

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.320
- the name for their money.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.300
So dollars, pounds, euros, yen, rupee,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.560
dirham, renminhbi, dong.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.140
In fact,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.420
can you do me a favour and write the name of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.000
your country's currency

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.180
in the comments below this video?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm curious to see just how many currencies

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.620
we can collect down there.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.600
But currency is not what this lesson is about.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.780
This lesson is about the nouns, the verbs,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.540
the adjectives that we use to talk about money

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.760
in English and there are plenty!

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.220
The thing about money is,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.240
it's a pretty dang important part of life really, isn't it?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.340
So it's no wonder at all why we have

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.280
so many different words to talk about money

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.140
including plenty of slang words.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.020
Plenty more than I've listed here.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.320
And these words are often unique to a place

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320
or to a community.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560
They may not be understood

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.720
by all native English speakers

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.420
or even used by all native English speakers.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300
So if you're visiting an English-speaking country,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.560
do a little research before you arrive

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.980
because you'll hear 'quid' and 'skint' in England

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.600
but they're not commonly used here in Australia.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.740
We would probably say 'bucks' and 'broke' instead,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.720
which is a little more like Americans.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.840
So when you're in an English-speaking country,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.460
make sure you're listening out for these words.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.760
Listen for the way that local people talk about money.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
Now the noun 'money' is a universal word, you can use it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.820
anywhere in an English-speaking country.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.080
In Australia, you'll hear people use any of these words

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.720
to refer to money and more of them.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.200
But the most common ones are bucks, cash,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.220
coin and of course, money.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.640
One of the trickiest

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.920
things about money words in English

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.540
is how they are used

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.180
because dollars and bucks are countable nouns.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.760
So if you have more than one,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.220
it must be plural.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.520
Make sure you check your pronunciation on that,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.420
it's very common for English learners

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.080
to drop the plural 'S' and say "five dollar"

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.220
which is incorrect, "five dollars".

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.160
Now, 'bucks' is just an informal casual word for dollars.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.680
It's a synonym.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.320
Can I borrow ten bucks?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.400
It has exactly the same meaning as

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.380
"Can I borrow ten dollars?"

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.360
It's just more informal.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.460
And often 'bucks' is used as a bit of a

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.060
sales or marketing tool

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.120
because somehow 'bucks' makes things sound cheaper

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.760
or less expensive.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.660
It's only twenty bucks! Let's get it..

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.180
What? Twenty dollars? I'm not paying that.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.360
No.. it's only twenty bucks. It's nothing!

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.960
So this is exactly the same amount

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.160
but using 'bucks' makes it sound cheaper somehow.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.000
So it's a good sales tool.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.460
'Cents' and 'coins' are also countable nouns

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.460
relating to money.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.400
Do you have any coins? I need them to pay for parking.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.300
Sorry, I've only got fifty cents.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.400
Now, 'quid' is countable

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.140
but it doesn't have a plural form.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.940
It'll cost you a quid.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.840
Can you lend me twenty quid?

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.420
There is no plural sound.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.980
Now when you think about money like this,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.440
it's easy to see how it's countable, right?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.760
We know exactly how many dollars and cents

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.160
we have in the bank.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.240
So of course money is countable, right?

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.960
But actually, some English nouns that refer to money

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.940
are uncountable

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.800
and this has a huge impact

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.720
when you're using these words in English sentences.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.600
So to find out more about that,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.460
check out this lesson I made about uncountable nouns

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.180
but right now, we'll continue talking about

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.540
uncountable nouns relating to money, okay?

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.180
'Money' is an uncountable noun and 'cash' is a synonym.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.980
It's also an uncountable noun which means

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.380
that they have only one form.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.340
There is no plural form.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.800
We would never say 'monies' or 'cashes'.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.000
Did you bring any money for the tickets?

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.140
I haven't got enough money to pay for lunch. Sorry.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.660
Now, this is interesting!

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.000
Once an amount gets over a thousand,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.660
you'll notice people saying 'grand' or 'K'

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.520
and this just means thousand.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.140
So this is quite common across

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.540
all English-speaking countries.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.640
He earned 80K in three months.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.420
We borrowed fifty grand from my parents

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.000
to put a deposit on a house.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.540
So that's fifty thousand dollars.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.940
Now some nouns in English can be

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.040
countable and uncountable.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.980
'Coin' is like this.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.960
Coins are countable, you can see

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.400
I've got several of them right here.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.160
Now this is the common use of 'coin', right?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360
There are several coins here

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.780
but 'coin' can also be used informally

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.820
as a synonym for money.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.400
She must be on some good coin.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.080
They've just bought a new house!

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.300
So this means she must be making lots of money.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.740
"She's on good coin" not "She's on good coins"

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.400
Okay so let's talk about some verbs to use

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.180
when you're talking about money in English.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.300
So when you go to work,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.120
you earn money, don't you?

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.020
Have you ever wondered how much

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.020
money someone else earns?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.380
Some people are much better at

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.640
saving money than others, right?

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.340
Some people spend their money straightaway

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.460
as soon as they get it

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.800
and then they have to

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.540
borrow money from their friends and family.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.620
Do you know anyone like that?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.220
When you borrow money from a bank,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.740
you take out a loan.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.080
So the bank loans you money,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.780
when you don't have enough.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.640
So notice here that 'loan' can be a verb and also a noun.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.880
But the problem is that then you owe the bank money.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.220
I hate the feeling of owing someone money.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.020
I always try to repay that money as quickly as possible.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.780
When you loan money from the bank,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.280
you have to repay the money, right?

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.300
With interest.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.140
So if you don't blow all your money

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.140
as soon as you get it.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.480
That's just an informal way of saying

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.700
"Spend all your money."

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.620
So if you don't blow all your money as soon as you get it,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.640
you may be able to invest the money.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.780
And when someone, perhaps a relative, passes away

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.520
or they die, they might leave you some of their money.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.940
And when this happens, you inherit money.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.660
So the reality is that most things cost money, don't they?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.180
Not everything, but most things cost money.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.220
Goodness, there are lots and lots of different

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.100
verbs to use with 'money', aren't there?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.780
And also they can be used with the

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.780
synonyms of 'money', as well.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.600
Lots of collocations to try and remember.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.320
Let's talk about adjectives that you can use

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.600
when you're talking about money.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.000
So it's important to know that there are

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.060
different adjectives to use with things.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.020
So the things that you can buy with money and people.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.560
So that describes people's behaviour with money.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.760
So let's start with adjectives that describe things

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.480
that people can buy.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.580
So of course, you're probably used to the adjective,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.700
'expensive', when something costs a lot of money, right?

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.700
And 'cheap',

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.280
when something doesn't cost a lot of money.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.800
But I want to introduce you to a few other words,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.200
other adjectives.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.180
I want to push your vocabulary a bit further today.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.180
So I want you to think about a situation

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.180
where you bought something in the past

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.080
and you were happy with the price.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.800
It wasn't a cheap item but you were happy

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.120
to pay the price.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.020
In your opinion, the value that you get

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.020
is equal to the cost.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.700
The benefit of the item

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.020
is equal to the amount that you will pay for it.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.620
So then, you can say "it's worth it."

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.020
We paid more for the house than we wanted to,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.060
but it's worth it. It's in a beautiful location.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.640
You might also say that the price was fair or reasonable

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.720
but if something costs more than you think it's worth,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.420
you could say that "it's pricey."

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.940
I almost bought a new sofa today but I decided

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.160
it was too pricey.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.580
I'll keep looking for one that's a little cheaper.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.720
Now the adjective 'cheap' is not always a positive one.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.380
It can suggest that something is poorly-made,

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.400
that the quality is bad.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.120
So if you want to say that something is cheap

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.440
but express it in a more positive way,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.740
you could use 'affordable' or 'economical'.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.560
We need more affordable housing options in the city.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.920
Catching a bus to Thailand

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.200
is more economical than flying.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.480
That's a positive way to express 'cheaper'.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.320
So how can we describe people and their money?

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.920
You probably know someone who is

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.020
generous with the money that they have.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.240
They share it with everyone around them.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.240
They're generous.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.380
Now if someone has a lot of money, you could say

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.220
"They're rolling in it."

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.480
As in they're rolling in money. They've got lots of it!

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.480
Another common one, "They're loaded"

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.700
or even "They've got heaps of coin."

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.200
Now if someone doesn't have much money,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.760
you might hear

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.180
"They're broke" or "They're skint"

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.320
So 'broke' is common in Australia and in America,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.740
'skimp' is commonly used in the UK

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.160
but both being that someone doesn't have

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.820
much money or any money.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200
I'm completely broke.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.760
Now if you know someone who doesn't

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.460
like to spend their money,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.860
you could say "they're tight" or "a cheapskate".

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.120
Now these are both insults, they're not kind words.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.740
So don't use them to talk about your friends

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.600
unless you're joking around.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.180
My boss is so tight, he cancelled our Christmas party

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.540
because there were too many people to invite.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.340
So if you don't mean to insult someone

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.800
and you're suggesting that it's a good thing

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.500
that they don't spend their money, then instead

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.780
use a different adjective like

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.860
'thrifty' or 'money-conscious'.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.200
My auntie is thrifty with her money,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.260
she doesn't earn much but she lives comfortably.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.460
Now if someone doesn't like to spend money,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.320
that's not necessarily a bad thing, is it?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.200
Sometimes that's a really positive quality.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.540
So I've introduced a lot of new words

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.060
throughout this lesson. Lots of words to do with money.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.700
What I suggest you do, is take a few moments

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.520
to write a paragraph right now.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.460
Write about the people in your life who suit

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.360
these adjectives or things you've done with the verbs

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.400
that we talked about earlier.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.780
Do you know someone who's loaded

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.040
or someone who's thrifty?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.580
Tell me about it in the comments.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.860
Practise using these words in sentences.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.180
I really hope that you enjoyed this lesson.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.320
Money is something that we

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.600
all talk about a lot, don't we?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.060
So I hope that you learned some new ways

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.860
to express yourself today.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.780
