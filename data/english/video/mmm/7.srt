00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.180
Sorry, I'm late.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.980
My phone ran of battery, I wanted to call.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.940
No, no questions, I'm pretty keen to get out of here.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.209
This is really important.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.280
Might just take this. Do you mind?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.700
Hello? Oh hi mum!

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.820
Hello, I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.900
Today we're going to be talking about

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.740
going to a job interview.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.420
Now if you've ever done this before,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.120
I want you to think of one word that describes

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.460
the experience, an adjective,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.400
just one that summarises the experience

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.300
of going to an interview.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.900
Or maybe you can share an emoji

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.580
that summarises the experience.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.080
The interview is just like a conversation but there's the

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.520
added pressure of being professional,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.080
saying all of the things that your future employer

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.480
wants to hear

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.420
and of course, doing all of this while being

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.820
true to yourself and authentic.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.280
So doing all of this is stressful enough

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100
in your own native language

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.880
but doing it in your second language must take things

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.140
to a whole new level

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.940
But the tips that I'm sharing today are really relevant

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.500
to anyone who's preparing for a job or for an interview.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.400
Now, of course planning and practice

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.360
helps you to prepare for an interview.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.900
It's excellent to have an idea

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.700
of what you're ggoing to say but in an interview,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.420
there are also plenty of things to steer clear of, right?

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.380
There are plenty of things that you definitely

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.160
shouldn't say or do.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.340
Today, we're going to talk about three of the worst

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.780
things that you can possibly say or do

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.260
when you go to an English interview.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.080
We're going to talk a little bit about

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.780
your interview strategy and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.940
practise some phrases that you can use to make a really

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.280
good impression.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.840
Last call everyone.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.940
This is an important announcement

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.500
from our good friends at Lingoda who want you to know

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.700
that due to high demand,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.460
the deadline to register for the upcoming

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.240
Language Marathon has been extended

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.140
to the 19th of September which is next week.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.780
So the Lingoda Marathon is your chance to speak

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.000
English or German or Spanish or French

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.160
more fluently in just three months.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.880
Plus, if you finish the Marathon, you can earn up to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.080
a hundred percent of your money back.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.920
So what is the Marathon? What's it like and is it worth it?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.060
Well if you're a regular viewer here at mmmEnglish,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.540
you'll know that I took part in the Marathon

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.480
back in May and it was one of the best things

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.260
that I ever did. With my hectic schedule,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.100
the main benefit for me was committing

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.980
to taking a Spanish class every single day

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.320
and of course, the motivation to keep showing up

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.020
for those classes because

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.120
I won't lie to you, the Marathon is tough.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.700
In fact, the hardest part of the Marathon

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.380
was that it really forced me to be organised,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.080
much more organised than I usually am

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.080
because you have to book your classes in advance,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.980
you can't just show up on the day

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.980
and at whatever time you feel like.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.200
If you've looked into the Marathon before,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.020
you'll know that they have small group class sizes,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.420
maximum of five students per class

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.720
and qualified native teachers who are really friendly

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.280
and with you every step of the way.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.260
What you may not know is that the entry rules

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.840
have changed a little.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.400
Now you can get full details on how the marathon works

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.740
what it costs by clicking on the link

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.600
in the description below.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.460
And if you make sure you use this code here

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.140
when you register, you'll be supporting mmmEnglish

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.980
and you'll also get a ten Euro discount

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.860
on your deposit too.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.600
So good luck!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.800
Alright, now I want to talk very quickly about the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.280
two roles that people play in an interview.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.580
The first is the person who is asking all of the questions

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.500
we call them the interviewer,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.560
the interviewer.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.080
And then there's the person receiving the questions

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.780
and answering them. We call them the interviewee.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.920
Okay, that's you, the interviewee.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.260
So when I interview a new teacher to join my team,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.480
I'm the interviewer and they are the interviewee.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.000
So you'll hear me use these words

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.820
throughout the lesson. So just

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.460
remember which one's which, okay?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.180
One of the worst things that you can

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.220
say or do in an interview is be apologetic,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.280
to be sorry about something that you just don't

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.280
need to be sorry about.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.760
Sorry, I'm late.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.780
Sorry, my English is really bad.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.460
Sorry, I'm feeling really nervous.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.200
I don't know. Sorry.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.600
And although being sorry is polite in many other

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.680
circumstances and being vulnerable and honest

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.040
about your feelings is also important sometimes

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.420
and even though the interviewer may understand,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.980
in English, using the word 'sorry'

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.040
changes the tone of a conversation and especially

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.180
in the context of an interview.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.040
It just adds a negative perspective to things

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.760
that you're talking about and it makes you look bad

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.000
or worse than you need to.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.080
So in an interview,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.960
any kind of apology really makes you seem

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.060
unsure of yourself, flustered,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.120
it can even make the interviewer

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.660
feel a little uncomfortable.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.760
Sorry, I think I forgot to brush my teeth this morning.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.340
The interview should be a positive experience

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.380
for everyone, for you and for them.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.400
So you may not realise it, but in English you can be late

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.720
or you can be nervous without apologizing for it.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.680
So I want to show you

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.740
some alternative expressions to try.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.580
Thank you so much for your patience, I made it.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.120
My English tends to get a little shaky during interviews

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.840
so I might ask you to repeat every now and again,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.020
if that's okay?

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.780
Well, I'm excited about this interview,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.100
what should we talk about?

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.300
To be honest, I don't know the answer right now.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.760
I need a little bit more time to think about it.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.220
Can you see the difference? We're responding to

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.180
exactly the same situation,

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.100
but we're doing it in a much more positive way

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.420
so practise these expressions a few times

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.880
so that you've got them ready for action

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.600
just in case you need them during your interview.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.400
And,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.500
if you're really, really feeling like you need to apologise

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.420
for something then don't say "Sorry"

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.540
use "My apologies" instead.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.640
It's just a little more formal

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.120
and a little more appropriate for an interview.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.820
Now the second worst thing that you can do

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.420
during an interview is to make yourself

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.000
the most important thing in the room, especially

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.560
when the interviewer is trying to understand

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.560
why you want the job.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.040
So tell me Emma,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.020
What motivated you to apply for this position?

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.460
Well, my grandma's really sick

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.660
and I have to help pay for her hospital bills, so

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.360
I really need the job.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.680
My current boss is a total nightmare.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.360
I just, I can't wait to get out of there.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.920
Well, I want to learn more about marketing because

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.960
I want to launch my own business and I feel like

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.080
I can do that sooner if I, you know, learn from you guys.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.300
You guys have got such great marketing!

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.800
Actually, I've already got a job so it's not that I need it

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.040
but I've got a bit of spare time during my week and

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.380
this job could be a good filler.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.480
Now maybe you do need the cash,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.360
maybe you are really desperate to learn a particular skill.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.660
Maybe this would be the perfect job to fit your schedule.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.320
But please don't tell them that, right?

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.260
Save these kinds of comments for the conversations

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.420
that you have with your friends after the interview.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.880
Try to avoid saying "I want"

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.900
or "I need" during an interview.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.860
It's not about you. Okay?

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.340
The interviewer is a lot more interested in what

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.180
you can do for them

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.140
rather than how the job is going to benefit you.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.340
So when you're talking about why you want the job,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.320
make sure you talk about how your goals

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.360
and your ambitions can be valuable to them

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.880
and what they want.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.160
So let's look at a few different alternatives.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.760
I just love the story and the concept behind this brand.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.060
I'd love to contribute to the growth of such

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.780
an exciting company.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.600
Well, I learned a lot from my last employer

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.600
and I really think that I can apply those skills to this role

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.540
and get a great outcome for you guys.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.500
Actually this place seems like somewhere where my

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.160
skills would be a great fit

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.200
and I'm excited to take on some new challenges too.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.320
This position seems really interesting, I'd literally

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.040
rearrange my schedule for the chance to be involved.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.820
Can you see the difference?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.760
When you express these types of attitudes,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.240
most interviewers would feel excited

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.880
and optimistic about the contribution

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.500
that you can make to their team.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.000
And finally, the third worst

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.420
thing that you can say or do during an interview.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.620
Alright, well before we wrap things up,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.980
do you have any questions that you'd like to ask me?

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.620
No.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.240
No questions.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.620
No,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.040
I think I've got a pretty good understanding.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.700
Questions.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.980
Questions.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.060
No, not really. No.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.520
So what exactly do you guys do around here?

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.080
Never ever go into an interview without at least

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.740
one or two great questions prepared

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.720
so that you can ask them to the interviewer yourself.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.700
This is your chance to become the interviewer

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.340
for a few minutes and even if you don't have any

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.240
specific questions, that shouldn't stop you from at least

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.460
showing interest in asking questions.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.640
This is how we show interest in other people

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.600
and in the context of an interview that is exactly

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.400
what you need to be doing. You want to show interest.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.460
You want to be curious about the job.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.860
So are you married? You've got kids?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.820
That's too curious!

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.260
But curious and interested enough

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.900
to generate some good discussion about

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.020
the interviewer, about the company that they work for

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.640
or about the position.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.160
So the best way to do this is with open-ended questions.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.940
An open-ended question is one that

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.000
the person answering can't answer in just a few words.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.320
Okay, they need to explain or express something,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.820
give an opinion a perspective or a reason.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.600
Closed questions are answered with yes or no.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.660
Do you like working here?

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.360
This is a closed question. Right? It's limited. But

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.100
"What motivates you to keep working here?"

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.280
is an open-ended question.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.040
Alright, can you see the difference?

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.660
The answer is going to be much different.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.140
So I want you to practice these ones with me.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.720
Sure, I've got a few questions.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.460
What's the work culture like here?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.720
Actually, yes,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.440
how would you describe the management style here?

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.560
Yes, I was wondering

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.080
what the company's five-year plan is

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.080
and how does this role fit into it?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800
Yeah, I've got one more question.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.920
What kinds of opportunities are there to learn

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.720
and grow in my role? What's the company's

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.920
position on professional development?

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.560
So questions like these, open-ended questions,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.060
allow you to direct the conversation to the interviewer

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.140
and give yourself a bit of a break

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.140
from being under the spotlight.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.140
So that was three things that you should

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.920
definitely avoid during interviews.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.340
So while you're preparing for an English job interview,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.120
I want you to make sure that you consciously

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.780
try to avoid those different scenarios.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.400
Now have you got any advice about what to say

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.140
or perhaps what not to say during an interview?

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.900
I'd love to hear about it so make sure you

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.720
share it in the comments below and if you enjoyed this

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.080
lesson, make sure you let me know by giving it a like

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.160
and leaving a comment down below.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.800
I'm thinking about making some more videos

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.060
to help you perform better at interviews

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.300
so if you like the sound of that then let me know.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.340
But in the meantime you can jump right into another

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.140
professional English lesson right there.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400
I'll see you in there!
