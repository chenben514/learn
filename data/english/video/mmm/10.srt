00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.740
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.720
I've been getting lots of requests for lessons

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.060
that will help you to expand your vocabulary

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.600
and help you to sound more professional

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.420
when speaking in English.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.900
So that is exactly what this lesson is all about today.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.359
I'm going to take some very common

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.480
everyday English verbs and improve them a little

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.260
or give you some more impressive ones to use instead.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.400
So if you're ready to do that, stick around.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.300
I want to jump in with a quick message from our friends

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.960
at Lingoda to talk about their business English course

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.900
and the fact that they're offering mmmEnglish students

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.940
the chance to try their classes for free

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.280
which I'll tell you about soon.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.880
Anyone who studied business English will tell you

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.520
that it's quite different to general conversational English.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.720
The language that we use at work tends to be more

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.220
formal so for anyone studying English to advance

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.260
their career, being able to communicate professionally

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.720
is going to help you to do that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.840
Luckily at Lingoda, not only can you study French,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.360
Spanish, German and of course, English classes,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.119
they also have a specific business English course

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.660
and what I love about this is that you're studying

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.040
alongside other professionals

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.200
focusing on the English skills that you need

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.640
to communicate effectively in your workplace

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.500
like presentation skills and interview skills.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.120
The skills that you need to help you progress

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.700
your career and to succeed in an international company.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.920
Like all Lingoda courses, classes are available

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.040
twenty-four seven and in small groups.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.380
When I was taking Spanish classes with Lingoda,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.799
we usually had three or four students in each class

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.920
which was awesome! I had lots of speaking practice.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.700
Business English classes with Lingoda will increase

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.300
your fluency and your confidence to use

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.680
English at work.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.760
You can sign up for free for seven days

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.900
and try up to three group classes which is an

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.420
awesome way to see what the classes are like

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.440
before you decide to continue.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.900
Or you can use this code down here and get

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.720
a fifteen per cent discount on your first month.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.120
Use the link down in the description and definitely

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.220
go check them out.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.780
Let's think for a moment about the many

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.160
basic functions that we do when we're at work.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.420
We think about things. We make things.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.980
We change things. We guess.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.120
We solve problems and we work together.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.400
Now all of these words are good

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.260
and they will definitely help you to communicate

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.360
your message

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.160
but they're quite basic so if you want to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.200
sound impressive, impress your boss

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.980
sound more professional with colleagues and clients

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.700
then upgrading these words will definitely help.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.540
So let's start with the verb 'think'

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.580
specifically to think of or to think about something.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.560
To think about attending an event

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.860
or asking for a raise.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.820
Now we can upgrade this phrasal verb to 'consider'.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.320
So instead of saying

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.260
I will think about your suggestion.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.080
Say: I will consider your suggestion

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.360
but I need to find some extra budget before I approve it.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.960
We can also upgrade

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.700
Have you thought about employing?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.200
Have you considered employing a marketing

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.880
assistant in-house?

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.460
Now if you're thinking about something and the decision

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.480
is difficult for some reason, it's also important

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.220
then using 'deliberate' is a much better choice.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.720
Deliberate.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.500
So it's also a synonym of think about but it's used when

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.600
you're making a really tough decision

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.620
and you've got to take some extra time

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.240
to decide carefully.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.600
You've been deliberating all week on this,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.860
are you any closer to a decision?

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.880
We also have this idea of thinking something is...

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.520
I think Ben is one of the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.980
best mentors in our organisation.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.340
But we can improve this by using the verb 'believe'.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.800
I believe

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.120
Ben is one of the best mentors in our organisation.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.900
So it sounds much surer, more confident and more

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.540
assertive.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.240
We can also use 'consider' here as well

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.380
but the structure changes a little.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.400
So I want you to pay close attention

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.540
to what changes in this sentence.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.440
We can say: I think or I believe Ben is

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.040
but we can also say

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.520
I consider Ben to be one of the best mentors

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.160
in our organisation.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.020
So when you use this language, it helps you to speak

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.200
with authority, to be more impressive, more confident.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.660
It really sounds like you know what you're talking about.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.160
Another really common verb to use at work is 'to make'

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.540
That's what we're there doing isn't it? We're making stuff

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.300
and there are lots of different words that we can use

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.780
instead of 'make'

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.500
but it really does depend on the context as to which one

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.800
you can use or you should use.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.360
Let's take a look at this sentence and see

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360
how we can improve it.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.620
Our team made a report or wrote a report.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.840
Can you think of a more professional verb

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840
that you could use instead?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.540
Should we prepare a report for the board?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.000
Our team has already produced a detailed report.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.340
So these words 'prepare' and 'produce'

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.340
are almost synonyms.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.860
Prepare.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.300
Prepare relates to the process, a little more.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.960
And produce,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.580
relates a little more to the result.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.160
So we often see the collocation produce content,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.340
prepare a report.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.820
These are useful ones to keep in mind.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.440
'To create' is another verb upgrade on make right

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.440
especially when you're talking about

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.440
design or creative activities,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.720
really when you're making something new you know.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.320
We're creating a new concept for the client.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.240
Can you create a new image that we can

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.800
share on social media?

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.500
We created a design that will suit a range of users.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.760
'Develop' is another synonym for make,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.480
kind of leans a little more towards the process.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.200
Our technical team is developing a plan to transition

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.220
to our new platform by May.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.120
Or even better, a strategy.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.460
A strategy. They're developing a strategy.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.880
We also develop ideas and we develop solutions.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.100
We're developing an affordable solution that will make

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.500
sure every family can access high-speed internet.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.360
So these are really important collocations

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.120
to keep in mind when you're using these verbs.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.620
Often the idea of change can be perceived as negative,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.240
people don't usually like change, do they?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.240
Often we talk about change at work

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.540
because we need to fix something.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.940
It suggests that there is something wrong

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.780
so in a professional context,

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.140
it's definitely important to make sure that you're polite

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.200
and that you're using language in a supportive way.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.320
And I've got some alternative words and some useful

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.360
expressions that will help you with that.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.760
And 'modify' is a really good alternative.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.640
Modify.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.960
Modify suggests minor changes,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.180
tweaks and adjustments

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.780
and things that will improve the result.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.400
Actually, you could also use the verb 'adjust'.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.100
If it's okay with you, I'll adjust

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.320
this a little before we send it to the client.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.479
Now when you're talking about changing ideas or

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:44.480
human behaviour, then 'adapt' is a really good choice

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.600
especially when there is a new situation or

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.600
a new set of circumstances that's behind that change.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.519
Again, nobody really likes change do they but if you can

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.720
use a more positive verb to help talk about that change

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.220
then it's much easier to get other people on board right?

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.560
The new regulations are tough,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.640
there's not much that we can do about it!

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.960
We just need to adapt and keep moving forward.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.380
The word 'transition' is an excellent one to begin using

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.360
and to understand because it helps us to talk about

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.140
the need for change and the process of changing

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.940
in a comfortable way.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.260
So if we transition from one thing to another,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.320
it suggests that we sort of move carefully you know,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.620
it's not instant change which usually scares people.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.340
If we talk about transition, it suggests that the change

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.780
is going to be gradual and carefully considered.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.140
We want to make sure that our new team members

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.500
transition into their new roles

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.400
as seamlessly as possible.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.680
Although many of us try not to admit it,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.480
we all guess what the heck is going on right,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.900
it's part of solving problems and reducing risk

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.120
is taking a guess.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.760
And there are so many great words that will help you

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.640
to sound more intelligent and more professional

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.860
when you have to take a guess.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.320
We all do right?

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.480
But sometimes using 'guess' suggests that you're a little

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.100
uncertain, you know, and in a professional context,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.760
it can make you seem

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.180
uninformed or unprepared.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.160
So using 'estimate' suggests that

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.800
you've put some thought into this prediction

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.060
or this guess right?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.600
Estimate.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.780
It's difficult to estimate the financial impact for families.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.440
Now 'calculate' is a really good option

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.880
when you're talking about specific numbers.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.840
You calculate.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.020
We calculate that this will save

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.880
three thousand dollars a month.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.960
Now we have a slightly different word form here

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.120
but you can express the same idea by saying:

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.880
By our calculations, we will save

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.720
three thousand dollars a month.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.140
When you're thinking about why something happened

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.380
or you're considering what might happen in the future,

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.040
then 'speculate' is a great word.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.740
To speculate.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.760
So usually we say 'speculate on' or

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.920
'speculate about' something.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.100
I don't want to speculate on why he

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.740
resigned so suddenly.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
And 'predict' is another great synonym for guess.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.040
Predict.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.940
So it's used when

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.180
you're taking information that you have

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.839
and you're making a call or a decision

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.040
about the most likely outcome.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.000
Industry experts are predicting significant

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.940
changes to our working environments post-pandemic.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.280
It is difficult to talk positively about problems right

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.420
when things aren't going so well or maybe they've been

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.520
a little more difficult than you anticipated.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.160
So what words can you use instead of 'problem'

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.800
which does kind of have a negative about it, doesn't it?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.340
Well we can say challenge,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.080
we can say complication,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.720
obstacle.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.660
These are all possible replacements, right?

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.100
In a professional context, we want to make sure that we

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.460
communicate any problems that we have clearly

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.840
but also do it in a way that makes it sound like

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.860
you have solutions or you have a plan

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.200
to keep things under control.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.460
We overcame several obstacles

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.060
before we landed on the result.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.540
We anticipate some technical challenges but we're

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.300
confident that we've got the right team

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.180
in place to deal with them.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.399
We even talk about problems as

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.680
headaches or hiccups.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.460
These are a little less formal ways of expressing it

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.240
but they definitely help to emphasise that the problem is

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.700
not so serious you know or that they're problems that

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.940
can be managed, they're just annoying.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.680
I can see how these changes could create

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.840
some headaches for the sales team

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.840
but we're working on a solution.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.380
There were a few hiccups with the new ordering system

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.140
on Friday,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.840
but things have been much smoother this week.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.020
And lastly, if you work in an office as part of a team,

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.000
it's very likely that you work together

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.600
with other people to get things done, right?

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.560
We work together. We work as a team.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:50.080
But just to clarify, we do not do a teamwork

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.700
all right? This is a very common mistake

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.640
that a lot of my students make.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.980
'Teamwork' is a noun and we never use it with

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.240
'do' okay? We don't do a teamwork.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.420
And a much more professional way to explain that

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.260
you're working together with someone else

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.700
or with other people

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.260
is to say that you collaborate.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.540
I'm looking forward to collaborating

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.640
on projects with you in the future.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.600
Now if you really want to emphasise that two people

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.760
or maybe two teams with different skill sets

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.620
or sets of expertise are coming together

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.660
to work together, we say that they're joining forces.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.820
They join forces. And this is quite powerful.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.660
When our development team joined forces with our

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.460
product team, they created something amazing.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.620
So there you have it, I really hope that you found

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.120
a few new expressions to expand your vocabulary

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.079
range a little. Make sure that you keep these words

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.300
beside you at work during this week

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.440
and see if you can apply them.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.380
You know if you're writing an email, make sure you stop

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.100
before you hit send, to try and

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.460
upgrade some of the language that you're using

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.040
to sound more professional and more helpful.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.980
Now you know I like to set a little challenge

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.460
at the end of my lessons and that's because

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.340
just watching my lessons isn't really enough, is it?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.600
You've got to put into practice what you've been learning

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.120
and it's only going to take you a few minutes.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.620
So hit the pause button right now and write

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.760
a short paragraph using at least five of the

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.980
professional words that I shared during this lesson.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.720
I'm really excited to get down there and check them out

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.080
to give you some feedback,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.960
make sure you're using them correctly.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.580
But in the meantime,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.220
I've got this lesson right here ready for you

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.040
to continue practising with me

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.080
so I'll see you in there!
