00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.760
Hello! I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.320
Over the past few weeks, I've been talking about idioms

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.420
and expressions that are commonly used in

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.960
business and professional contexts.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.900
And I wanted to give you the opportunity to practise

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.760
using them in context

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.440
with the correct tone, pronunciation, intonation

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.840
and facial expression.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.620
So this is an imitation lesson.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680
Now you might have already practised

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.180
with some of my other imitation lessons.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.120
There are several on my channel,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.540
which you can watch right here.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.820
Now these imitation lessons allow you

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.800
to practise your speaking skills with me,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.900
out loud.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.900
If this is your first time practising

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.040
with one of my imitation lessons,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.120
don't worry.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.140
I'll explain exactly what you need to do

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.340
and later in the lesson, I'll share one way that you can

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880
keep practising what you learn in this lesson

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.660
with a native English speaker.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
So keep watching!

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.260
So there are three very simple steps

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
in my imitation lessons.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
Firstly, you just need to listen to me

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.900
and read the text on screen.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.080
Then you'll hear me say the same thing again

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.520
but after each clause or sentence

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.660
there'll be a pause in the video

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.280
where you can imitate me out loud.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.700
So that just means you'll copy and repeat

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.600
exactly what I said out loud.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.940
Lastly, I'll invite you to shadow me

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.440
which means speaking the words with me

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.440
at the same time.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.800
That way, you can copy the natural rhythm in my voice.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.860
Ready to get started?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
Remember at first, you just need to listen

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.720
and read the words on the screen.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.320
Well, actually I'm not even supposed to be

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.800
attending this conference,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.720
but my boss offered me his ticket

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.660
and I didn't want to turn it down!

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.920
I really need to brush up on my

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.920
project management skills actually.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.840
I've taken on a new role in the sales team

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.380
and I've been flat out ever since!

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.240
I've even started giving weekly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.180
presentations to the board,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.480
but my workload is just getting a bit out of hand.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.880
I did yesterday's presentation completely off-the-cuff!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.820
But, go back six months

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.240
and it was a very different story..

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.240
I was seriously considering jumping ship!

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.160
Really! Almost half the team had lost their jobs!

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.780
Luckily, we've since got a new general manager

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.740
on board

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.860
and I think I told you about her, didn't I?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.040
She's been doing an amazing job so far;

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.040
runs a very tight ship

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.160
but I guess that's how she turned things around!

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.220
Anyway, it hasn't all been smooth sailing

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.060
but things are finally getting back on track!

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.060
How are things with you?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.140
Did you notice that the words

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.260
looked a little different on screen?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.760
The bold words are stressed words

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.740
and the underlined vowels are

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.400
stressed syllables in each word.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.500
These words and syllables sound stronger and clearer

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.320
while the others reduce and become weaker.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.900
Paying close attention to them will help you to sound

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.800
more natural when you speak.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.980
You can learn more about stress syllables

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.760
here in this lesson.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.040
But right now, you're ready to imitate me.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.500
Remember there will be a pause after

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.480
each clause or sentence

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.220
and that's when you need to imitate what I said

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.420
exactly as I said it, exactly how I said it.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.820
So try to copy the intonation and the tone in my voice

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.260
even the expression on my face

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.780
or the gestures I make with my hands.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.520
Well, actually,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.780
I'm not even supposed to be attending this conference,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.040
but my boss offered me his ticket

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.160
and I didn't want to turn it down!

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.320
I really need to brush up

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.440
on my project management skills actually.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.180
I've taken on a new role in the sales team

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.500
and I've been flat out ever since!

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.820
I've even started giving weekly presentations

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.400
to the board,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.680
but my workload is just getting a bit out of hand.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.740
I did yesterday's presentation completely off-the-cuff!

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.860
But go back six months and it was a very different story

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.660
I was seriously considering jumping ship!

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.380
Really! Almost half the team had lost their jobs!

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.700
Luckily,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.640
we've since got a new general manager on board

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.240
and I think I told you about her, didn't I?

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.200
She's been doing an amazing job so far;

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.660
runs a very tight ship

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.420
but I guess that's how she turned things
around!

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.020
Anyway, it hasn't all been smooth sailing

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.440
but things are finally getting back on track!

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.320
How are things with you?

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.740
Nice work!

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.160
At this point,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.640
you might want to practise a few more times

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.340
and that's fine!

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.520
You just need to go back in the video and practise again,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.280
practise as many times as you need to.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.980
In fact, you could even practise this script

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.860
with a native English speaker,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.280
to check your pronunciation and expression

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.260
and to get feedback on how you can improve.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.780
You could do this with one of the English teachers

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.620
at Cambly.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.080
I've put the link in the description for you because

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.120
your first fifteen minute lesson is free!

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.120
May as well try it out!

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.720
So are you ready to keep practising with step three now?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.440
This time, you need to shadow me

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.180
and it's a little more difficult to do because

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.160
we'll be speaking at the same time

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.240
but it allows you to practise making the sounds

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.720
and following the natural rhythm of my voice

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.500
to help you sound much more natural

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.240
while using English.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.400
Don't worry if you make some mistakes,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.900
just try to relax and go with the flow!

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.180
You can practise as many times as you need to.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.100
Well, actually,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.980
I'm not even supposed to be attending this conference

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.060
but my boss offered me his ticket

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.120
and I didn't want to turn it down!

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.140
I really need to brush up

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.300
on my project management skills actually.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.260
I've taken on a new role in the sales team

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.780
and I've been flat out ever since!

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.420
I've even started giving weekly

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.420
presentations to the board,

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.720
but my workload is just getting a bit out of hand.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.400
I did yesterday's presentation completely off-the-cuff!

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.780
But go back six months and it was a very different story

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.200
I was seriously considering jumping ship!

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.500
Really! Almost half the team had lost their jobs!

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.340
Luckily,

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.060
we've since got a new general manager on board

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.960
and I think I told you about her, didn't I?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.380
She's been doing an amazing job so far;

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.460
runs a very tight ship

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.300
but I guess that's how she turned things around!

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.640
Anyway, it hasn't all been smooth sailing

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.220
but things are finally getting back on track!

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.100
How are things with you?

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.860
That's great!

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.020
I'm sure you got a little tongue-tied there

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.960
but don't worry about it,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.000
keep practising with this video until you start

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.520
getting the hang of it.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.500
Remember that you can claim your free lesson

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.420
with one of the native English speakers on Cambly

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.960
and get some personal feedback

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.960
on your English pronunciation.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.000
Don't forget to subscribe to the mmmEnglish Channel

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.360
and keep practising right now if you want to

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.320
with these lessons right here.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.200
I'll see you next week for another English lesson

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.700
here at mmmEnglish.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.240
Bye for now!
