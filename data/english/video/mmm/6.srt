00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.280
Hello! I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.100
English in the workplace.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.800
At work, in the office.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.260
Knowing the idioms, phrasal verbs

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.620
and unique vocabulary that's

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.940
used in these professional contexts is so important!

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.840
I'll admit that there is a lot to learn there.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.280
But today I want to focus on some really common,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.500
very useful expressions that you'll hear often at work

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.780
and in these professional contexts .

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.680
At the office. With your colleagues.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280
With your boss. With your clients, your customers.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
In interviews, speaking exams, with your teacher

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.120
or your university professor.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.040
If you haven't already noticed, you'll soon realise

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.540
that the office is where idioms and English expressions

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.780
go wild.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.400
At times it feels like people only speak

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
using idioms and slang.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.740
So whether you're flat out, getting off-track,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.640
losing your train of thought or banking on an early finish,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.620
these 10 essential business English expressions

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.420
will help you to sound more natural and confident

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.480
at work.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.600
Learning these expressions is essential

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.480
and a fantastic way to hear them being used in context

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.220
is by listening to audiobooks.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.920
I use Audible to listen to books all the time

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.760
and I've teamed up with them to offer you a free trial,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.440
a free audiobook for 30 days,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.920
so that you can try it out yourself!

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.280
I've been using Audible for years now

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.740
but while I don't often have time to sit and read a book,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.780
I can listen while I'm driving

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.760
or while I'm going for a run or I'm waiting for the train.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.600
So they offer a really fantastic solution

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.160
to keep practising your English and for this lesson,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.120
I've listed some fantastic books relating to business

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.200
in the description box below.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.400
So you can check out my recommendations for Audible

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400
right there.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.260
So let's start with "flat out".

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.560
If you're "flat out", you're incredibly busy,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.660
you have lots to do,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.660
so much that you can't stop to have a break.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.340
I'll be flat out next week

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.520
because there's a new shipment arriving.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.060
I've been flat out all week, I'm exhausted!

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.580
In Australia where I'm from, we might also use

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.180
"flat chat".

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.660
It's used in exactly the same way

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.300
to mean that someone is very busy.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.380
Train of thought.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.780
Have you ever been talking about something and then

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.800
completely forgotten what you're talking about

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.220
and why you're talking about it.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.440
It happens to me more often than I'd like to admit

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.180
but this happens when your train of thought

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.360
gets distracted by something else.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.900
The clear progression of your thoughts are stopped

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.260
by something.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.960
So the expression that you'll most commonly hear is

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.560
"Oh! I've lost my train of thought!

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.840
What was I talking about?"

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.520
I've lost my train of thought.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.260
My mum called and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.740
completely disrupted my train of thought.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.680
Can I ask you a question?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.820
Just give me a minute,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.080
I don't want to disrupt my train of thought.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.900
Now if you lose your train of thought you'll need to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.180
get back on track.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.840
If something is on track, it's happening as it should be

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.780
there's no problem at all.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.120
If something is not happening as you planned and

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.680
you want to change it, you want to get back on track.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.600
We missed the deadline last week,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.760
but we've just submitted the report now,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.700
so we're getting back on track.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.680
Are you on track to complete the report

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.020
by the end of the week?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.700
So logically, if something is not on track it's not

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.780
happening as it should be, then you're off track.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.580
Imagine this, you're busy, you're flat out,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.560
and you have to attend a meeting about a project

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.840
that you're working on.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.160
But the people at the meeting are not prepared

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.760
and the conversation is just going everywhere!

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.360
People are talking about their kids, what they had for

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.520
dinner last night, any other issue

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.960
except what you should be talking about.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.860
So you decide to interrupt the conversation and say:

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400
We're getting off track here guys.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.280
We've only got ten more minutes left

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.680
and we need to confirm the marketing budget.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.100
It's used to say that a person or a group of people

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.720
have become distracted from their main purpose.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.960
They've lost their focus.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.700
That's just like my aunt Mary actually,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.700
she does it all the time!

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.280
She lives on her own which is probably why

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.560
but her house is beautiful and she's got

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.200
the dogs to keep her company.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.580
Sorry, I'm getting off track!

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.120
Here are a few more examples.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.620
It's difficult to stay on track with so many disruptions,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.260
perhaps we should move to the conference room.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.120
I don't want to get off track, but we can all agree that the

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.380
new marketing manager is difficult to get along with.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.620
We should have completed the work by now,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.780
but the team got off track with some technical issues.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.920
This idiom also has a literal meaning.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.880
To get lost or lose your direction.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.060
To  literally get off the track and here,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.180
a track means a path or a road.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.900
So if you're off the track, you're not on the road,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.880
on the path that you need to be on.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.960
To bank on.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.920
To bank on something means to bet

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.700
that something will happen in a certain way.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.300
To be really sure

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.880
or confident that something will happen

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.780
So for example.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.940
I'm banking on Sarah to get a promotion,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.700
so that I can apply for her position.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.800
Since it's a public holiday on Monday,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.540
we're banking on an early finish tonight.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.840
It can also be used in a negative sentence,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.460
often advising someone against something.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.180
I wouldn't bank on it.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.660
That means it's not a good idea

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.660
to assume that it will happen.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.900
To brush up on.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.800
This is a phrasal verb, but one that's idiomatic

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.440
and it means to update or to improve your skills

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.880
in some way.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.920
It can be used in any context really, formal or informal,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.960
but this expression is

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.040
so useful in a professional context

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.800
because sometimes it can be a little awkward or

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.360
embarrassing to say that you don't have fantastic skills

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.300
in one area.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.120
Right?

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.960
But by saying that you need to brush up on those skills

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.260
is a much softer way of saying that you're

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.279
not that good at something but you are willing to

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.040
practise or study to improve those skills.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.200
I'm brushing up on my Italian

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.480
because I've got a business trip in July.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.880
I got the job at the publishing company!

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.420
But I really need to brush up on my editing skills.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.280
I'm out of practice!

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.800
To bring something to the table.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.040
So this idiom means to provide something

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.720
that will be of benefit. Something useful.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.520
And it's often used in a professional context

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.600
to describe the skills or experience that someone

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.660
brings to a team or to a company.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.720
The great thing about Sam is that she brings

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.240
years of management experience to the table.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.520
See how the "something" in our structure is

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.020
a noun phrase here.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.020
This is really common with this expression.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.420
He brings excellent communication skills and

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.120
award-winning design experience to the table.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.880
But during a meeting you might also hear

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.960
someone use this expression.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960
What have you brought to the table?

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.360
And that means what suggestions or ideas did you

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.960
bring to the meeting, can you offer to the people

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.080
in the meeting.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.640
To bring up.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.900
Now this is a very common phrasal verb.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.960
You've probably heard it before.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.320
It means to mention or introduce a topic.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.480
Someone can bring something up during a meeting,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.700
a call or a casual conversation.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.240
I'll bring it up with Stephanie when I see her next week.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.560
Our presentation is missing some of the key points.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.020
So I'm going to bring it up with the team tomorrow,

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.920
we can spend some more time on it.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.080
To turn down.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.580
Again, this is another common phrasal verb

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.800
but it's also idiomatic.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.800
It means to say no to something or refuse something.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.980
They offered me tickets to the conference,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.840
but I had to turn them down

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.980
because it's my son's birthday.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.980
He turned it down

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.500
because they offered him the promotion,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.940
but told him that they couldn't increase his salary.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.220
I applied for the position but then I found out

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.280
I had to spend six months of the year

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.700
living in New Zealand. So I had to turn them down.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.000
Now when you do something without planning

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.540
or preparing for it,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.340
there are a couple of useful expressions

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.680
that you can use.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.160
You can say that you'll "wing it".

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.260
My presentation's on my laptop,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.540
which I left at home, I'll just have to wing it.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.440
If you haven't received the notes,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.420
you'll just have to wing it.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.900
Usually this idiom suggests that you didn't really plan it

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.640
to be that way but for some reason,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.700
you're under-prepared.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.200
If you do something that's off-the-cuff,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.800
you're doing something without preparing for it

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.580
but you're kind of comfortable with that

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.040
you're cool with that.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.040
I wish that I was confident enough to make

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.880
presentations off-the-cuff,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.600
I spend so much time

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.780
planning for our monthly board meetings.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.180
Paul won an award last night

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.440
and made a fantastic speech totally

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.300
totally off-the-cuff!

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.280
Well that's it for this lesson,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.920
I hope you learnt some new expressions.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.520
Remember that these expressions are often used in a

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.480
professional context

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.520
but not only in a professional context.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.980
You'll often hear them used in casual, informal contexts

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.740
as well, so they're good ones to learn and practise.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.740
