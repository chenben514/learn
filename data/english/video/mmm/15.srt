00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.377
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:07.257
If there&nbsp;is a place where English idioms are used

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:08.963
most frequently

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.557
it's at work.

00:00:10.557 --> 00:00:14.959
Learning&nbsp;and using these idioms in the workplace

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.980
with your colleagues, with your clients and your&nbsp;managers

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.431
is an essential communication skill.

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:24.615
You need to understand the people that you work&nbsp;with

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.412
and you want to develop a broader range of expressing

00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:30.566
your ideas in English, don't you?

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.666
You want to sound intelligent and professional

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.589
and sometimes you want to sound funny.

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.734
Learning&nbsp;the business English idioms in today's lesson

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.237
is definitely going to help&nbsp;you to do that.

00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:43.016
Are you ready?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.734
Let's start at the very moment that you get your&nbsp;job or even

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:56.219
just before it because there are a couple of really fantastic

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.551
idioms that you can&nbsp;use to talk about this moment.

00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:02.413
The first is to get your foot in the door.

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:06.888
And this means to enter an&nbsp;organisation or an industry

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:08.030
for the first time.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.106
We use it to talk about starting out at a lower level

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:16.163
or maybe a less desirable position within the organisation

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:19.583
but there's a chance or an intention

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:22.675
of moving up and becoming more senior or becoming

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:24.000
more successful.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.332
So it talks about an opportunity&nbsp;to get started at a company,

00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:32.382
a company that you want to advance or progress within.

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:36.356
An internship&nbsp;is a great way to get your foot in the door,

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:38.060
to get your foot in the door

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.396
of a company that you really&nbsp;want to work for.

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:43.040
Volunteering in your industry

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.930
will probably help you to get your foot in the&nbsp;door,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.554
you'll get to meet some people who work in your field,

00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:52.085
you'll get some relevant experience.

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:54.615
So&nbsp;all of this is super helpful.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:57.781
Now once you've got your foot in the door and you're starting

00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:01.220
your&nbsp;new job, there's always a period of time,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.079
maybe a week, two weeks, a month

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.143
where you've got to&nbsp;get used to things.

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:10.777
You need to learn all the administrative processes.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:12.895
You've got to meet the&nbsp;team,

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:14.557
you've got to take over some new

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:16.754
projects and things that you're working on.

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:20.696
Hopefully,&nbsp;there'll be someone there to show you the ropes.

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:23.487
To show someone the ropes means

00:02:23.487 --> 00:02:26.957
to show them how&nbsp;to do a job or an activity.

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:29.874
I've never worked in customer service before 

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:31.740
but Kate showed me the&nbsp;ropes.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.353
Unfortunately not everyone is so lucky when they start their job.

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:39.514
Sometimes you just get&nbsp;thrown in the deep end

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:43.193
which means you get put into a situation without a lot of

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:46.169
preparation&nbsp;or much introduction.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.766
You've kind of got to just work it out for yourself.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.273
I was thrown in the deep&nbsp;end with my first teaching job.

00:02:53.447 --> 00:02:57.692
I had a class of fifty children with no experience or mentor

00:02:57.692 --> 00:03:00.585
to guide&nbsp;me. I'd never taught kids before.

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:04.112
It was stressful. I had to learn really quickly.

00:03:04.112 --> 00:03:06.027
Have you ever been&nbsp;thrown in the deep end

00:03:06.027 --> 00:03:07.772
when you started a new job?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.666
It's nasty.

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:13.178
Let me know about it down in the&nbsp;comments.

00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:15.569
See if you can use that idiom yourself.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.272
So yeah,

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:21.701
that first teaching job was a steep&nbsp;learning curve for me.

00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:23.926
Have you heard about this noun before?

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.849
A learning curve.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.432
It's often used with&nbsp;the adjective steep, a steep learning curve.

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:34.255
So we use learning curve to talk about new skills

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:38.053
that&nbsp;we're acquiring at a job and that learning curve describes

00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:41.659
the rate at which someone progresses and&nbsp;they're learning

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:42.731
this new skill.

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.225
A steep learning curve is when you have to learn something

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.586
very&nbsp;quickly in a short space of time

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:51.732
and this can be really challenging

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.483
like walking up a steep&nbsp;hill

00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:57.241
compared to walking up a nice gradual hill.

00:03:57.241 --> 00:04:00.924
If you're starting a job with no prior experience,

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:03.500
it can be a really steep learning curve.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.915
Or if you don't have anyone showing you the ropes,

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:09.549
the first&nbsp;few weeks are going to be difficult,

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.667
it's going to be quite stressful. It can be a steep learning&nbsp;curve.

00:04:14.252 --> 00:04:17.440
Finding someone genuine and reliable to

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.798
practise speaking English with regularly is really&nbsp;hard.

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:24.153
If you don't want to pay someone by the hour

00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:27.743
and you don't have time to wade through random&nbsp;strangers

00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:30.590
on the internet, then come and check out Hey Lady!

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.767
Hey Lady! is an online community created&nbsp;just for women.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:38.943
It's a safe and supportive space where you can meet friendly

00:04:38.943 --> 00:04:42.997
speaking partners easily and practise having real conversations

00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:45.587
about interesting topics in English.

00:04:45.587 --> 00:04:49.092
As long as&nbsp;your English level is intermediate or above 

00:04:49.092 --> 00:04:52.451
then your English is good enough to join the community.

start your free trial today.

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.216
Let's focus&nbsp;on some idioms now that are useful to describe

00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:09.356
the different ways of working.

00:05:09.486 --> 00:05:12.003
If you do something&nbsp;by the book,

00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:16.261
it means that you do something exactly as it should be done.

00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.949
You follow the rules,&nbsp;the laws or the steps,

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.514
the procedure that you have been told to follow.

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:27.113
So you do everything correctly.&nbsp;It's by the book.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.781
On the other hand, if you cut corners that means

00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:36.417
you complete the task in the&nbsp;easiest, the quickest

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:40.633
and maybe the cheapest way possible. It means that

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.878
maybe you haven't done the&nbsp;job as

00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:46.016
thoroughly as you should have done it and therefore

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:51.079
the end result is maybe not as good as it could have been.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:54.543
Now look, the company will be audited next month

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:57.039
so I don't want anyone cutting&nbsp;corners.

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.270
We need everything done by the book!

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.762
Sometimes the work that you have&nbsp;to do is

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.798
difficult or it's complex.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.255
And sometimes you have a lot of work to do

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:09.747
and not a&nbsp;lot of time to do it in, right?

00:06:09.747 --> 00:06:13.781
The idiom to have your work cut out for you describes

00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:15.861
exactly this&nbsp;situation.

00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:17.450
Geez,

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.719
you'll have your work cut out for you finishing those

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.156
reports by Friday.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:24.769
It's going&nbsp;to be hard work to get everything done by Friday.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:27.798
There's a lot to do and not a lot of time

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.785
but then&nbsp;sometimes you think that a job is going to be hard

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:33.905
or it's going to take a lot of time but

00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:36.350
you're&nbsp;surprised when you get something done

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.504
quickly and easily.

00:06:37.634 --> 00:06:40.280
So in this situation, we use

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.925
make light work&nbsp;or short work of something.

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:46.724
He made light work of writing the reports.

00:06:46.724 --> 00:06:50.225
He wrote them quickly and it&nbsp;was easy to do.

00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:52.335
Now you can actually use this idiom

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:54.575
outside of a work context too.

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:57.245
Let's say I made a delicious cake

00:06:57.245 --> 00:07:01.473
and when I came back an hour later it was all gone.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.479
You certainly&nbsp;made short work of that cake.

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.566
It's gone, it was eaten very quickly. It was finished very quickly.

00:07:11.477 --> 00:07:16.105
Communication is an essential part of our work lives, right?

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:18.119
Without effective communication,

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:21.958
most&nbsp;of our plans or our projects and our relationships,

00:07:22.132 --> 00:07:24.142
they would completely fail.

00:07:24.142 --> 00:07:27.724
So whether you work for&nbsp;yourself and most of the time you're

00:07:27.724 --> 00:07:31.530
communicating with your own clients or maybe you work as

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.771
part&nbsp;of a team and you communicate with your colleagues

00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:38.045
then there are definitely some awesome idioms to&nbsp;help you

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:40.321
communicate in English.

00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:44.687
We use the idiom to touch base with somebody

00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:48.522
in a similar way&nbsp;as we use the phrasal verb check in.

00:07:48.522 --> 00:07:51.657
So when you touch base with someone you talk to them

00:07:51.657 --> 00:07:55.089
quickly&nbsp;and you find out how they're doing

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:57.168
or what they think about something

00:07:57.168 --> 00:08:00.637
or about a project that&nbsp;they've been working on.

00:08:00.637 --> 00:08:04.155
Can we touch base next week sometime to discuss the budget?

00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:08.328
Okay but&nbsp;what about when you're rushed, you're in a hurry,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.644
you've got a lot of work to do and you just need&nbsp;to be quite direct

00:08:11.644 --> 00:08:13.713
in this conversation, we need to

00:08:13.713 --> 00:08:16.362
just talk about the things that are really&nbsp;important.

00:08:16.514 --> 00:08:18.524
You want to cut to the chase.

00:08:18.524 --> 00:08:21.485
This is the perfect idiom for that situation.

00:08:21.485 --> 00:08:24.689
It means you&nbsp;want to talk about the important things

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:28.209
straight away without wasting any time.

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:31.694
I haven't got much&nbsp;time so let's just cut to the chase.

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:33.482
How much is this gonna cost?

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:36.109
Just be a little careful with this&nbsp;one.

00:08:36.109 --> 00:08:38.730
Using this idiom in the wrong way

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.489
can come off a little rude at times.

00:08:41.489 --> 00:08:42.780
You know if you're just

00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:46.496
in a hurry and the other person is talking about something

00:08:46.496 --> 00:08:49.246
totally unrelated or maybe you're not

00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:52.467
particularly interested in it and you're thinking

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.404
please hurry up, come on.

00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:58.796
Then that's not the&nbsp;right time to use this idiom,

00:08:58.796 --> 00:08:59.981
to cut to the chase.

00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:02.851
It's more something that you say when you want to

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:04.991
bypass or skip

00:09:05.338 --> 00:09:08.774
the usual small talk and chit-chat and just

00:09:08.774 --> 00:09:10.577
get to the important stuff.

00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:14.287
We all know&nbsp;why we're here so let's just cut to the chase.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.269
All right, managing the different&nbsp;relationships that you have at

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:21.815
work, maybe with colleagues and clients and different&nbsp;people

00:09:21.815 --> 00:09:25.079
that you encounter at work. This is really important

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:28.185
and it means sometimes you've got&nbsp;to

00:09:28.185 --> 00:09:29.815
hold back

00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:34.463
and not say what you really think, you have to bite your tongue.

00:09:34.463 --> 00:09:37.794
I wanted&nbsp;to tell him that his idea was ridiculous

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.368
but I bit my tongue.

00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:42.282
Sometimes it's just not&nbsp;appropriate

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:45.530
to say what you really think at work, is it?

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.356
And that's exactly the situation where you might need to

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:49.840
bite your tongue.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.818
Zip it. Don't say anything.

00:09:53.818 --> 00:09:55.821
You know bite that tongue.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.437
Now unfortunately and I think we've all probably experienced it,

00:10:00.437 --> 00:10:02.478
problems can come up at work

00:10:02.478 --> 00:10:06.919
so&nbsp;having a few creative ways to talk about things that are

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:09.935
bothering you or frustrating you&nbsp;can really help to

00:10:09.935 --> 00:10:12.672
lighten the mood a little. So this one

00:10:12.672 --> 00:10:14.355
to rock the boat,

00:10:14.355 --> 00:10:18.027
it describes&nbsp;when you do or you say something that

00:10:18.027 --> 00:10:21.274
upsets people or it causes problems.

00:10:21.513 --> 00:10:25.759
Let's say you&nbsp;want to talk to your boss about your new manager

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.239
who actually has been spending a lot of time

00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:32.469
outside of the office lately and then you think

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.124
she's been so stressed&nbsp;lately since Jessica resigned.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.013
I don't want to rock the boat.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:42.411
Maybe I'll just wait&nbsp;till next month to mention this.

00:10:42.411 --> 00:10:45.583
I don't want to change or disrupt or affect

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:49.519
the current situation&nbsp;myself so I'm not gonna do anything.

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:52.314
Sometimes you have to deal with problems that are caused

00:10:52.314 --> 00:10:53.940
by&nbsp;other people.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.676
Maybe they're new and

00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:58.420
they made a mistake or they did something by accident

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.799
or maybe&nbsp;you work with a really lazy, careless colleague

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:04.365
and they just don't really care much about their&nbsp;job.

00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:07.335
But when it's you spending all of your time

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.282
trying to solve these problems that other people&nbsp;have created,

00:11:11.282 --> 00:11:14.290
little annoying things that are stopping you from doing

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.914
your work, well,

00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:19.911
then we can&nbsp;use this idiom to talk about that,

00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:22.361
to put out fires.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.917
Well we launched the product update successfully

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:29.335
but then no one could log into the platform.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.197
I spent the day responding to complaints and&nbsp;putting out fires.

00:11:34.414 --> 00:11:36.492
So I mean I spent the day

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.945
fixing the problems that were created&nbsp;by the platform update.

00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:44.731
It was stressful, people were annoyed, it meant that I didn't&nbsp;get

00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:47.905
any of the work that I was supposed to do done.

00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:50.366
I just spent my day putting out fires.

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:54.367
Have&nbsp;you ever heard anyone say they're in hot water?

00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:56.154
Well this means they're in trouble,

00:11:56.154 --> 00:11:58.279
they could&nbsp;be in trouble with someone.

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.643
They're probably in a difficult situation because of something

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:06.145
that they&nbsp;did or didn't do and now they're at risk of being

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.140
criticised or embarrassed or punished.

00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:14.106
The&nbsp;CEO's in a bit of hot water about those comments

00:12:14.106 --> 00:12:16.104
that she made over the competitors.

00:12:16.776 --> 00:12:18.470
Okay your&nbsp;work is done.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.154
The day is over, it's time to go home.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.443
Then you can call it a day.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.165
I'm exhausted. Let's&nbsp;call it a day.

00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:30.875
Okay, I think it's time to call it a day.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.728
We'll finish the rest tomorrow.

00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:34.939
So there&nbsp;you have it, my friends!

00:12:34.939 --> 00:12:39.180
You just learned fifteen useful business idioms,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.059
all of them are essential to&nbsp;learn and to use at work.

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:47.218
The best way to do that, to learn and to use English idioms

00:12:47.218 --> 00:12:52.226
fluently&nbsp;is to think about when and how they might apply to you

00:12:52.226 --> 00:12:53.560
and to your work life.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.742
So for homework,&nbsp;I want you to choose five of the idioms

00:12:57.742 --> 00:13:00.608
that you learned in this lesson and tell me about

00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:04.361
your&nbsp;workplace and how these idioms relate to you

00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:06.463
down in the comments below.

00:13:06.463 --> 00:13:09.295
I'll make sure I get down&nbsp;there and I'll check them for you

00:13:09.295 --> 00:13:11.874
just to make sure that you're using these idioms in the

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.294
right&nbsp;context and in the right way.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.252
Thank you so much for joining me today,

00:13:16.252 --> 00:13:19.727
I will see you in this next&nbsp;lesson right here.

00:13:19.727 --> 00:13:20.880
I think you're gonna love it!
