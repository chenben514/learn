00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.020
Hello I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.420
Idioms are a very common part of the English language

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.840
and I'm sure I don't need to tell you

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.320
that they're challenging to learn and use.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.240
And that's because the meaning of the whole idiom

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.900
is often different to the individual meaning

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.600
of each word in it.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.800
But that's no reason to jump ship!

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.820
In this lesson, I'm going to share some fantastic idioms

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.780
that are all about sailing

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.100
and of course, they're idioms.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.280
So just because the word sail or sailing or ship or boat

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.620
appear in them,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.620
doesn't mean that you have to be on the water

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.900
while using them.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.740
They're all commonly used in every day situations

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.240
that have got nothing to do with sailing or boating at all!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.560
In fact,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.580
many of the idioms that I'll be sharing in this lesson are

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.480
frequently used when talking about work or colleagues,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.860
often in professional context or even if

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.020
you're talking casually about work.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.580
So let's dive in!

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.360
Starting with

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.380
to get someone on board or to be on board.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.940
Now usually, the term "on board" is used when you're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.340
travelling on a ship or on a plane.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.520
When you're on board, you're on the ship

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520
or you're on the plane.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.760
But this concept is also used to say that someone

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.860
agrees with an idea, an opinion or a plan

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.360
to get something done.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340
It's to get approval or support for something.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.140
It's a great idea,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.420
but you need to get Simon on board

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420
if you want to make it happen!

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.760
It's often used in business contexts

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.040
but it can be used informally

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.520
when you're trying to convince a friend to do something.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.840
We're thinking about hiring a car for the weekend

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.480
and driving down the coast, are you on board?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.660
That means do you agree with this or

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660
do you want to be involved?

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.380
To jump ship.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.280
Now, traditionally this expression was used on a boat

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.700
when a sailor left a ship without permission.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.400
But these days this idiom is often used

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300
when someone leaves a difficult situation

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.260
when really they should stay and deal with it.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.720
It can also be used when a person deserts someone

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720
or a group of people

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.320
leaving them to deal with a problem.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.120
If I got offered the same job but with a higher salary,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.160
of course I'd jump ship!

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.780
So I'd leave my current job and work for a company

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.460
that paid me more!

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.340
Of course I would!

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.840
I think that you should jump ship now

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.980
before the funding cuts are made!

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.980
In this context, the speaker is considering leaving the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.120
company that they work for and looking for another job.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.700
We need to offer our employees a competitive salary

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.620
otherwise they'll jump ship

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.920
and they'll be working for our competitors!

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.980
Smooth sailing.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.680
Now this phrase is used as an adjective

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.700
to say that something is easy or manageable.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.200
Progress is being made,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.700
everything is happening according to plan.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.520
We had some problems early on,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.060
but it's been smooth sailing

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.060
since we hired a project manager!

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.540
Great work everyone! But, it's not smooth sailing yet,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.400
we've still got two truckloads to unload before 9 o'clock!

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.040
That ship sailed.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.840
Now this idiom is used when an opportunity

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.900
has been missed

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.700
and it's too late to change the situation.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.660
Imagine that you bought tickets on an amazing cruise,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.200
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.300
and as you arrived at the port, to get on the ship,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.500
you see it sailing off into the sunset.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.440
You've missed it

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.120
and there is no chance

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.800
that you're getting on that boat now.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.600
That ship has sailed.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.060
And this context can be used or applied to any situation

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.560
where an opportunity is missed.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.880
More often than not,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.640
the words 'ship' and 'has' are contracted together

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.260
so it sounds like that ship sailed.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.280
It's disappointing,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.840
but we just need to accept that ship sailed

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.520
and move on.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.580
Since your ex-girlfriend has just got engaged,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.760
it's safe to say that ship sailed!

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.840
A sinking ship.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.980
That's not a good thing, a sinking ship!

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.140
Jump off before you go down with it!

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.320
A sinking ship is a company or an organisation

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.720
that is failing.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.640
The future is not looking good, it's doomed.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.740
As he left the management meeting,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.520
he realised he was on board a sinking ship.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.620
The company was in trouble

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.300
and there were serious problems

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.880
that could affect the company's operation.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.660
So it's a sinking ship.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.660
It sounds like you're on a sinking ship,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.540
I'd start looking for a new job if I was you.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
To run a tight ship.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.780
This idiom is used

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.520
to describe the way that a company or a team is run,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.620
managed by someone with very strict

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.620
but very effective rules.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.760
A person who runs a tight ship

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.080
doesn't allow mistakes to be made.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.340
Our boss runs a tight ship and she expects everyone

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.040
to work very hard.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.840
Now that Sue's left,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.280
it's become really obvious that she ran a tight ship.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.720
It's been absolute chaos without her!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.320
And lastly,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.900
enough to sink a ship.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.580
Can you imagine how much weight it takes

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.080
to sink a ship?

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.140
A lot!

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.680
So this idiom is used when you have more

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.160
than the amount that you need.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.860
At our family gatherings,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.840
there's always enough food to sink a ship!

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.940
A lot - way more than we ever need.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.040
Look at all that luggage... That's enough to sink a ship!

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.080
Well, who would have thought that there were so many

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.420
useful idioms about sailing?

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.860
And I want to know, are any of these idioms

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.380
similar to ones that you use in your own language?

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.060
Because often there are similarities

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.500
and that can make them a little easier to remember.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.840
Of course, if you enjoyed this lesson, well,
