00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.680
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.520
Now learning powerful words is really great

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.360
for your English vocabulary

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.500
but if you can't use them effectively,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.900
there's just not really much point is there?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.860
And when I say use them effectively, I mean use them

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.200
correctly in your sentences with the right

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.980
supporting words to help it sound natural

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.800
and relaxed and real.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.120
For many English nouns there are actually only a small

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.560
number of verbs that can frequently be used with them,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.560
words that just sound

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.220
right when they're used together in sentences

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.540
and we call these combinations of words 'collocations'.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.440
Now learning English collocations is so helpful

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.400
if you want to sound more natural and intelligent

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.380
when you speak and today it will

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.760
focus on a particular set of intelligent words

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.160
that will help you to talk about personal challenges.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.540
So these words are going to be incredibly powerful

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.040
in job interviews, in a professional context,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.280
when you're sitting exams, the times when you need to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.780
reflect on your personal life experiences.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.760
So if you're ready to expand your vocabulary,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.240
stick around!

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.740
Before we get started, a super quick reminder to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.040
turn on the subtitles down here if you need to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.200
and if you feel like doing something lovely today

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.360
then help me to translate this video so that

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.580
other people in your country can watch it

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.900
and can learn from it too and of course,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.040
it's going to be excellent English practice for you.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.540
I think it's fair to say that most of us are trying

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.480
to improve ourselves in some way.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.600
That's what you're doing here watching me, isn't it?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.260
Now we are always trying to learn new skills

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.380
and get better at things or

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.200
try to tweak and improve our personal qualities a little

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.980
to try and become better versions of ourselves.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.760
That's why we set goals, that's why we're conscious

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.320
or we're aware of the things that we're trying to improve.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.860
And this is called personal development.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.600
So I want to know

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.040
what are your personal goals right now?

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.460
What are you working on in yourself?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.080
For me, I'm trying to get conversational in Spanish

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.320
and I'm really trying to work on my management

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.880
and my leadership skills.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.080
See my team has grown really quickly over the last

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.540
twelve to eighteen months and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.360
you know, I want to be the best leader that I can be

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.260
for my team so I really want to improve these skills.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.240
So what about you? What are you working on?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.020
My aim in this lesson is to help you expand

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.100
your vocabulary around this topic and to help you to feel

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.580
more confident when you're using sophisticated

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.840
language in English.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.700
This vocabulary, it really is essential

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.160
if you need to use English professionally

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.900
or if you're planning to use English at university.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.680
These are all great words and expressions

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.880
to learn.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.340
When we're trying to improve ourselves,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.640
we've recognised that there's a problem,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.360
something's not working or something's blocking us

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.860
from getting to where we want to go

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.920
and we call this thing that's blocking us an obstacle.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.060
Now it can be a physical thing like a tree that's fallen

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.240
across a path

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.520
but it can also be a problem that prevents you or stops

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.360
you from achieving something that you want to do.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.360
So say you really want to apply for a job

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.680
but in the application they said that you need

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.900
five years of working experience.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.120
You only have two. So this is an obstacle,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.820
right? It's a problem. It's blocking you.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.420
It's not completely impossible to get around

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.660
that obstacle but you've got to work a little harder

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.480
to make it happen, right?

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.920
So 'obstacle' is a countable noun, you can have

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.840
an obstacle or you can have five obstacles

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840
and it's most commonly used with the verbs

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.460
hit, face and overcome.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.080
All of these verbs have slightly different meanings.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.300
We hit a significant obstacle

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.320
when we found out we had no budget left.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.760
So by using 'hit', we're highlighting that moment that

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.840
the obstacle stopped us, right?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.480
I can't even imagine the obstacles

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.220
you face in daily life.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.380
So here the verb 'face' is highlighting that moment

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.680
that you deal with the obstacle like you're looking at it

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.480
and you're standing there ready to take it on.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.080
She had to overcome many obstacles

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.540
on her journey to become CEO.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.840
And 'overcome' here, it highlights that moment you got

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.500
past the obstacle. It's not blocking you anymore.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.980
We use these same verbs with the noun 'challenge' too.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.140
And really that's just a synonym of 'obstacle'.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.280
When I created my online English learning community,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.780
I had no idea how many challenges I'd face

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.280
along the way.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.480
We've really overcome lots of challenges

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.780
to reach the point where we are today.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.040
We express this same idea by saying that we

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.360
we get over hurdles or we overcome hurdles.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.620
One of the biggest hurdles that we had to overcome

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.560
with our community was connecting them across

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.440
different time zones.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.300
So what about you? Have you had to overcome any

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.780
challenges in your job or in your personal life?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.320
I want you to practise using this language

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.600
in the comments below this video.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.840
Fears and doubts are things that hold us back.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.820
Often they are the reason why we don't

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.760
feel very confident at all.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.320
Our fears are our thoughts that we have when we're

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.760
frightened or we're worried about something,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.360
we fear that something bad will happen.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.680
And a doubt is a feeling of not being certain

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.920
about something,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.500
being unsure about what will happen.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.440
So we have doubts about our ability to do things,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.800
about our choices, the decisions that we've made.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.340
I have some doubts about our ability to complete this

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.380
project by Christmas.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.080
In fact, you can use self-doubt here to make it

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.500
clear that the doubts you have are with yourself.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.860
Now we often use the verb 'overcome' again with 'doubt'

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.340
and with 'self-doubt'

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.080
and we use it to say, you know, when we stopped

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.660
feeling uncertain. It's also really useful to practise

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.160
the verb 'doubt' as well.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.660
There were so many times when I doubted

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.060
my ability to lead a team.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.100
Let's focus on fear for a minute or two.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.680
We all have to deal with fear, right? We have to learn

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.180
how to manage fear.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.480
It's a really natural and a really normal part of life.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.120
If we're lucky enough, we find a way to harness fear

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.900
in some situations.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.740
Have you heard of that expression?

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.700
Now we use the verb 'harness' when you find a way

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.740
to use that fear to your advantage.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.480
The energy from that fear gives you the power

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.660
to do something courageous or challenging

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.340
and we actually often use that verb 'harness'

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.620
with an emotion. We use it to say that we bring

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.080
that emotion under control

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.600
and then do something positive with it.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.240
So for example. You might harness

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.920
your team's enthusiasm which means, you know,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.480
you want to make the most of their enthusiasm

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.400
and get the best out of them.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.680
We all have fears but what about those moments

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.760
when we find the courage?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.860
We face our fears. We let our fears come right up to us

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.460
and we stand our ground

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.840
and we deal with those fears, right?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.840
I got called up on stage and at that moment,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.740
I was forced to face my fears.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.340
Okay let's not dwell on our problems and our fears

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.700
for too long, we all like a happy ending, don't we?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.380
So how can we flip these negative situations

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.500
and begin to make them more positive?

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.620
Well let's focus on some vocabulary

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.540
that will help you to do that.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.380
You're all familiar with the word 'opportunity' right?

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.540
You can be given an opportunity.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.760
You can receive an opportunity.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.880
You can get an opportunity.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.320
But what if you want to emphasise your role

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.280
in getting that opportunity?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.300
It's much more powerful to say that you took

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.740
the opportunity or you grabbed the opportunity.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.300
It tells us that you were in control of the situation.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.800
I grabbed the opportunity

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.220
to introduce myself to the CEO.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.220
Now an even stronger word is the verb 'seize'.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.400
So this is when you take something really eagerly.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.560
I want to make sure our team

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.160
seizes these opportunities in the future.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.580
You can create an opportunity as well

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.380
and this suggests that you made it possible

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.680
through your actions to have that opportunity.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.040
You can take advantage of an opportunity.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.320
And that's when you take that opportunity

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.560
and use it for your own gain.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.740
When my boss announced his resignation,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.480
I took advantage of the situation and presented

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.240
my paper at the conference in his place.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.800
Good way to take advantage of a situation.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.600
How many times has something or someone

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.580
changed the way that you think about something

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.340
or changed your point of view?

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.600
Well it sounds much more intelligent to say

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.940
"change your perspective"

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.500
or explain that something shifted your perspective.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.220
So your perspective is a more intelligent way

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.660
to talk about your way of thinking about things.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.480
And the verb 'shift' is used to say that something

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.800
moved slightly.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.520
Working with high school students helped him to shift

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.720
his perspective on the attitudes

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.100
and work ethic of young people.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.800
Okay we have to talk about the word 'potential' here,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.620
one of my favourite words because it's

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.440
full of possibility. It talks about the possibility to achieve

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.580
something in the future.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.220
And the future is full of possibility.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.500
It's full of potential. And when something that was once

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.560
possible but is now true or real, we use the verb

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.440
'realise' with 'potential' here.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.700
I realised his potential

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.740
as soon as he came into the interview.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.160
We also use this verb with 'dream'.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.080
My boss helped me to realise a long-term dream;

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
to present at an international conference.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.880
So this is a much more professional way of saying that,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.940
you know, you made your dreams come true.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.500
So can you tell me about a time that you

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.180
seized an opportunity or you realised a dream?

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.580
I'm really excited to see you using some of these words

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.180
and collocations in the comments below.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.100
I'll be coming down to check them out

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.420
and give you some feedback on them soon.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.260
Now I always make a point of giving feedback

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.620
and writing comments for the first few days

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.000
after my videos have been published

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.640
so if you want feedback on your sentences

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.140
then write them now

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.760
right when we're first watching this video.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.880
And make sure that you're subscribed

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.680
with the notifications on so that you don't miss out

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.720
on any of my future lessons

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.440
and opportunities to get feedback.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.640
If you want to keep practising with me,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.520
you know where to go.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.640
I'll see you in there!
