Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.850
Do you have a fear of public speaking?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.660
Let me help you.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.529
Have you ever needed to give a speech in your
native language?

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.689
How about in English?

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:27.009
A very nonprofessional study I did of my friends
show that 99.99% of people have a fear of

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.089
giving a speech in public.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.870
If you are part of that 0.01% you can go ahead
and leave.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.679
But oh, okay, I see everyone is still there,
all right.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.109
Today I'd like to give you some more tools
in your public speaking toolbox to help you

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.109
feel more comfortable and confident when you
give a presentation or when you speak in public.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.449
To be a confident public speaker, you need
to bring your A game.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.760
When you bring your A game, that means that
you are bringing the best part of yourself

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
forward.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.570
You are doing your best.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.199
So let's talk about three skills that you
need.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.890
In order to bring your A game, you need to
bring your body game, your mental game, and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.080
your preparation game.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.810
To help you bring your A game, I am going
to give you a little presentation.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.970
This is going to be a public speaking practice
for me, but it's also a presentation about

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.470
the way you can best bring your A game.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.690
Are you ready?

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.710
Let's go.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.250
Let's start by talking about your body game.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.310
When you give a presentation, how are your
shoulders?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.070
Are they hunched forward, are they back?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.110
Do you feel like you're standing up tall?

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.470
How about your spine?

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.350
Is it leaning over or do you feel like you're
reaching tall to the sky?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.450
So one of the most popular TED Talks on YouTube
is from a lady called Amy Cuddy.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.310
And she was talking about how your posture
affects how other people see you.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.540
But it's also how you see yourself.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.960
So when you are giving a presentation like
this, or even if you stand like this, you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.150
feel smaller and less important.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.530
If you stand strong, other people will feel
like that too.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.500
But most importantly you will feel like that.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.820
So that's why we're talking about your body
game first, so that you can prepare your body

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.370
with good posture, which will also affect
your mind.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.340
When you walk into a conference room to give
a speech, are you walking like this, kind

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.100
of hunched over and not sure of yourself trying
to feel a little bit smaller?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.820
Or are you standing straight and tall and
confident?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.740
Even if you don't feel like it, it's good
to have posture like that.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.870
You don't have to walk in like some kind of
overconfident gorilla, being a little bit

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.870
crazy.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.590
But being confident with your posture, even
a little bit, will make a big difference.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.450
The next part is your mental game.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.900
So we've already talked about your body game,
making sure that your body and your posture

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.270
is the best it can be.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.950
But what about what's going on inside your
head?

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.600
Well, when you are prepared and ready and
thinking positively about your presentation,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.380
it's already the best start.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.650
I want you to focus your mind being positive.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.350
This is easier for some people than for other
people.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.740
Some people are naturally more positive and
some people are naturally more negative about

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.300
things in their life.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.050
So I have one big tip that will help you to
be a little bit more positive.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.270
When you're giving a presentation, whether
it's in front of a big crowd of people or

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.260
just a couple of people or just a business
presentation, try to focus on how your presentation

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.110
will help other people.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.140
When you focus on helping other people and
meeting their needs, you're less likely to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.420
be stressed about it yourself.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.140
So I challenge you to think about how will
this marketing presentation affect the people

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.140
I'm talking with?

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.230
If you think, "Okay, my presentation will
help them to get a better marketing plan and

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.920
will sell more," then you're already feeling
a little bit more positive.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.380
For those of you that really struggle with
negative self talk.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.500
So this mental game section is really tough
for you.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.160
I challenge you every morning, especially
right before you're about to give a presentation,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.520
to create some kind of short and easy positive
sentence.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.670
Sometimes we call that an affirmation and
that means that you're thinking about something

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.459
that will positively affect your mind and
usually that's how your presentation will

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.540
affect other people.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.500
So maybe in the morning when you wake up,
two days before your presentation, you say,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.189
"My marketing presentation will help us to
sell more products."

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.219
This is super simple and it's not really fancy.

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:24.460
But when you say that to yourself with a deep
breath, "My marketing presentation will help

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.960
us to sell more products."

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.040
Super simple, hopefully it's true.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.960
You're focusing on the positive things, the
impact that your presentation will have instead

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.169
of the mistakes that you'll make, and all
of those things that make us feel really nervous.

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.879
The third game is the preparation game.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.999
Now, this is the one that a lot of us focus
on the most.

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:46.499
Writing the speech, making sure we have the
best pictures on our PowerPoint, all of that.

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:47.740
But do you know what?

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.310
Sometimes we overlook actually saying the
speech out loud and preparing it verbally.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.199
If English is your native language, usually
it's recommended that you practice your speech

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.509
three times.

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.990
But if English is not your native language
and imagine if you are watching this, it's

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.699
probably not.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.939
It is best to do it more than three times.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.150
Three times is not enough.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.020
This is my recommendation.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.190
Practice your speech through twice, practice
your intonation, the way that you say it.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.660
Make sure that you have all the words exactly
the way that you'd like them and then on the

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.419
third try, I challenge you to record yourself.

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.550
You could just record your voice.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.110
That's a good first step, but because we've
already talked about how your body and your

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.639
mental game are also really important, I challenge
you to record yourself with your phone.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.639
You can just set it up.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.020
It could be really simple and practice the
speech in front of the camera.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.650
And then go back, watch that as if you were
the audience as if you were your coworkers

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.880
sitting and watching your presentation.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.259
Or if you're giving a speech in front of a
big group of people, imagine that you're the

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.499
audience.

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:50.560
How are you with the audience?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.469
Are you engaging, looking at them?

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.009
Are you feeling really nervous?

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.880
And you can see, "Oh, I'm stuttering a lot,
I'm shaking a lot."

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.589
Try to assess your body and your words as
if you were the audience.

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:07.089
After you've recorded yourself, I want you
to practice it two more times and this is

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:11.210
going to help you to just level up your skills,
you've already kind of assessed or critique

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.210
yourself.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.069
So those two other times should be way better
than the first two times that you did it.

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:22.259
What do you think that a professional athlete
does on the day of their big game?

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.669
Do you think that they watch some TV and kind
of just sit around?

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.469
No, they do not distract themselves from their
objective, which is winning that game.

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.990
So this is what I want you to do on the day
that you have a presentation.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:42.569
Let's say you have a presentation at 3:00
PM, when you go to work, focus on that presentation,

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.210
review it, do everything that you can for
that presentation.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.419
I want to give you a quick example about this
guy, Ryan Suter, he's a hockey player.

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:56.439
He has a very strict game day routine and
I think it's a good way to see that professional

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:00.349
athletes are not distracted on the day of
their big game because they want to fulfill

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:01.349
their potential.

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:03.119
They want to do the best that they can.

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:07.389
So you can also kind of imitate his style,
on the day of his big game, he goes to the

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:12.090
skating rink, skates a little bit, talks with
his coaches, they have a meeting with the

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.090
team.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.629
Then his team goes out to lunch, he orders
the same thing.

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:17.240
You don't need to do that, it's a little extreme.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.339
But he orders the same thing every time.

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:24.569
And then after that, takes a quick nap and
he goes back to the rink and talks with his

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:30.319
coworkers or his teammates and he talks with
the coaches and he gets a chance to kind of

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.720
mentally prepare for the game.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.050
Then they go on the ice, they practice and
they have the game.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.830
Did he do anything that day that wasn't related
to hockey?

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.229
Not really, except eat and take a nap, which
is kind of necessary for life.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.949
So I want you, if you have a big presentation
and you especially feel really nervous about

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:49.250
it, focus on nothing else that day.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.589
Try to surround... do everything that you
can possible for that speech on the date to

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:56.220
get your mind ready, to prepare yourself.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.080
So on the day of your big presentation, I
want you to not distract yourself, don't have

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.110
friends over for lunch and talk about other
things.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.059
Focus on your presentation, visualize it going
well.

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:12.070
Everyone's responding positively, you're having
a great time, they're understanding, they're

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.349
learning a lot, and your speech is helping
them to improve their goals.

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:21.080
So in conclusion, to bring your A game to
your presentation, you need to bring your

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:28.449
body game, great posture, your mental game,
positive thoughts, and your preparation game,

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:29.569
active practice.

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:33.060
So thank you so much for this quick presentation.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.149
Thank you for learning with me.

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:38.440
I hope that your presentation skills will
increase and improve from here.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.669
How did you enjoy that presentation?

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.870
My presentation skills are not perfect.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:48.590
My speaking style is not perfect, but I want
to bring you a professional.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.750
Someone who knows a lot more about public
speaking than me.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.759
So if you would like to dig deeper into this
topic of having confidence when you give a

00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:02.079
speech in public, I invite you to join me
in my course, The Fearless Fluency Club.

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:07.430
This month you're going to meet Nathan, who's
one of the organizers of a local group called

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.750
Toastmasters.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.740
Toastmasters is a nonprofit international
organization that helps anyone in the community

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:19.360
who wants to participate, to learn to speak
better and more confidently in front of others.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.490
I also visited Nathan's toastmaster meeting
here in my city.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.100
So if you join The Fearless Fluency Club this
month, you'll get access to my conversation

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.500
with Nathan about public speaking skills,
some of the positive things he's learned,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.730
some of the negative things he's learned.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.250
And you'll also get access to a Toastmasters
meeting.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.610
I went to this meeting and I recorded it,
so you can kind of get a sneak preview into

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.670
what a Toastmasters' meeting is like.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.319
It was actually a lot of fun.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:50.250
So if you would like to learn more about public
speaking, feel free to join me in The Fearless

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.250
Fluency Club.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.310
And make sure that you write the word new
in the coupon code section, so that you can

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.120
get the first 30 days of the course for only
$5.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.120
The regular price is $35 per month.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.700
But if you write the word new, you'll get
it for just $5 for the first month.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.640
Now I have a question for you.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.529
Have you ever given a speech in English?

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:14.080
Have you ever given a speech in your own language?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.490
Let me know in the comments below.
