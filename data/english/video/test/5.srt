Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa, from SpeakingEnglishwithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.960
Do you know any business idioms or phrasal
verbs?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.640
Let's talk about them.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.769
Today you're going to learn three business
phrasal verbs and three business idioms.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.609
But as you might know, a lot of the videos
on my channel are about conversational English.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.579
So when I wanted to make a video about business
English, I thought, "Who are some experts

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.510
who can help me with professional English
expressions?"

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.510
A-ha.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.179
I have a great solution for you.

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:43.949
Today, I'm joined with Leila and Sabrah from
Love English; the Love English YouTube channel.

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.370
They are university English teachers.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.109
So, every day they help students with professional,
polite English.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.251
Whether that is passing an important English
exam, so that you can get a promotion, so

00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.949
that you can get a better job, so that you
get a Visa to go to another country, they

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.110
are experts at this kind of professional,
polite English.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.450
Make sure that after you watch this video,
you check out the link in the description

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.000
to the lesson that we did on their channel
about the top English interview questions

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and answers.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.220
This is a fun, entertaining and useful lesson
that we did together.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.310
It's really great to work with other English
teachers, and I hope that it will be to your

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.310
benefit.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.570
Sabrah: Hello, everybody.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.920
We're Love English.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.920
I'm Sabrah.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.920
Leila: And I'm Leila.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.880
Sabrah: Thank you so much, Vanessa, for having
us on your channel and asking us to help you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.939
out with explaining some of these business
expressions and idioms.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.689
Leila: So, we are British, if you can't tell.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.820
Our accents are British, and we've got a flag,
just to help you recognize where we're from.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.630
We are real teachers.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.479
We teach at a British University college.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.979
We help students go to university and improve
their language.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.799
Sabrah: Thank you so much, Vanessa.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.960
Let's get on with the expressions.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.439
Vanessa: The first phrasal verb that we're
going to talk about is: To go over something.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.530
The first idiom is: To cut corners.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.520
Leila and Sabrah, how would you use these
in professional business situations?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.550
To go over something.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.350
To go over something.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.170
Leila: Let's start with a phrasal verb: To
go over something.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.540
A very common phrasal verb, isn't it, Sabrah?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.570
Sabrah: Yes, it is.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.570
Definitely, yeah.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.040
Leila: When we go over something, we review.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.330
Often a document or a plan, or even a business
proposal.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.610
So, it means to review and look at in detail
to make sure there's no problems.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.690
Sabrah: So, if you want somebody to check
something at work you might say, "Can you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.830
go over this for me?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.870
I'm not sure about these numbers.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.150
Could you go over the figures?"

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.150
Leila: Perfect example.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.620
Yes, figures is something, and numbers.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.720
Sabrah: Yes, and numbers.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.650
Vanessa: To cut corners.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.750
To cut corners.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.790
Sabrah: An idiom that kind of means that opposite
is, to cut corners.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.070
To cut corners means to reduce the amount
of time or money spent on doing something.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.580
Often, it ends up that you don't do such a
good job because you've cut corners.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.580
Vanessa: Yes, exactly.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.980
Sabrah: So, for example, if you cut corners
when you're a student learning English, you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.360
might get someone else to help you write your
essays.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.760
Yeah, you go the quick way, but it might not
necessarily mean that you do such a good job

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.660
or that you learn as much.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.520
How would we use it in business, Leila?

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.360
Leila: In business you may try and cut corners
when it comes to a project that you are investing

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.360
in.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.120
So you might want to save some money and maybe
not have as many members of staff that you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.440
need, which means that the job really isn't
as good as it should be.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.750
Sabrah: So generally it's a bit of a negative
thing, guys, to cut corners.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.470
I hope you guys aren't doing that.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.090
Vanessa: Thanks so much for going over these
important expressions.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.950
You certainly didn't cut any corners.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.340
The next expressions that we're going to talk
about are: To come up, and, better late than

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.340
never.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.540
Leila and Sabrah, how would you use these?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.790
To come up.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.790
To come up.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.790
Leila: Okay.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.020
Another phrase that you will probably hear
in the office is to come up.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.400
Something comes up.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.760
And this just simply means that another situation
arises.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.960
To come up means to rise.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.310
Another situation arises and you need to delay
what you are doing.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.650
So you may have planned to have a meeting,
but something might come up.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.959
You might get caught in a business phone call
that you have to take and you can't go to

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.959
the meeting.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.959
Sabrah: Yeah.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:23.959
"So sorry.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:24.959
This opportunity has come up.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:25.959
I can't miss it."

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.090
Things like that.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.000
Sometimes people will leave a meeting early
because they'll say, "I'm really sorry, but

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.960
actually something more important has come
up.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960
I have to leave.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960
I'm so sorry."

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960
Things like that.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.550
So yes, it is very, very common in the workplace.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.439
And it happens unexpectedly, really.

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.350
Vanessa: Better late than never.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.629
Better late than never.

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:45.629
Sabrah: Right.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.639
This one, guys, actually it's a great expression.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.639
Leila: It is.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.639
Sabrah: Because I actually say it.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.639
Leila: Yes, you do.

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.740
Sabrah: I tend to be a bit of a late person.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.659
I'm not the best with time management.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.699
Leila knows.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.710
So I will often say, better late than never.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.770
Leila: No, I'll say it when you turn up late.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.830
Sabrah: Yeah, that's true, actually.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.030
Leila: "Oh, sorry, Leila.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.030
I'm late."

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.030
"Oh, all right.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.030
Better late than never."

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.710
Sabrah: So it means it's better to arrive
than to never come, to never arrive.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.669
So yes, I think it's very easy to understand
that one, better late than never.

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.319
Leila: It's not just talking about arriving,
though.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.370
That's a great example.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.330
But it is meaning things like waiting for
a telephone call.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.949
It might mean you're waiting for somebody
to come back with an answer about a project.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.770
Sabrah: Yes, coming in then.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.580
Leila: Yeah, you're expecting something.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.659
Sabrah: Yes, exactly.

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.840
Vanessa: Thanks for that great explanation.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.639
The next time that something comes up and
you're late, you can say, "Well, better late

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.810
than never."

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.319
The next two expressions that we're going
to talk about are: to wrap up, and call it

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.479
a day.

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.220
Leila and Sabrah, what do these mean?

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.020
To wrap up something.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.580
To wrap up something.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.050
Leila: Another phrase with that, actually,
I would say we maybe use a little bit less

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.570
here in the U.K. but definitely I've heard
the Americans use this phrase ...

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.919
Sabrah: It's very big in America, yeah.

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.050
Leila: To wrap things up.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.229
And basically it means to bring things to
a close, to finish.

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.070
So if we're in a meeting, you might say, "All
right, let's ..."

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.070
Sabrah: "Let's wrap things up, guys.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.070
That's it.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.939
We don't have any more time now, let's wrap
it up."

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.139
Leila: You might also be working on a project
with somebody and you might say, "Okay.

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.180
Let's do this, this and this, and then wrap
things up."

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.211
Sabrah: It's also used very often in the film
making industry.

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:23.211
Leila: It is.

00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:25.249
Sabrah: They say, "And that's a wrap," when
it's finished.

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.249
Yes.

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:28.919
Not so much in business, but definitely used
in Hollywood.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.379
Vanessa: To call it a day.

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.740
To call it a day.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.740
Sabrah: Okay.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.529
So an idiom for this is, "Let's call it a
day."

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.970
Let's call it a day means that's it now.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.970
Let's call it a day.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.970
The day has finished.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.400
So the working day is over.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.909
Let's call it the end of the day, for example.

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:47.909
Very common.

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:48.909
We say this to each other, actually.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:49.909
Vanessa: We say it, yeah, yeah.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.529
Sabrah: After we've been filming for Love
English, we'll go, "Phew ..."

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:52.529
Leila: "Let's call it a day."

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.319
Sabrah: "We've done enough now so let's just
call it a day."

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.599
So it just means that's it.

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.309
The day is finished, let's go home.

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:59.309
Leila: All right, guys.

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:04.509
We are going to call it a day now, and thank
you and Vanessa for watching this lesson and

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:06.800
joining us on this great collaboration.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.439
Sabrah: Thank you so much for having us, again,
Vanessa, and hello to all your audience.

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:14.009
It's great to get to know you guys a little
bit.

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.800
Thank you so much for having us, and good
luck in all your business meetings.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800
Leila: Absolutely.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.969
Sabrah: Don't cut any corners, and make sure
you go over things very carefully.

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:22.100
Vanessa: All right.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.300
Let's wrap up this lesson.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.969
It's time to call it a day.

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:30.849
Let me know in the comments below this lesson,
were any of these phrasal verbs or idioms

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.120
new to you?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.729
Do you ever cut corners?

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:35.849
When did something come up?

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:39.029
What time are you ready to call it a day at
your job?

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:44.189
Thank you so much for joining me in this special
video with Leila and Sabrah from Love English.

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:48.339
Make sure you check out the other video we
did together on their channel about the top

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:52.189
interview questions and how to answer them
and how not to answer them.

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:55.349
You can click on the link in the description
or up here.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:58.580
Thanks so much for joining me and I'll see
you again next Friday.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.720
Bye.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.839
The next step is to download my free e-book.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:06.120
Five steps to becoming a confident English
