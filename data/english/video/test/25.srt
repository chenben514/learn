Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.740
I'd rather, I prefer, which one is more natural?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.690
Let's talk about it.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.230
Today, I want to talk to you about the natural
expression, I would rather or I'd rather.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.689
Maybe you remember from elementary school
English classes, learning the phrase, "Which

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.439
do you prefer, chocolate or vanilla?

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.189
I prefer chocolate."

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.410
This expression, the sentence, this question,
it's okay, but it's not really something that

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.780
we use very commonly in daily conversation.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.600
I don't want to tell you that native speakers
never use the word prefer, we do use the word

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.070
prefer, but today, I want to give you another
expression that you can use to build your

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.010
vocabulary and have some more variety to sound
like a native speaker.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.740
Here's what I recommend instead.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.489
"Do you want to eat at the Japanese or Italian
place tonight?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.670
I'd rather eat sushi, so let's go to the Japanese
place."

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.860
This construction is I'd rather, plus a verb.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.280
"I'd rather eat sushi.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.290
Let's go to the Japanese place."

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.300
Or you can ask, "Vanessa, why don't you live
in New York City?

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.350
Why did you choose North Carolina when you
could live in New York City?"

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.330
I might say, "I'd rather not live somewhere
that cold."

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.110
This construction with the negative, we need
to add not before the verb.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.810
"I'd rather not live somewhere that cold."

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.890
I'd rather not.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.281
Last year, when we moved back to the US after
living in Korea for three years, my husband

00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:55.229
and I didn't know which city we wanted to
live in.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.640
I said that I'd rather not live in the city
where I grew up and my husband, Dan, said

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.890
the same thing about the city he grew up in,
so we had to make a list and decide what were

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.400
our priorities.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.730
What did want in a city that we would live
in for the next few years?

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.849
We sat down and made a list and I said that
I'd rather walk or bike than drive, because

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.310
I feel healthier, I enjoy walking, I enjoy
biking, and driving just isn't my thing.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.590
It was important to have a city that had a
nice downtown area that we could hopefully

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.680
live close to.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.160
For Dan, he said that he'd rather have a place
with down to earth people.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.580
Not, maybe, high class type of people.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.740
He wanted somewhere where we could fit in,
and meet friends who were similar to us.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.220
In the end, we found two different cities.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.250
One city was five hours from my husband's
family, six hours from my family, and a little

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.910
bit further north.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.290
But, the second city was only one hour from
my family and eight hours, maybe seven hours

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.550
from my husband's family.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:14.560
In the end, we decided that we'd rather live
close to one family than far from both families.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.790
In the end, we decided to live in Asheville,
North Carolina, which is where I live now.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.250
It was a great choice.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.330
The weather is nice.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.110
The people are down to earth.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.390
We can walk to the downtown area.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.379
I can walk to the grocery store.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.530
In the end, we got what we wanted.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.340
It's a great place to visit because we were
really intentional and we tried to choose

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.470
this place carefully.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.780
On my website, I'm going to write some more
sample sentences and details about the expression,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.989
I'd rather.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.180
Now, I have a question for you.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.600
Can you make a sample sentence using today's
expression, I'd rather?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.760
I'd love to see your comment in the questions
below and I'll talk to you the next time.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.939
Goodbye.
