00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.020
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.430
Do you want to be polite?

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.600
Let's talk about it.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.660
Everyone wants to be polite, right?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.219
Well, most people.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.940
Sometimes you have a small favor to ask someone.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.260
"Could you open the door?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.750
My hands are full."

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.930
Or maybe you have a big favor to ask someone.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.240
"By any chance, could you feed my cats over
the weekend while I'm gone?"

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.509
You need to use the correct polite expressions
for each of these situations to continue having

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.899
good relationships with people around you.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.969
Today, we're going to focus on the top 10
polite expressions that you can use in daily

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:40.969
life.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.749
I use these all the time, and so can you.

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:48.350
I'm from the U.S., and when I studied abroad
in the UK, I found this funny survival guide

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.920
to how to live in the UK, and this was one
of the images in that survival guide.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.739
On one side you can see the man is drowning
and he says, "Help!" and it says "This is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.739
wrong.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.699
You shouldn't say this," and on the other
side it says, "Excuse me, sir.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.060
I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but I wonder
if you would mind helping me for a moment,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.280
as long as it's no trouble, of course."

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.869
Do you think this is realistic?

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.869
Of course not.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.470
This is an exaggeration of British culture.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.250
It's not true in the UK, it's not true in
the U.S., but it is nice to include some polite

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.090
expressions, not when you're drowning, you
can say, "Help, help, help!" of course, but

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.750
in daily life it's great to use a few polite
expressions.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.100
Let's talk about them.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.259
The first seven polite phrases are great for
asking a favor.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.960
A favor is when you're asking someone to do
something for you.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.460
The first one is using could or would.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.840
They are both exactly the same.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.439
Could you do me a favor?

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.960
Would you help me?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.740
Would you please tell me where the closest
subway station is?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.429
Can you use can in these situations?

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.759
Maybe if you're with some close friends and
you're asking them to do something simple

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.990
like, "Can you pass me that paper?"

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.929
"Can you look at the GPS while I drive?"

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.069
That's fine.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.459
But if you want to take it up to the next
level, you could say could or would.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.930
That was a pretty basic expression, so let's
go on to some more advanced ones.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.310
Expression number two is "If you don't mind,
would you help put the dishes in the dishwasher?"

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.489
"If you don't mind, would you" something.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.840
"If you don't mind" means if it doesn't bother
you, but make sure that you don't say, "If

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.630
you don't care, would you put the dishes in
the dishwasher?"

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.590
The word care is a little too strong and can
seem kind of rude, so make sure you say, "If

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.250
you don't mind, would you help put the dishes
in the dishwasher?"

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.849
I have a good friend that often comes over
to dinner at our house, and after dinner,

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.540
Dan and I are busy putting Theo, our toddler,
to bed.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.040
The process, bath and reading books and all
of this, takes about 30 minutes.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.120
And because she's my good friend, I don't
asking her, "If you don't mind, would you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.829
help put the dishes away in the dishwasher
while we're putting Theo to bed?"

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.180
This is a great thing to ask.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.190
Expression number three, "If it's not a problem,
could I, or can I, call you back in 10 minutes?"

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.530
Dan and I just moved into a new house, and
on our moving day, as we were moving things

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.680
into the house, our realtor called.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.400
A realtor is someone who helps you to buy
a house.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.190
She said it wasn't an emergency, and things
were kind of hectic because we were moving

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.240
lots of boxes in, so I used this expression,
"If it's not a problem, could I call you back

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.680
in 10 minutes?"

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.209
You can also use can here.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.930
"If it's not a problem, can I call you back
in 10 minutes?"

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.930
Beautiful.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.099
Expression number four, "When you have a moment,
can you, could you email me those documents?"

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.180
or "When you get a second, can you email me
those documents, could you email me those

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
documents?"

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.970
I have a tax accountant who helps me to process
my taxes, and this is a sentence that I used

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.209
in an email with him.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.980
"When you have a moment, can you email me
those documents?"

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.180
He's a pretty chill, relaxed guy, and so happy.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.459
I don't know how anyone who does taxes can
be so happy, but he always is, and I asked

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.250
him, "When you have a moment, can you email
me those documents?"

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.580
You can also use the word get here.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.890
Get is more common in spoken English.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.160
You can use have or get in spoken English,
but we don't often write the word get.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.940
"When you get a second, can you email me those
documents, could you email me those documents?"

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.930
It's more common to use get in spoken English.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.450
Expression number five, "If you get a chance,
could you water our plants too?"

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.450
When Dan and I are gone for a couple days,
we ask our neighbor to watch our cats, and

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.250
this is an expression that I often use if
I forget to ask the neighbor to do something.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.570
"If you get a chance, could you water our
plants too?"

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.090
This means that it is not necessary, "if you
get a chance," because they might not get

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.720
a chance, or they probably will, but it's
just saying it's not necessary.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.140
Feeding our cats is necessary.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.800
They have to do that.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.300
But watering the plants is not necessary for
a few days, so you can use this.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.150
"If you get a chance, could you water our
plants?"

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.940
Make sure when you use this expression that
it's for something that is not necessary,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.630
because they might not do it, or you can just
use it to say, "Hey, I know I'm asking you

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.700
something extra.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.600
It's not necessary, but if you get a chance,
could you do this?"

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.490
If you have a necessary task that you want
to ask someone, just change one word.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.510
Say, "When you get a chance, could you check
our mail, when you get a chance?"

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.760
If you're gone for a week, it's necessary
to take the mail from your mailbox and put

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.760
it in your house.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.000
It's necessary for the mailman.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.450
It's necessary for you.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.730
So you could just say "when you get a chance."

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.860
You're not saying do it now.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.550
You're just saying, "When you get a chance,
could you put my mail on the table?

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.560
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you."

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.740
This is really polite, and it shows that it
needs to be done when you get a chance.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.600
It's not if you get a chance, but when you
get a chance, could you do this?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.880
Super polite.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.260
Expression number six, "By any chance, could
you give me a ride home from work today?"

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.260
This is really polite.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.370
I use this one a lot.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.290
In fact, maybe if your car is in the shop,
in the shop means at the mechanic, if your

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.220
car is in the shop and you don't have a ride
home, you might approach your coworker and

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.280
say, "By any chance, could you give me a ride
home from work today?"

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:48.010
It's usually for a big task or something that
you know will be something important or big

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.140
for the other person to do, so you can use
this to say, "Oh, by any chance, could you

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.450
give me a ride home from work today?"

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:02.590
Sentence number seven, "I'd appreciate it
if you would have the report done by this

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.590
afternoon."

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.710
Be careful with this one.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.190
You can only use this if you are the boss,
if you are the teacher.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.780
Do not use this with someone who is your equal.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.840
Do not say this to your husband, your wife,
your coworker.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.300
"I'd appreciate it if you would finish that
report by this afternoon."

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.930
You could only use this if you're in a position
of authority.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.890
This word, appreciate, is different than "I
appreciate it.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.930
Thank you."

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.690
We can use that to just say, simply, thank
you.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.210
"Oh, you bought me some flowers.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.840
I appreciate it."

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:41.880
But when you say, "I'd appreciate it," this
means I would appreciate it if you'd finish

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.360
that report.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.920
This is showing that you need them to do something,
and you're kind of politely commanding them

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920
to do something.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.300
So if you are the boss, this is a polite expression
you can use to tell someone, "Hey, I need

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.380
you to do this, I need you to do this by this
afternoon, but I want to tell it to you in

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.380
a polite way."

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.100
"I'd appreciate it if you'd have that report
done by this afternoon."

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100
Good.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.380
Make sure you use a polite tone of voice.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.010
The next three phrases are for giving suggestions.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.410
Number eight, "What if we reschedule for another
day because it's raining today?"

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.660
My father-in-law is an engineer, and he often
has clients and customers and people from

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:26.000
other departments visiting from Japan, China,
France, Germany, and when they come to his

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.900
office, they often take those people out to
play golf.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.430
I've never worked in a company like this,
so I haven't experienced this, but he said

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.529
it's pretty common for his company.

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:39.909
So if it's raining that day that they plan
to play golf, he might say this.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.870
"What if we reschedule for another day because
it's raining today?"

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.899
He's giving a suggestion, but it's also pretty
direct in a polite way.

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:53.700
Number nine, "How about if we go out to eat
instead?"

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.209
Let's imagine that you're the one who's visiting
my father-in-law's company, and it's raining.

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:01.509
You plan to play golf, but you can't because
it's raining.

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:05.660
He might say to you, "How about if we go out
to eat instead?"

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.720
He's presenting another alternative.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.279
He's suggesting something else.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:15.399
The other day, Dan asked me what I wanted
to do in the afternoon, and I said, "Well,

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.350
we could go to the park, but we always go
to the park.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.689
How about if we go to the creek and we splash
around in the water, because Theo loves to

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:25.199
do that and it's the perfect summer activity?"

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:26.639
I was suggesting something.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:31.399
"How about if we go to the creek and play
in the water?"

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:36.120
Even though Dan is my husband, we're not in
a business relationship...

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.800
Well, he does help me with these English lessons,
but we're not technically in an office in

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.569
this kind of relationship.

00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:44.570
So I could use this in a personal way as well.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.459
It doesn't have to be just in a business situation.

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:49.829
"How about if we go to the creek?"

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:52.959
I'm just presenting, suggesting something
else.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:57.959
Polite expression number 10, "What do you
think about this place?"

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:02.790
This is a little bit more indirect because
you're asking what someone thinks.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.959
You're not directly suggesting something else.

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:10.160
So let's take a look at some of those scenarios
that we just talked about, using this expression,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.450
so that you can see the difference.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.950
"What do you think about rescheduling our
golf game?"

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.350
"What do you think about eating out instead
of going to play golf?"

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.649
"What do you think about playing in the creek?"

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:25.079
I'm asking, "What do you think about this?"

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:30.060
I'm not saying, "I want to do this," so it's
pretty indirect, but it's another polite way

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.550
to give a suggestion.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.680
I have two bonus miscellaneous polite expressions
that I'd like to share with you.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.850
This is number 11, bonus expression, "You
should probably check the oven because I smell

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.610
something burning."

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.990
If you come to my house and you're about to
eat dinner, but you smell something burning,

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:54.620
you might use this to politely say, "You should
probably," probably here is our polite word,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.399
"You should probably check the oven because
I smell something burning."

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:01.339
Great way to ask someone to do something.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:03.519
You're not saying, "Go do it now."

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:06.800
You're saying, "You should probably check
the oven."

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800
Great.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.879
The next bonus expression, number 12, is "I
don't want to keep you."

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:17.589
Do you need to get out of a conversation,
or maybe you feel like the other person needs

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:22.709
to leave the conversation and they don't feel
comfortable just saying goodbye?

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:27.660
This is a great way to say, "Okay, I understand
that you need to go," or maybe you're telling

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.480
them, "Hey, I need to go."

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.250
You can say, "Well, I don't want to keep you,
but it was great talking with you."

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.149
You're not saying, "I have to go."

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:40.029
Instead, you're just saying, "I don't want
to keep you in this conversation."

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:41.529
You're trying to be polite about this.

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:43.329
"I don't want to keep you.

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:47.290
It was nice meeting you," or "I don't want
to keep you, so I guess I'll see you the next

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.290
time."

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.559
It's a great expression to add when you're
saying goodbye to someone politely.

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:53.999
That was a lot of polite expressions.

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:54.999
Let's review.

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:57.459
I want you to say these sentences out loud
with me.

00:11:57.459 --> 00:12:01.540
Try to practice pronouncing them, practice
saying them out loud, so repeat them.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.540
Are you ready?

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.480
Would you please tell me where the closest
subway station is?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.079
If you don't mind, would you help put the
dishes in the dishwasher while I put the kids

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:12.079
to bed?

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:16.959
If it's not a problem, could I call you back
in about 10 minutes?

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:20.790
When you have a moment, can you email me those
documents?

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.689
If you get a chance, could you water the plants
too?

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:28.970
By any chance, could you give me a ride home
from work today?

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:34.000
I'd appreciate it if you would have the report
finished by the end of the day.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.620
What if we reschedule for another day because
it's raining today?

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.500
How about if we go out to eat instead?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.290
What do you think about this place?

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:50.240
You should probably check the oven because
I smell something burning.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.740
I don't want to keep you, but it was great
talking.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.990
That was a lot of wonderful polite expressions.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.519
Well, I don't want to keep you, so I'm going
to ask you a quick question.

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:04.420
In the comments, let me know which one of
these polite expressions was new for you.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.759
Can you use it?

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:09.779
