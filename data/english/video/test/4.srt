00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.370
I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishwithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.210
Do you know how to use passive and active
sentences?

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.309
Let's talk about it.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.490
When I was in school my English teachers always
said, don't use passive sentences.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.160
That's not the best way to express something.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.900
But, do you know what?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.539
That's not a reality.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.359
There are specific times and places when you
should use passive sentences.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.660
Today, I'm going to describe what active sentences
are, when to use them, and what passive sentences

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.570
are, and when to use them, because you want
to make sure you're using them in the right

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.300
context, at the right time.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.540
Before we get started, I want to give you
a little test.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.780
I have two sentences, and I want you to guess
which one is active, and which one is passive.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.530
Of course, we haven't talked about this yet,
so you're just using your gut, your instinct

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.430
to tell you which one is active and which
one is passive.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.180
The first sentence is, the dishes weren't
done yesterday.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.790
The second sentence is, I didn't do the dishes
yesterday.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.950
Which one is active and which one is passive?

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.160
Let's talk about the answer to that question
at the end of this lesson.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.460
I'll ask you it again, and I hope that you'll
feel more confident in your answer.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.020
First, let's talk about active sentences.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.563
What I the world are they?

00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:29.240
They key to an active sentence is that the
subject is the one who's doing the action

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.250
of the verb.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.830
That's why they're called active sentences.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.230
There's an action that's happening and the
subject is doing it.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.330
A quick example is that stereotypical time
when maybe you were younger and you came home

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.810
from school and your mom asked you, what'd
you do today?

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.260
Maybe you said, not much.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.780
Maybe you said, nothing.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.480
But let's imagine that you give some kind
of answer.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.890
You might say, well, we studied math.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.299
I took a test.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.240
The teacher read us a book.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.790
The principal yelled at me because I got in
trouble.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.150
These are all active sentences.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.440
The subject is doing the action.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.630
The subject is directly linked to the action.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.950
The best time to use active sentences is when
you're telling a story.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.380
It's engaging, or linking the subject to the
verb, so it's feeling more active.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.600
You're following the story.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.420
There's more action verbs.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.320
This is a great way to tell a story, to write
directly.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.120
If you want to be indirect, this is not the
voice for you.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.070
You should you use passive voice, which we'll
talk about in a moment.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.630
But this is a great way to be direct and to
tell an interesting story.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.959
What's passive voice?

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:48.370
Well, the key to passive voice is that the
subject is not doing the action of the verb.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.910
The person who's doing the action is not the
subject.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.340
Let's imagine that every day when you get
home from work, dinner is made.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.530
Dinner is finished.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.700
Do you know who made dinner?

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700
No.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.300
It's a mystery.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.569
But in this sentence the subject is dinner.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.260
Dinner is made.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.260
That's great.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.200
I would love to come home and dinner would
be already made, and on the table.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.330
That would amazing.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.640
This isn't really the reality in my life,
but maybe it is for you.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.560
You get home from work, and dinner is made.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.970
Dinner is on the table.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.010
Dinner is waiting to be eaten by you.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.750
Who is doing the action here?

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.750
We don't know.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.300
It's not in the sentence, so you might say,
dinner is made by my wife.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.739
Dinner is made by my husband.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.300
Dinner is made by my mom.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.730
Dinner is made.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.250
Dinner is not making itself.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.640
Someone is doing it, but that person is not
the subject of the sentence, and so, voila,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.800
we have a passive sentence.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.910
There are three times that you are going to
use the passive voice.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.840
The first one is when you don't know who did
the action.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.720
Let's imagine that you're car is stolen.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.960
This is a perfect passive voice sentence.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.870
We don't know who did it.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.569
You could say, the thief stole my car.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.239
This is active voice.

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:21.299
But you can really easily use a passive voice
sentence here, and say, my car was stolen.

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.009
Car is the subject, but car is not doing the
action.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.210
The car didn't steal itself, so here we're
using the passive voice, because we don't

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.220
know who did the action.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.379
The second time that you're going to use the
passive voice is when you just don't care

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:37.939
who did the action.

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.020
Maybe it's not important or relevant to your
sentence.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.409
You might say, my car was made in 2010.

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.800
I didn't say, Mazda made my car in 2010.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800
No.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.969
I just said, my car was made.

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:59.050
My car didn't make itself, but I'm not stating
who did the action, because it's just not

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.379
relevant, or it's not important, or maybe
I don't care to share that information with

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:04.379
you.

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.379
I know who did it.

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.379
It's not the first reason.

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.919
I do know who made my car, but I just don't
care to share it with you.

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.249
My car was made in 2010.

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.639
The third time that you're going to use the
passive voice is one of the most useful, and

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.969
this is when you don't want to blame someone
for doing an action.

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.949
Let's imagine that you have an agreement with
your husband, like I do.

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:37.189
In our house, Dan does the dishes and I help
to do a lot of tasks for our baby.

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.749
If he doesn't do the dishes, I might say,
you didn't do the dishes.

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.089
This is an active sentence.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.089
It's direct, and it's clear.

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:50.919
But if I want to be a little bit more polite,
a little bit more indirect, I might say, oh,

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.009
I saw that the dishes weren't done yesterday.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.009
The dishes weren't done.

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.169
I'm not saying, you didn't do the dishes.

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:06.770
We're not stating that the subject here, the
active sentence, you didn't do the dishes.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.210
Instead, it's passive.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.550
It's a little bit more indirect, and depending
on the situation, this could be a good idea,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.029
or a bad idea.

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:20.220
Personally for me with my husband, we would
rather be more direct with each other, especially

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.639
in these kinds of situations.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.479
We don't want to be passive aggressive.

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.419
But in certain situations, especially at work,
this is really a great idea.

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.680
When you want to be indirect, you don't want
to blame someone, so you're going to be more

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.160
indirect.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.749
Let's take a look at a quick work situation
where you're going to hear two people talking

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:44.139
about a task that wasn't done, and they're
trying to figure out who should do it, but

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.990
they're trying to be polite and not blame
anyone.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.210
You're going to hear the active voice used,
and the passive voice used.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.379
I recommend looking at the screen and trying
to follow along, so that you can make these

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:56.569
sentences yourself.

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.000
Hi, Daniel, do you have a moment?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.750
Sure, what's on your mind?

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.710
Well, when I came into work today, I noticed
the boxes didn't get put away last night.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.830
Uh huh, I see.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.509
And so this morning, someone had to put them
away.

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.210
You're saying that you had to put the boxes
away?

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.580
Yes, that's it, and when things don't get
put away, someone needs to spend extra time

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.210
cleaning in the morning.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.740
Ah, yes, yes.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.199
Well, I certainly don't want boxes being left
out, and employees wasting time.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.020
That's why I wanted to bring it to your attention
today.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.439
What should we do?

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:38.289
Well, whose job is it to put everything away
at night?

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:42.349
The problem is that this task isn't assigned
to anyone yet.

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:44.539
You seem like a responsible person.

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:47.649
Why aren't you in charge of boxes at night?

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:50.530
Oh, I guess I could do it.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.530
Excellent.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.169
Then the problem is solved.

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:57.869
I hope you enjoyed that quick conversation
and before we go today, let's return to the

00:07:57.869 --> 00:08:01.479
test sentences that we talked about at the
beginning of this lesson.

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:05.059
The first sentence was, the dishes weren't
done yesterday.

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:09.569
The second sentence was, I didn't do the dishes
yesterday.

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:12.429
Which one is passive and which one is active?

00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:16.580
I hope that now that we've talked about this
a bit, you feel a little bit more comfortable

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.889
choosing one or the other.

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:22.659
The subject, the action, who is doing the
action?

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:26.969
Who is the one that is doing the dishes, or
not doing the dishes?

00:08:26.969 --> 00:08:27.969
It's me.

00:08:27.969 --> 00:08:30.229
I didn't do the dishes.

00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:36.190
I'm the one who's doing the action, so the
second sentence is going to be our active

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.190
sentence.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.310
The first sentence is going to be passive.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.160
The dishes aren't doing themselves.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.500
That would be amazing, actually.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.600
We don't have a dishwasher, so I'm the dishwasher,
or in this situation, actually Dan's the dishwasher

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.600
now.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.750
But we are using the active voice to say,
I didn't do the dishes.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.030
Or, the passive voice, the dishes weren't
done.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.020
Now, I have a challenge for you.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.500
Can you make an active sentence and a passive
sentence and write them in the comments?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.450
Maybe you can let me know about some chores
in your house, and who did them, who didn't

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.960
do them, or maybe you can make it passive
and you don't have to tell me.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:18.090
Just tell me that the sweeping wasn't done
yesterday, or the vacuuming wasn't done yesterday.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.080
You can make it indirect, or passive if you
like.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.360
I hope that you enjoyed this lesson, and learned
a lot.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.950
I know the active and passive voice are really
valuable for improving your English and making

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.820
your sentence structure more complex.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.160
Thanks so much for learning with me, and I'll
see you the next time.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160
