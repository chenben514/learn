Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.450
Are you ready to improve your writing skills?

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.220
Let's talk about it.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.420
Are you ready to write like a pro?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.130
Today, let's talk about my top eight tips
to help you improve your writing skills.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.250
If you ever need to write business emails,
write academic essays, write essays for English

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.390
exams like the IELTS exam you need to practice
perfecting your writing skills.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.280
Throughout these eight tips you're going to
see that in general writing emails is more

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.310
relaxed and more informal than writing essays.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.050
When I write to my tax accountant, when I
write him an email, I say, "Hi George."

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.540
And I keep it clear and simple.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.020
He doesn't have much time, I don't have much
time, so this is the best way to write emails.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.450
But for essays it's a little bit different.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.649
If you're taking the IELTS exam or another
English exam, you can't write just a few sentences.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.829
You can just use bullet points.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.069
You need to write four paragraphs, maybe more.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.110
But the same general principle applies.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
Every word is valuable and powerful.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.560
So you can use these eight tips to make sure
that your language, your writing, impresses

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.890
other people, is clear, and is easy to understand.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.959
Let's talk about them.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:34.929
My first four tips fall under the category
of don't use repetitive or undescriptive phrases.

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.399
Every word needs to be powerful, so if you
are repetitive or if you are not describing

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.500
something with each word, you don't need it.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.119
You need each word to pack a punch.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.099
Pack a punch is a great idiom that means powerful,
you need each word to be powerful.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:53.299
Let's start with the first tip.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.259
First tip is to avoid using the word I. In
emails it's gonna be necessary, you're gonna

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.880
have to say, "I'm writing you to follow up
about something."

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.859
Emails, no problem, but in essays, no way.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.159
Especially essays that are not about your
personal opinion.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.720
Let's take a look at a quick example.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.650
Let's imagine that you're writing an essay
based on the topic what are the advantages

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.219
and disadvantages of social media?

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.360
You might think that you're talking about
your opinion and you should start with, "I

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.959
think that social media ..." But in reality,
cut out I think.

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.280
Start with social media, and then you can
go on to create a beautiful sentence, "Social

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.129
media often creates the illusion of relationships
while leaving users feeling empty inside."

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.989
Great, this is descriptive, it packs a punch,
and does not use the word I.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.110
Number two is contractions.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.370
When you're writing an email it's perfectly
fine to say, "The director isn't available

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.420
at 4PM."

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.560
But when you're writing an essay, an academic
essay, an IELTS essay, an exam essay, no way.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.980
Try to write out the full words.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.299
For example, the graph does not show which
product sold first.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.379
Great, you didn't say, "The graph doesn't
show."

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.120
Instead you said, "The graph does not show."

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120
Excellent.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.700
Simple tip, avoid contractions in essays.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.630
Number three tip is kind of big.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.790
It is avoid boring beginnings.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.110
For example, there is, there are, first, second,
third.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.530
These words don't pack a punch, like I said.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.099
They're not powerful.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.819
So instead of writing, "There are many reasons
why coffee is popular."

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.219
You could say, "Coffee is well loved for three
reasons."

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.290
Excellent.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.090
Each word is powerful.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.090
So what should you use instead of first, second,
third?

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.790
How about some more interesting, expressive,
and advanced expressions like first of all,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.719
first off, to start with.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.390
Great, you're showing that your vocabulary
is beyond just those basic words.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.680
And a little bonus tip.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.049
If you're writing an essay and you have limited
time to write the essay, I recommend when

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.069
you're practicing, memorize five great linking
expressions and use these every time that

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.849
you write an essay or as many times as possible,
so that you can include them and know that

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.750
you're using great vocabulary.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.470
Here are my top five favorite linking expressions.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:28.830
As for, another point to consider is, having
said that, therefore, to conclude.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.069
My fourth tip for avoiding repetitive and
undescriptive words is to avoid the passive

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.639
voice in essay writing.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.710
The passive voice has a great place, there
are times when you should use it.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.639
You can watch my video up here to make sure
that when you use it it's the right time.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.530
But when you're writing an essay, this is
not the time.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.580
Let's take a look at a sample sentence.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.080
The reason why the TV show stopped was because
it was boring.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.060
No, this is not powerful.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.850
This does not pack a punch.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.360
You're using the passive voice.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.389
The reason why the TV show was stopped, it
sounds academic but it is not powerful.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.250
How can we change the sentence to be active
voice?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.970
Viewers stopped watching the TV show due to
the predictable story.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.300
Much better.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.640
Much better.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.050
Here we have the subject doing the action.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.819
Viewers stopped.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.300
This is powerful.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.810
This packs a punch.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.440
Viewers stopped watching due to a predictable
storyline.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.720
That's another great expression, due to.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.280
My fifth, sixth and seventh tip are things
that you should do.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.190
The fifth tip is to stay on topic.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.340
You'd be surprised how many times my students
have started to write about something and

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.460
then they've switched to something else in
the middle of the paragraph, and then gone

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.240
back, and my mind is just going to explode
as I read it.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.169
So, make sure that you stay on topic.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.419
And this is true for emails as well.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.229
Are you writing about Friday's shipment?

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.370
Stick to that topic.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.860
If you have multiple topics, just use bullet
points.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.849
I'd like to email you about ... Great, use
those bullet points to be clear and precise

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:14.849
and short.

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.240
Of course in an essay you're not gonna use
bullet points, but if you have a topic for

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.040
that paragraph, stick to it.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.010
Let's imagine that you're talking about some
of the reasons why coffee is well loved, and

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.010
your first reason is that people enjoy getting
that boost of energy from coffee.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.199
Great, stick to that topic.

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.349
Stick to the boost of energy, that good feeling
that people get.

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.419
Don't talk about addiction, don't talk about
taste, stick to that topic.

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.200
My sixth tip to do is to summarize at the
end.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.830
If it's an email that's only a paragraph,
write a one sentence summary.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.110
I look forward to talking to you again at
9AM on the 15th.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.110
Beautiful.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.290
If it's an essay that's a couple of paragraphs,
write a three to five sentence summary.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.290
Excellent.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.319
Don't forget this tip, it's so valuable.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:09.139
My seventh tip, do not forget, is to check
your writing.

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:15.090
If you're writing an email there is a big
difference between we are choosing to cancel

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.819
our contract and we are not choosing to contract.

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.419
Take a few seconds to read over your email
before you send it.

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:29.379
And for an essay, if you have one minute left,
if you have 30 seconds left before you need

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:32.000
to turn it in, read over it.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.460
Read over it as many times as you can.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.630
Check your writing.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:43.650
My eighth tip and final tip is a bonus, it
is to write every day.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.219
Just like with speaking, if you wanna improve
your speaking you need to speak little by

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:48.350
little every day.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.139
If you wanna improve your writing, you can't
improve your writing just by studying for

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:55.719
three hours one day before your exam.

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:57.950
You need to practice little by little every
day.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.950
So how can you do this?

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.439
One of the easiest ways is to just simply
keep a journal.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:07.629
Every day when you get ready to go to bed,
sit down and write a couple sentences about

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:08.629
your day.

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:13.190
Or if you wrote an email to your boss that
day, think about what you said and try to

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.310
write it in English.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.689
Try to write with that same formal tone.

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:20.490
Or if you're taking an exam soon, write that
essay.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.550
Practice that essay as much as possible.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.070
When you practice day by day, your skills
will increase, you'll be motivated to continue

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.470
because you'll see your progress, and in the
end you really will improve.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.750
And now I have a question for you.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.070
In the comments, let me know, have you ever
needed to write formally in English?

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.670
Maybe a business email, maybe an exam, maybe
an academic essay.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.340
Let me know.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.080
Maybe you need to do it in the future at some
point.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.530
Thanks so much for learning with me, and I'll
see you again next Friday for a new lesson
