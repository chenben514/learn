00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.480
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.200
Let's talk about dates.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.100
I'm not talking about going on a date, I'm
talking about the day, the month, and the

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.100
year.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
Today we're going to be talking about how
to talk about these dates in American English.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.100
I recommend writing down any of these expressions
or sentences that are new for you so that

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.310
you can go back and review them and use them
in your own daily conversations.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.460
Let's get started.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.039
What day is today?

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.280
Today is February 8th, 2019.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.159
Notice that I used in ordinal number, eighth.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:51.809
These ordinal numbers are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 30th, 29th,

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.809
15th.

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.010
These ordinal numbers are necessary for talking
about today's date.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.249
It is February 8th, 2019.

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.320
This is the most general way to describe the
day.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.799
It's February 8th, 2019.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.990
But what if you want to take it up a level?

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.600
You might say, "What day is today?"

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.890
It's February the 8th.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.830
We're adding the word the or the word the
before that ordinal number, February the 8th.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.270
Or you might say, "It's the 8th.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.100
It's the 8th."

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.189
Or you might say, "It's Friday, the 8th.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.650
Notice in all of these examples the word the
comes directly before that ordinal number.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.030
It's the 5th.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.670
It's the 17th.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.740
It's the 30th.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.780
“The” plus the day.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.659
Let's imagine that you have to work next weekend.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.479
You might say, "Oh, I have to work on the
8th.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.939
I have to work on the 8th," or, "I have to
work on the 17th.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.869
It's still directly before that ordinal number.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.479
Let's talk about the next way to describe
dates.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.240
The next category of dates are events.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.069
We talk about events using two different prepositions,
on and in.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.910
Let's start with the first one on, which we
use to talk about the day.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.790
My birthday is on Saturday.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.150
My birthday is on the 4th.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.120
In both of these examples, the word Saturday
and the expression, the 4th, is referring

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.930
to the day.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.599
My birthday is on Saturday.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.980
My birthday is on the 4th.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.730
When's the meeting with Google?

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.490
It's on Friday the 14th.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.150
It's on Friday.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.630
Here we're talking about the day.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.909
Or, you could say, "When's the meeting with
Google?"

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.080
It's on the 14th.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.260
Here's a little extra tip, though.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.159
Unlike “in,” which we're going to talk
about in just a second, the word “on”

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.519
for the day is completely OPTIONAL.

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.620
Let's go back to our first examples with this,
and let's see what it looks like if we take

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.799
out the word “on.”

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.269
My birthday is Saturday.

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.890
My birthday is the 4th.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.769
This is perfectly fine.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.810
So, you've got two options.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.250
My birthday is on Saturday or my birthday
is Saturday.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.250
When's the meeting with Google?

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.450
It's Friday the 14th.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.000
It's on Friday the 14th.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.290
Or without the word “on,” it's Friday
the 14th.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.819
Both of these options are perfectly fine.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.560
Let's go on to the second preposition that
we use to talk about dates, and that is “in.”

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.730
We use “in” to talk about longer periods
of time, months, or years.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.890
My birthday is in September.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.650
This is true, the month of September.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.819
My birthday is in September.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.040
Or, we could say the year.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.739
My birthday is in 1987.

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.909
We have a month and a year and we're using
“in.”

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:07.909
This is required.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.500
Notice, notice, warning, warning.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.769
This is 100% required in the sentence.

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.430
Unlike the previous preposition “on,”
which was optional, this is 100% necessary.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.340
So, make sure that when you're talking about
longer periods of time, my birthday is in

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.720
September, my birthday is in 2007 ... That's
a little bit too recent, but maybe that's

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720
true for you.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.910
Well, you need to use “in.”

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.120
That is required.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.530
Let's go on to talk about how we talk about
years.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.340
How can you say years?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.750
Well, the most general way is to separate
14-92.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.620
We're just having two numbers and putting
them together.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.320
14-92, or you might say 18-12.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.240
You don't need to say one thousand eight hundred
twelve, just 18-12.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.671
But, some thing’s a little bit different
if we're talking about the first couple of

00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:05.380
years of each century.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.710
What if you want to talk about this date?

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.580
How can you pronounce that?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.750
We would say seventeen hundred, seventeen
hundred.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.960
What about the next year after that?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.890
Seventeen oh-one, and then seventeen oh-two,
seventeen oh-three.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.020
We don't say zero.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.590
Usually with dates we say “oh” and this
is a common way to express zero.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.840
Sometimes if you're saying your phone number,
you might say, Oh instead of zero.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.980
You might hear people say that when they're
talking about their phone number.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.150
So when you're talking about the first couple
years of each century.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:53.820
18(oh)5, 18(oh)6, 18(oh)7, 18(oh)8, 18(oh)9,
18-10.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.550
That's when we start to separate it by two
numbers, 18-11, 18-12.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.010
What happens when you reach 2000?

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.800
Well, two different things could happen.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:12.630
The most common is that we say two thousand,
two thousand one, two thousand two, two thousand

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.640
three, two thousand four, two thousand eight,
two thousand ten, two thousand eighteen, two

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.130
thousand nineteen.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:32.320
But, you might also hear once you reach 2010,
you might also hear 20-10, 20-11, 20-18, 20-19.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.790
This is less common, but some people say it.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.530
And if you want to say it, go ahead.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.800
You've got that choice.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.020
Now that we've already talked about days,
months, years, let's talk about decades.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.520
You might say she grew up in the '50s.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.590
She grew up in the '30s.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.130
This implies 1950s, 1930s.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.480
I was born in the '80s.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.400
This implies 1980s.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.580
What if you want to talk about before 1930s?

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.880
What if you want to talk about 1830s, 1790?

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880
What can you say?

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.640
The French Revolution was in the 1790s.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.260
I'm not telling you the specific year, but
just in general, this decade was when the

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.020
French Revolution happened.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.760
The French Revolution was in the 1790s.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.660
DO NOT say, "The French Revolution was in
the '90s."

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.490
If you say this, everyone will think 1990s.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:46.020
So make sure if you're talking about before
19, before that 18, 1790s, 1690s, 1390s, make

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.380
sure that you save the full date, 1790s.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.300
Were any of these ways of expressing dates
new for you?

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.860
I hope it was a good review at least to help
you ingrain these common expressions into

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.860
your mind.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.800
And now I have a question for you.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.070
When's your birthday?

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.530
Let's do a quick review so that I can show
you different ways to talk about your birthday

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.680
in the comments.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.190
My birthday is on September 4th.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:16.970
Remember, “on” is optional, so you could
also say, "My birthday is September 4th."

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:22.200
Or if we're talking about the month, my birthday
is in September.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:29.300
My birthday is in 1987 or my birthday is in
the '80s.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.750
Don't forget that S when you're talking about
the decade.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.129
What if your birthday is this month?

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:38.969
You could say, "My birthday is the 15th."

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:42.329
You don't need to say the month because we
can assume it's this month.

00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:43.620
My birthday is the 15th.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.560
Come and have a party with me.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.860
My birthday is ... All right, I hope that
you can use these expressions in the comments.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.259
Let me know when's your birthday.

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:52.660
Use these great expressions.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.910
Thanks so much for learning English with me,
and I'll see you again next Friday for a new

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.130
