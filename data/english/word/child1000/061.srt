00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,400
November.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,600
November.

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,000
In November, the octopus cannot climb down the tree.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
26.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,200
December.

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,600
December.

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,600
December is the time to share the giant fruit.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,800
27.

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Until.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Until.

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,800
They don't know whether the fruit is sweet until they cut it open.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
28.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
During.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
During.

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,400
During the festival, something falls from the sky.

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
29.

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Next.

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Next.

20
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,400
I will be more careful next time.

21
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
30.

22
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
A go.

23
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
A go.

24
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,400
I fell on your fruit cart a long time ago.
