00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There is only [a little] space left.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They put some small [things] in.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The time capsule is [much] heavier now.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are so [many] things in there.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The hole has enough [space] for the time capsule.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It will be [a lot of] fun to open the box ten years later.
