00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
49.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,400
Should.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,600
Should.

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,400
You [should] see the doctor tomorrow.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
50.

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Shall.

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Shall.

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,600
[Shall] we take him to the doctor now?

9
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,000
51.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Even.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Even.

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,600
He looks sick and may feel [even] worse.

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
52.

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Must.

15
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,000
Must.

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We [must] take him to see the doctor.

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
53.

18
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Away.

19
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Away.

20
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,000
Now we can send him [away] to see the doctor.

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,400
54.

22
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Except.

23
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,800
Except.

24
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,800
He would have fun, [except] he is sick.
