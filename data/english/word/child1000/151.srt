00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Teddy's [little] cousin is eating a big cookie.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,500
[Part] of the cookie is in his mouth.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He cut a little [piece] off his shirt.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
He wants to put [more] things in.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
The feather is [less] heavy than the notebook.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Last but not [least], please play my favorite song.
