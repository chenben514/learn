00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
30. Little. Little.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Teddy's little cousin is eating a big cookie.

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,500
31. Part. Part. Part of the cookie is in his mouth.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
32. Piece. Piece.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He cut a little piece off his shirt.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,500
33. More.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
More. He wants to put more things in.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,500
34. Less. Less.

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
The feather is less heavy than the notebook.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,500
35. Least. Least.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Last but not least, please play my favorite song.
