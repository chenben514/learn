This is a bug. It [lives] in Mr. Pig's hair.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It is a comfortable [place] to live.

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
One day, Mr. Pig almost [kills] the bug.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He sits on the bug and it is [dying].

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Mr. Pig tries to [save] the bug's life.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
[Life] is beautiful.
