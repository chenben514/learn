1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
7. Would. Would.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Would] you bring back a rainbow fish?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
8. R. R.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You [are] a good boy.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
9. It. It.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
[It] is beautiful.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
10. So. So.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The monkey came [so] early.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
11. He. He.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
[He] hits the door.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
12. Then.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The bee can fly higher [than] the monkey.
