00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a [wonderful] day.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He [cuts] some flowers from Teddy's Garden.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Your flowers [grew] feet and ran away.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The flowers are [lying] on the grass.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Why did you [lie] to me?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me [take care of] the dying flowers.
