00:18,138 --> 00:24,453
Milly sat under the apple tree and watched the rain clouds sweep over the hills. -- 
2
00:24,453 --> 00:27,265
What a wet day! -- 
3
00:27,265 --> 00:31,610
She ate an apple and waited for the rain to stop. -- 
4
00:31,610 --> 00:33,651
Soon it did. -- 
5
00:33,651 --> 00:39,946
The sky turned blue again, and the Sun shone, warm and golden. -- 
6
00:39,946 --> 00:43,553
Then she saw the rainbow.  -- 
7
00:43,553 --> 00:49,116
It began as an explosion of light, high in the clouds. -- 
8
00:49,116 --> 00:57,240
The sky filled with dazzling colours: blue, orange, green and purple. -- 
9
00:57,240 --> 01:03,488
Then both ends of the rainbow began to fall to Earth... -- 
10
01:03,488 --> 01:08,263
The rainbow landed in the garden. -- 
11
01:08,263 --> 01:14,95
‘Wow!’ Milly went closer and touched the rainbow.  -- 
12
01:14,95 --> 01:17,444
She felt nothing, just air. -- 
13
01:17,444 --> 01:21,832
But the colours moved beneath her fingers. -- 
14
01:21,832 --> 01:29,133
When she looked up, the rainbow seemed to be stretching on and on into space. -- 
15
01:29,133 --> 01:35,139
'What would happen if I stepped inside it?' she wondered. -- 
16
01:35,139 --> 01:37,857
 There was only one way to find out... -- 
17
01:37,857 --> 01:40,146
She stepped inside. -- 
18
01:40,146 --> 01:44,246
It was beautiful!  -- 
19
01:44,246 --> 01:46,463
And very quiet.  -- 
20
01:46,463 --> 01:48,426
Milly couldn’t hear anything. -- 
21
01:48,426 --> 01:50,567
She looked up.  -- 
22
01:50,567 --> 01:53,507
The rainbow seemed to go on forever... -- 
23
01:53,507 --> 01:57,737
WHOOSH! Milly was sucked up by the rainbow.  -- 
24
01:57,737 --> 01:59,801
It was a tunnel of light.  -- 
25
01:59,801 --> 02:03,327
She whizzed along like a button up a vacuum cleaner.  -- 
26
02:03,327 --> 02:06,234
Wind whistled past her ears.  -- 
27
02:06,234 --> 02:14,233
She tumbled over and over but didn’t hurt herself: she was carried on a soft cushion of air.  -- 
28
02:14,233 --> 02:19,134
 Up and up and up she went, so fast. -- 
29
02:19,134 --> 02:22,153
But rainbows go up... -- 
30
02:22,153 --> 02:24,928
and rainbows come down.  -- 
31
02:24,928 --> 02:29,446
Soon she was falling down the far side of the rainbow.  -- 
32
02:29,446 --> 02:31,627
She could see green below. -- 
33
02:31,627 --> 02:36,369
Green grass, rushing up to meet her, faster and faster... -- 
34
02:36,369 --> 02:41,760
BUMP! She landed hard, but nothing was broken. -- 
35
02:41,760 --> 02:44,155
Milly stood up.  -- 
36
02:44,155 --> 02:49,324
She was on the other side of the valley, standing on a steep green hill. -- 
37
02:49,324 --> 02:52,76
She could see her house, far away. -- 
38
02:52,76 --> 02:56,704
It was like a tiny white box with a rainbow in the garden. -- 
39
02:56,704 --> 03:02,465
Everything was calm and peaceful and very lovely... -- 
40
03:02,465 --> 03:10,133
WHOOSH! Suddenly she was shooting back through the rainbow, faster than a firework. -- 
41
03:10,133 --> 03:14,957
Red, blue, yellow ... stripes of light, flashing by. -- 
42
03:14,957 --> 03:21,372
Up, up, up she went and down, down, down...  -- 
43
03:21,372 --> 03:26,345
BUMP. She landed back in her own garden. -- 
44
03:26,345 --> 03:29,790
'Oww...!’ Milly groaned.  -- 
45
03:29,790 --> 03:33,268
‘I am going to be so bruised tomorrow.' -- 
46
03:33,268 --> 03:35,846
Then she had a thought... -- 
47
03:35,846 --> 03:41,120
'GOLD! There is always gold at the end of a rainbow!' -- 
48
03:41,120 --> 03:45,139
She dropped to her knees and started to dig.  -- 
49
03:45,139 --> 03:51,669
The earth flew out behind her, covering the grass with stones and soil. -- 
50
03:51,669 --> 03:57,754
'Come on, come on! It must be here somewhere...' -- 
51
03:57,754 --> 04:00,840
She went deeper and deeper.  -- 
52
04:00,840 --> 04:06,352
Then she saw something shiny, under her fingertips. -- 
53
04:06,352 --> 04:07,860
She pulled it out. -- 
54
04:07,860 --> 04:10,187
'Gold...' -- 
55
04:10,187 --> 04:14,536
Milly stared at it, breathless with excitement. -- 
56
04:14,536 --> 04:20,821
 It was a golden coin, bigger than usual money and much heavier.  -- 
57
04:20,821 --> 04:22,565
She rubbed it clean.  -- 
58
04:22,565 --> 04:29,706
There were words written on it: Make a wish before the rainbow fades. -- 
59
04:29,706 --> 04:37,297
'Oh wow!' she said. 'This is amazing! A wish!' -- 
60
04:37,297 --> 04:43,113
Her head began to fill with ideas, everything she could wish for. -- 
61
04:43,113 --> 04:46,138
But then she saw something.  -- 
62
04:46,138 --> 04:49,264
The rainbow was starting to fade. -- 
63
04:49,264 --> 04:52,303
It was going thin at the edges. -- 
64
04:52,303 --> 04:57,837
'No! I haven't made up my mind! Please - wait!' -- 
65
04:57,837 --> 05:00,658
But the rainbow didn't wait. -- 
66
05:00,658 --> 05:06,180
It was fading. Going away, and taking her wish with it. -- 
67
05:06,180 --> 05:10,676
'No! I’ll make my wish soon. Just a moment, please!' -- 
68
05:10,676 --> 05:14,34
But still the rainbow was fading.  -- 
69
05:14,34 --> 05:17,491
The golden coin was getting hot in her hand. -- 
70
05:17,491 --> 05:22,242
'Ohh....! Choose... choose... Yes. YES! I have it!' -- 
71
05:22,242 --> 05:27,652
Milly closed her eyes and made her wish and VOOMF! -- 
72
05:27,652 --> 05:32,224
The rainbow disappeared, and so did the golden coin. -- 
73
05:32,224 --> 05:35,668
Milly hardly dared to move. -- 
74
05:35,668 --> 05:38,583
Had her wish come true? -- 
75
05:38,583 --> 05:40,45
Maybe. -- 
76
05:40,45 --> 05:41,717
She looked up.  -- 
77
05:41,717 --> 05:44,299
The sky was peacock blue. -- 
78
05:44,299 --> 05:48,215
The Sun was golden, warm on her face. -- 
79
05:48,215 --> 05:51,267
Such a beautiful day. -- 
80
05:51,267 --> 05:54,423
Such a beautiful world. -- 
81
05:54,423 --> 06:02,369
'Even if the wish doesn't come true, I am a very lucky girl,' she said.
 -- 
82
06:02,369 --> 06:06,347
And she smiled. --
