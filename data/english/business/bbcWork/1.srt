00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,780
Narrator: Hi I'm Neil. Thanks for joining
me on English at Work - <em>a new series (全新系列)</em> of programmes

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,660
set in an office, full of top tips to help you

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,250
learn some useful business language which you

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,430
could use in the workplace.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,820
In the next few minutes you can join me on
an introductory tour around one of London's

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:34,010
biggest imitation plastic fruit manufacturers,
called Tip Top Trading. We're going to hear

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,610
from some of the employees that work so hard
to keep the business running smoothly.

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,140
So come on then! Let's step into the office
and <em>eavesdrop(偷聽)</em> on Tip Top Trading's possible

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,520
newest recruit. I say 'possible' because she is still being interviewed for the job of Sales Executive

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,420
Anna: Firstly, this job is an ideal match
for my skills and experience: I've spent

11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,090
several years working in sales and <em>
    I get on
    with people easily(我很好相處)
</em>. Well, I

12
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,850
mean, apart from the ones I don't like of
course! Secondly, I know Tip Top

13
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,670
Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies
in London, and I want to

14
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,750
be part of that.

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,869
Paul: That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading
is the fastest-growing company in

16
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:24,710
the plastic fruits sector.

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:31,210
Narrator: <em>Well said(說得好)</em>, Anna! If she gets that
job I'm sure she'll be an asset to the company.

18
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,320
The decision is in the hands of Manager, Paul,
who we heard there. He's a nice guy really,

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,920
a little <em>disorganised(雜亂無章)</em>, but when things go
wrong he's got to take charge a bit like this

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,509
 

21
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:48,740
Paul: Yesterday was not a great day. Two clients
came in with serious

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,719
complaints. Mrs Kumquat received a delivery
of imitation bananas that

23
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:59,810
were purple - <em>not very convincing(不太有說服力)</em>, and Mr
Lime ordered grapefruits, but

24
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,189
got pineapples. Tom!

25
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,829
Tom: Yeah, listen...

26
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,399
Paul: Were you responsible for these errors?

27
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,659
Tom: Well... yes, but -

28
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,480
Paul: Look, mistakes happen. But it seems
that Mrs Kumquat left our offices

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,690
even angrier than when she came in and she
says she will never use Tip

30
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,120
Top Trading again!

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,650
Tom: I tried my best.

32
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,609
Paul: Hmmm.

33
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:27,230
Narrator: Ah yes, Tom! I hadn't warned you
about Tom, one of the company's top Sales

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,230
Executives - he's good...

35
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,910
Tom: (on phone) Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie!
So what's the latest, are we on?

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,699
... but his interpersonal skills need working
on. Listen to this!

37
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:45,750
Tom:<em> My computer has crashed(我電腦當機了)</em>. I've lost my
phone. And there's a big, BIG

38
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,109
problem with my timetable. I have two meetings
scheduled at the same

39
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:56,790
time with two extremely important clients.
I can't do them both at once!

40
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,970
See what I mean! Now, every office needs a
good office assistant - and Tip Top Trading

41
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:10,239
is no exception. It's got Denise, who's there to assist, organise and sometimes make the tea...

42
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,299
Denise: Oh sorry excuse me, here's your tea

43
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:15,299
Paul.

44
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,419
Paul: Thanks Denise.

45
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,540
Narrator: But goodness! She likes to talk...

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,930
Denise: Really! 'Denise do this! Denise do
that!' I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost

47
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,090
had enough! <em>
    I get treated like I'm some kind
    of servant!(我被當佣人對待)
</em>

48
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,070
Narrator: That's Denise! I think we'll just
leave the office now and let them get on with

49
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,780
their work

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,570
So that's Tip Top Trading. There are plenty
of other people we'll meet along the way...

51
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,190
so go on, why don't you join me for English
at Work from bbclearningenglish.com. See ya!
