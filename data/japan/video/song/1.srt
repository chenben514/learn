00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,900
Making my way down town

1
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,100
Walking fast

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Faces pass

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,100
And I'm home bound

4
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,900
Staring blankly ahead

5
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,100
Just making my way

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,500
Making a way

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,900
Through the crowd

8
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,200
And I need you

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,700
And I miss you

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,400
And now I wonder

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,700
If I could fall

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,200
Into the sky

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,700
Do you think time

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,100
Would pass me by

15
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,800
'Cause you know I'd walk a
thousand miles

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If I could just see you, tonight

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,200
It's always times like these

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
When I think of you

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,900
And I wonder If you ever think of me

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,200
'Cause everything's so wrong

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,500
And I don't belong

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,800
Living in

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,400
Your precious memory

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
'Cause I need you

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,900
And I miss you and now I wonder

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,200
If I could fall

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Into the sky

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Do you think time

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,800
Would pass me by, oh

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,500
'Cause you know I'd walk a
thousand miles

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,700
If I could just see you tonight

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,600
And I, I don't want to let you know I,

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,500
I drown in your memory I,

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,300
I don't want to let this go

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,600
I,I don't.

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,500
Making my way down town walking fast

37
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,700
Faces pass

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,500
And I'm home bound

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,300
Staring blankly ahead

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Making my way

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,800
Making a way

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,100
Through the crowd

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,300
And I still need you

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,300
And I still miss you

45
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,000
And now I wonder

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,800
If I could fall into the sky

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,900
Do you think time, would pass us by

48
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,400
'Cause you know I'd walk a
thousand miles

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,500
If I could just see you, now

50
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,100
If I could fall into the sky

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,900
Do you think time would pass me by

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,500
'Cause you know I'd walk a
thousand miles

53
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,700
If I could just see you

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:08,000
If I could just hold you, tonight.
